# The art of product management | Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:03):
There's no one out there today who shares more wisdom, more consistently on the art of product management than Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas came out of nowhere a few years ago and started tweeting gems of insight about building product and the role of product management, and rightfully so, has built a huge following on Twitter. What I love about Shreyas is that his insights are often framed in really memorable and interesting ways and they're often contrarian and not ideas that you've heard elsewhere. Shreyas has worked at some of today's most important tech companies, including Yahoo, Twitter, Google, and most recently Stripe, both as an IC and a manager. And his advice is always rooted in his real life experiences at these companies.

(00:00:48):
In our chat, we focus on five topics and go deep on them. We talk about the power of pre-mortems. We talk about how to best use your time as a product manager. We look into the three levels of product work and how getting them wrong often leads to tension on your team. We dig into why most execution problems are really strategy problems. And we talk about a common pitfall in prioritization. And if you listen to the end, we actually throw in a bonus topic. I really appreciate that Shreyas made the time for our chat and I cannot wait for you to hear it.

(00:01:29):

Shreyas, the man, the myth, the legend, thank you so much for joining me and for having this conversation.

Shreyas Doshi (00:03:48):
It's great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:49):
So we strategized about how to make this podcast as concretely useful and actionable for as many people as possible. And so, we decided to do is instead of a regular interview where we talk about a lot of stuff, instead we're going to go deep on five of your ideas, teachings, lessons that you've shared on Twitter that have stuck with me, and I know have resonated with a lot of other people and we're going to call it the five big ideas from Shreyas Doshi. Does that sound about right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:04:14):
Sounds great.

Lenny (00:04:15):
Okay, cool. So before we get into that, before we get into the meat of all this stuff, you share a lot of wisdom on Twitter, but you don't share a ton of about yourself and your background, where you grew up, where you're born and things like that. So I'd love to learn a little bit more about the human that is Shreyas. And so, maybe we start there, where were you born, where'd you grow up, what'd your parents do for work, what did you want to be when you grew up?

Shreyas Doshi (00:04:36):
So I was born in Mumbai, Bombay, India, and I lived there for the first 21 years of my life. I actually did not really even get to see many parts of India while I grew up in India and basically just was in Mumbai the whole time. And then I moved here to the United States for graduate studies at age 21. My parents, my father was a businessman, and so, he started his own business. He manufactured spices and marketed them. So growing up, I saw him work on packaging and pricing. And when he was short on staff, I used to be packaging the spices into the little box or creating some marketing material for him, not the creative part, but the grunt work. So I grew up in that environment where the lines between what was my dad's business and our personal lives were very blurred.

(00:05:32):
My mother just growing up as a homemaker, and so, my dad was largely just busy and all consumed in his business. And I ended up spending a lot of time growing up with my mother. And so, both of them have had a pretty significant influence in different ways, but both significant influence on who I am. When I grew up, I changed that a lot. I think when I was very young, one of my uncle is a doctor, so I saw him and I was like, "Oh, maybe I should be a doctor." And at some point later, I changed that. In high school, I took French and I ended up being really good at it, surprisingly good at it, and I was very passionate about it.

(00:06:10):
So for a while, I was thinking, "Oh, I'll maybe teach French after graduate from college. Maybe I'll go to France, learn the language a little more. And maybe I'll teach French." That lasted for a few years and turned out that I ended up not pursuing that, and instead, got a degree in computer engineering. Partly, I think because in India back then, if you were good at science and mathematics, you would usually take up engineering. And so, that's what I ended up doing. I was also quite passionate about computers, so maybe that was part of it. But once I started on that path, it became much clearer what I wanted to do.

Lenny (00:06:50):
How's your French these days?

Shreyas Doshi (00:06:51):
Very bad. Sad to say, my son is now taking French and I am just embarrassed at my inability to assist him in any way, other than to point out some conjugation errors.

Lenny (00:07:04):
So you said you studied computer engineering, that's what you moved to the US for, how did you move from that to product?

Shreyas Doshi (00:07:11):
So, I started my career as an engineer, or well, backtracking, so I completed my undergrad in India, came here to the United States to pursue a PhD in computer science. About one month in, I realized that PhD in academia wasn't for me, so I decided that I was going to drop out of the PhD program. And once I dropped out, this was like 2001, 2002 so the climate was very different, there were basically no jobs for tech people. Certainly there were no jobs for people who required a visa, which I did. So it was very difficult, but I ended up working as an engineer at a couple of startups and that started my career in tech. I was an engineer for about four or five years. And when I moved here to the San Francisco Bay Area, I got a little taste of product management.

(00:08:00):
So, I was part of this team that used to be Loudcloud, and they were acquired by a larger company EDS at that time, so it was a startup team within a larger organization. And I was an engineer there and I just started doing some product work. And I found that my managers over the time would send me to customer meetings. We had an internal product, so these were internal customers. And I thought it was a little surprising because I was fairly junior and I was an engineer, but I was like, "Okay, I'll just go to the customer meetings." And I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed understanding what our customers were trying to do, helping them out. I also enjoyed thinking about creative ways to solve their needs and whatnot. So, that was my taste of product management.

(00:08:40):
For about a year, I was doing the product job without having the title and I was also the engineer. So I was in this great state where I'd figure out what needed to be built and I would just build it myself. So, that's how I started. And at some point during that one year, I realized that while I was a good engineer, I was perhaps a top 20% engineer. I realized that I would never be a great engineer, that I would never be a top 10% engineer because I saw those engineers, the fortune of working with them, and I just could tell that I couldn't be that. And I increasingly got interested in this product thing, so I said, "Okay, let's try out this product thing." And so, that's really what started my product career. And I think what I have to be really thankful and grateful for there is the people who gave me a chance to do the product work and there were many people involved. And so, I think without their support, it would've been much harder for me to become a product manager.

Lenny (00:09:34):
I didn't know that you moved from engineering to product and your journey is very similar to mine where I was also an engineer. And once I got to Airbnb, I was like, "Okay, I am not good. And I will not last as an engineer at a company like this. And I should think about what other options exist." And it worked out great. And so, I wonder how often that happens of PMs moving into PM because they aren't going to make it as an engineer.

Shreyas Doshi (00:09:57):
I think it might be a common occurrence because engineering is a really great job, particularly on empowered teams, as an engineer, you can do a lot. You don't have to just write code, but you can do a lot. And so, I also think it's a great place for people to start their career if they have a technical background and if they enjoy the part about building software. Because sometimes people will ask me, "Hey, I'm doing this technical degree, whether it's computer science or something else, but I want my first job to be product management." And I often respond with, "Tryout engineering because, again, in many companies, fortunately these days you can do a lot more than just the core engineering job. And so you get exposure to many different things. And once you do that, you can decide what path to pick."

Lenny (00:10:44):
It's such a bonus to have that background as a PM. I wanted to go back, so you mentioned that you worked at Loudcloud. I had no idea. That was Marc Andreessen's second company, right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:10:53):
Yes. I joined that team. Again, this was a time when there were very scared jobs in the valley and I was interviewing with them for nine months or something like that, and they had just been acquired by EDS. So they split into two companies. One got acquired by EDS and the other became Opsware, which was the product company. And so, I joined the Loudcloud part of that organization.

Lenny (00:11:17):
Got it. Is there something that you took away from that company? Was Marc Andreessen still working there? And I think Ben Horowitz also.

Shreyas Doshi (00:11:24):
Yeah, they were still there, they were working on the Opsware side. Again, because even though I was hired as an engineer, the non-engineer task I was given was to manage a relationship with Opsware because the way that split worked is EDS would use Opswares data center automation technology, and my team was responsible for deploying and supporting that technology for EDS. And so, I was given this role of managing the vendor relationship and I have no idea. I'm in my early 20s, I have no idea how to manage vendor relationships, but I ended up doing that.

(00:11:59):
And as part of that, I got an opportunity to work with many folks over at Opsware, including folks on the leadership team there. And that was my first experience of what a really highly talented and energetic team looks like, both on the Opsware side, like I said, I worked with a number of people there, but also on the former Loudcloud side who were my team members. And that magic, a very high caliber team, people who really great at their job and brought high degree of energy and collaboration to their work. I was just lucky to have been part of that team early on.

Lenny (00:12:32):
And then following that, you worked at a bunch of really important well run successful companies, Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, what's one thing you took away from each of these companies that you've worked at that has stuck with you? You share a lot of this on Twitter, but if you just think about somebody took away from each of these companies or even the founders that ran these companies, what might those be?

Shreyas Doshi (00:12:53):
Yeah, let's do this rapid fire style because you know me, I could spend an hour just talking about this topic. But just starting with Yahoo, I think I learned the importance of building multiple services under a single account. I think that was the one Yahoo ID was such a powerful thing. It wasn't easy to pull off back in the day and Yahoo was perhaps the first company that pulled it off really well. And so, that idea of bundling under a single account, which then Google really did extremely well later on was something that I got to experience very first hand because I was working on the identity team at Yahoo. Google taught me the.

Lenny (00:13:33):
Real quick on Yahoo because it makes me think about it. I remember they tried to do that with Flickr and they had a bunch of trouble with that, people on Flickr didn't want to log in with Yahoo, is that right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:13:42):
Yes. That's the story of every acquisition that are some raving fans of the service that are perhaps not entirely happy about their beloved service being acquired by a large company. In fact, we encountered this at Google as well. If you remember YouTube accounts used to be separate from Google accounts or Gmail accounts. And at some point, Google decided that you should be able to use your Google account to log into YouTube, and also over time, that everybody who uses YouTube should have a Google account. So they went through a multi-year migration of accounts, and they had similar backlash. The interesting part though, is nobody remembers that now, people happily use YouTube. So this is one of those things where sometimes it's painful in the short-term, even though it might actually be the right answer over the long-term.

Lenny (00:14:36):
Great advice. Okay. Sorry I cut you off. Google.

Shreyas Doshi (00:14:38):
Yes. Google, I think the main thing I learned was the power of thinking really big. And I know it sounds like a platitude, but really big. And I only actually realized that when I left Google and I started working with the other teams and these were all capable teams and I was struck by how many teams just limited the potential of what they could achieve. And I think Google helped people think big by default. And so, I think the six years I spent at Google really helped me understand that really well and just make it a normal part of how I operated. So that was really useful for me.

Lenny (00:15:18):
Is there an example at Google that some of you worked on that was like, "Holy shit. This was going to be big or let's think bigger about this"?

Shreyas Doshi (00:15:25):
Well, as with anything, there's pluses and minuses. So I worked on the ads team at Google for a number of years and there was this unwritten rule of thumb that, hey, if it's not going to generate more than $100 million in revenue, it's not worth talking about it. Because the ads business was growing so fast and was so large that we would regularly not pursue opportunities that were just quote $100 million. So why do that? That's because Google had access to billion dollar opportunities for it as business. So they were very clear on pursuing the big opportunities. And in some cases, these opportunities were not obvious, so we had to create those opportunities. If you think about some of the innovations Google brought over the years in monetization, including things like video ads and whatnot, those were not obvious opportunities, but Google decided that it wanted to pursue those big opportunities.

(00:16:22):
And in order to do that, it had to sometimes just let go of these seemingly smaller opportunities. So that tendency to think about, well, yes, there is $10 million business here, but can we make it $100 million business? Or there is a $1 million business here, can we make it a $10 million business? What does it take to make it bigger is a habit, I think, that got ingrained for me at Google. Now, of course, there's the other side of it, which is, I think, Google missed out on some trends simply because of this filter or this high bar where sometimes it's not clear if something is $100 million opportunity or $1 billion opportunity. So that is a downside of this. What I mainly took away is for instance, even at Stripe, when I joined, I was just thinking a lot bigger about the business. I was responsible for Stripe Connect and that helped us make different decisions about what to prioritize and at what pace to go after it. So, that was Google.

(00:17:21):
Moving on to Twitter. I think at Twitter, the main thing that struck me with all the challenges, they had infrastructure challenges and also some challenges around leadership and culture is just the stickiness that comes with combining network effects with core product differentiation, because Twitter had both. We talk about network effects all the time and I don't have much more interesting things to add beyond what's already added. But this combination of core product differentiation, because if you think about it, there's still no product like Twitter, despite now being a long time since the product was launched. And that core product differentiation combined with network effects has what enabled Twitter to have the staying power it's had. And I think unless something terrible happens, I think Twitter will be around for a really long time. So, that's something I got to observe very closely when I worked at Twitter.

(00:18:13):
And then at Stripe, I think the main thing I took away was that when you combine high energy sound judgment, low ego and small teams, you just get magic. And so, Stripe wasn't by any means flawless, but I saw that combination of high energy sound judgment, low ego and small teams more at Stripe than any other place I've been at. And so, that was very impactful and my growth and thinking as a leader. And I can go on with the founders, because I know you had asked that question.

Lenny (00:18:45):
Let's do it.

Shreyas Doshi (00:18:46):
Okay. With regards to the founders and what I learned from the founders, Yahoo, I didn't work much with the founders. At Google, I had some interactions. I was in meetings with Larry, Sergey, Eric Schmidt. And I think particularly if I were to pick one thing, I really appreciated Larry's strategic insight and particularly his ability to simulate the future to make better decisions. And so Twitter, I just overlapped very briefly with Jack's comeback as CEO back when he came back. And I think I was struck by his ability to listen and ask great questions in a few meetings that I was with him. And so, I was really impressed like he would just listen a lot more than you would expect, say, the CEO to listen. And then he would just ask one vital question and that's something I've tried to use in my leadership style ever since I saw that.

Lenny (00:19:38):
Is there an example of that or a story of that happening that you think about?

Shreyas Doshi (00:19:42):
I forget the details and they're not that important anyway. But there was a time when we were discussing a potential acquisition and I was on the fence on that acquisition, it would be something that my team would acquire, Jack was in the room. And I remember we went through as is common in many corporate settings. We went through all the pros and cons and all the intellectual arguments and the strategic arguments and the metrics arguments and all of that. And Jack was just listening through all of that. And then I remember very distinctly, he asked me one question which was something to the effect of, how does this make our users love Twitter more? Simple question. But then at that point I realized, yeah, we never really talked about that because we were so engrossed in all the other stuff. And we talked about it as a proxy because we were talking about metrics and impact and integration and those sorts of things.

(00:20:40):
So I still remember that. I still remember him asking a simple question. Frankly at the time I did not have a good answer to that question. So that was a lesson for me to get more rigorous about my own thinking.

Lenny (00:20:52):
That's a question that a lot of PMs would hear and be like, "Oh my God. Come on, man. We're trying to move some metrics here." But I love that you took that as like, okay, I really find this really important. And this is a really important question to think about and as a lesson of how to approach this kind of stuff. So I love that. I think you were going to talk about Stripe too, right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:21:08):
Yes. Stripe, I worked a lot with Patrick and John. John was my manager for a while. And from John, I learned a lot about marketing. John is a master marketer. Among many other things that he's absolutely great at, he's just a great marketer. And I just learned a lot about how to think about talking about the product in terms that, again, obvious stuff, but talking about product in terms that customers really understand. And then sometimes emphasizing things that we as product people might not think are really important, because maybe we didn't spend much time on building it, and we want to talk about things that we spent a lot of time that are truly innovative, etc., etc. And John would often make, again, these observations about, well, if we just talked about the product in this manner, that will likely resonate a lot more with customers.

(00:22:00):
And that got me thinking a lot about how I need to reframe my approach to basically separate the effort involved in building something with the effort you want to put behind talking about said thing. And that doesn't have to be the same features that you talk about. So, that's something I learned a lot working with John. From Patrick, I think the main thing I learned was just how to think and communicate more clearly. Patrick did that extremely well. And then overall from both, I learned the importance of setting the culture you want, simply by consistently being an example of the behaviors you want to replicate in the organization. So instead of talking about values, I saw both of them just live the values that they wanted the company to replicate, especially as the company was scaling. So, whether it's a culture of being user centric or it's a value around humility, they just lived those values so consistently. And I think that consistency spoke louder than anything that you might write on a poster on the office walls.

Lenny (00:23:08):
It's just hearing you describe all these companies and all these founders that you've worked with, it's pretty incredible to set of experiences that you've had and the primordial soup in which you became a PM. And it explains a lot about how you're able to squeeze so much wisdom and insights about the role of product management and the art and skill of product management, because you've seen so many ways of doing it and so many companies that have done in different ways. And so, it's a good segue to shifting to talk about the five big ideas. The first is around this concept of pre-mortems, this is something that stuck with me when you tweeted it. I think it was a couple years ago at this point and I see it come up occasionally in your tweets and amongst people chatting your super follower threads. And so, I also like that there's something you can actually implement and act on pretty quickly and see impact. And so, curious to hear your thoughts on this idea of pre-mortem just unpack this idea for folks.

Shreyas Doshi (00:23:58):
We're all familiar with a post-mortem or as they call it in the military, I think, after action reviews. So every company I've worked at, we've had some form of post-mortem when a launch had problems or an initiative did not go as planned or we suffered an unacceptable system downtime. Somebody would say, "Oh, we need to post-mortem that." And over the years, I really saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem. Some really great insights came out of a post-mortem about what went wrong and what we could have done better. And as I saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem, that's what made me wonder, why do we need to wait until after things go wrong? Because why can't we extract some of these insights before they go wrong? And it was around that time that I discovered the idea of a pre-mortem. I learned about it from an Harvard business review article written by Gary Cline.

(00:24:50):
And the idea is simple, which is when you are working on an important project or initiative, you get together with your team early on in the products or the projects' life to see in advance what could go wrong. And the way I describe a pre-mortem is that if you do a pre-mortem right, you will not have to do an ugly post-mortem. You might still do a post-mortem to learn, but odds are very high that it is not going to be a bad post-mortem. And the genius of the pre-mortem ritual is the initial prompt. So it's not just about like, well, what could go wrong? The initial prompt is the genius, which is the prompt starts with, imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now, let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves what went wrong, what could have contributed to this utter failure.

(00:25:47):
And that's how a pre-mortem meeting will start. The leader will start with this prompt. And then the way the meeting goes is you ask your team members to share what could have caused this utter failure, and the magic of this type of approach where you work backwards from a failed outcome. A hypothetical failed outcome is that it just somehow enables two things. One is much greater psychological safety for team members to talk about things they're concerned about, but that they were just hesitant to bring up because nobody likes to be negative in modern organizations, everybody wants to be optimistic and positive. So a pre-mortem setting gives everybody the license to actually think about what can go wrong. So, that psychological safety is a big, big factor in why a pre-mortem works.

(00:26:40):
And what I've found is at Stripe, I did this regularly with launches that my team was involved in. Sometimes some teams or some people were just surprised or skeptical like, how is it really going to work? And then we go through the pre-mortem meeting and there's a whole process that we can talk about. But as we complete the meeting, I ask everybody, so how did that go? And just everybody is smiling, even though we've spent say 30 minutes or an hour, just talking about terrible scenarios of things that could go wrong, but everybody's feeling a little lighter because its great catharsis for them. So that becomes really important.

(00:27:14):
And the last kind of thing I found with pre-mortems now that I've done them with various other companies as well, that I advise and whatnot is the shared vocabulary and the shared vocabulary that you get about being able to talk about things that will fail. So I have a specific approach, which is I ask the team to talk about three things. Each member on the team should bring up three things. One is a tiger. So you can bring up tigers in the shared doc that we create. And a tiger is a threat that will actually kill us, just like a tiger would. So these are actual problematic things that could be really harmful to the product or the project. So, that's a tiger.

(00:27:51):
The other is paper tiger. So this is a seeming threat that others might be worried about, but you're not worried about. So that's the paper tiger. And then the last one, and I think this one was also used at Airbnb in other ways is elephant. And the elephant in the room that nobody is talking about. So it might not be a tiger, it won't kill us, but you're still worried that we are not seeing reality as it is that. And so, an elephant could be like, well, we are assuming that just because we launch this and do a bunch of PR that we'll get users, but are we sure we're going to get users? That's the elephant in the room that nobody is talking about that, again, this gives you that psychological safety to bring it up.

(00:28:28):
And then what I noticed as I ran pre-mortems is that in future meetings that the team had where I wasn't even present, people started talking about, "Oh, I have this tiger. Can I bring up this tiger?" And all of a sudden it became okay for people to bring those things up, which I think is perhaps the best part about a pre-mortem is that shared vocabulary.

Lenny (00:28:45):
Such a simple idea that is clearly going to benefit you and your team. And it's interesting that people don't often do this, or haven't even thought about doing this. And so, just to get a little bit deeper, how do you actually execute this meeting? Who do you invite? What are the questions you ask? When exactly do you do this, that kind of stuff?

Shreyas Doshi (00:29:02):
And so, as I started doing pre-mortem, they got more and more popular at Stripe, other teams started doing them, and then afterwards I helped some startups also do pre-mortems. And at some point, I decided I should just write down my template for pre-mortems. So I worked with the folks at Coda to create a Coda doc, which you can find, and we can put in the show notes if possible, basically that's an entire template for how to run pre-mortems using this method that I talked about, including tigers, paper tigers, elephants, all of that. The main thing about a pre-mortem is to include people from every function that is going to be involved in, say, if you're doing a launch. And so, if it's a really large launch, sometimes I will separate it into two groups. One is everything related to the engineering side of things. Usually the engineering team is fairly large, so you can bring in every engineer. So, that's really important. Every engineer needs to be in the meeting, and so, it might be a meeting of 10, 15, 20, whatever engineers, and maybe a PM, maybe a design counterpart, and so on.

(00:30:07):
That's just focused on the product engineering side of things like what could go wrong. And then again, for a large launch, I like doing a separate pre-mortem for the go-to-market side. And so that will involve sales team, support team, marketing team, involve design team. Some of the core engineering leads will also need to be at that meeting. Over there, we'll talk about more of the go-to-market risks. So that's what I like to do for a very large launch.

(00:30:35):
For a smaller launch, I just like to do one meeting where everybody is present. And like I said, start with the prompt of, imagine this has failed. So as the pre-mortem meeting leader, it's my responsibility to share the prompt. And then I like doing these pre-mortems where we alternate between speaking and quiet time. So I'll share the prompt and then I'll say, okay, now the next five minutes or the next 10 minutes is quiet time where I already have that template, like the quarter doc where people start entering their own tigers and paper tigers, and elephants in a way that nobody else sees. And so, people do that, and then we go around the room and share.

(00:31:11):
And the one other innovation I added as I did this often was also, after people shared, I ask people to pick the tiger that they find more scary, but that somebody else mentioned, so not their own tiger, but some other tiger that somebody else mentioned that they found more scary. So, that ends up being people basically are voting. And then as the pre-mortem leader, it's my responsibility to take all of that output that the team has generated in this document and then prioritize. Because again, the point is not to solve every problem, the point is to identify threats that we are not talking about openly or that we might just be missing, or we might be assuming that somebody else is going to deal with it only to find nobody was thinking about it. So then I like to create a pre-mortem action plan and then share that with the team and keep myself as the leader accountable for actually making progress on it.

Lenny (00:32:04):
Having started doing this, have you noticed a less need for post-mortems, basically projects failing less than having less problems? What impact have you seen executing on this idea?

Shreyas Doshi (00:32:13):
Absolutely, I've seen us identify certain issues that just wouldn't have come up and likely you can't really run a simulation and see what that actually looked like in real life. But those likely would have resulted in a problematic situation afterwards. A great example is sometimes you'll see a company announce something and they have massive backlash. And then one reasonable observer might say, "Well, how did this company miss this?" because what happens is they have the backlash, then the company realizes, "Oh, we have this backlash." Then they start doing damage control. They sometimes might even backtrack and undo whatever they did. They'll say, "Sorry, we didn't think about these issues. Give us some more time and we'll come back, and we'll perhaps relaunch the feature, but in a better way."

(00:33:00):
To the casual observer, it may seem like that it should have been obvious and sometimes it's not, but oftentimes I agree, it should be obvious to these teams what issues these things are going to cause. In fact, it is obvious to some team members, but the problem is that they perhaps haven't created that psychological safety and that vocabulary to be able to talk about it in an objective way and to decide with intent, are we going to solve for this or not? So I do see a lot of those scenarios in our industry, which end up just actually wasting a lot of time. Whereas pre-mortem is a very inexpensive way to see these things because all it is is one meeting followed by some work that the leader needs to do to prioritize, followed by some mitigating actions, which you would've had to take anyway. So that's why I'm a huge fan of pre-mortems is, it's one of those very low downside, but very high upside things that I've experienced.

Lenny (00:33:54):
I'm excited to see those template, I haven't seen yet. I don't know that you put one together, so that's awesome. And we'll link it in the notes of this episode. I want to move to our second big idea, which is about something you've called LNO framework, which is all around prioritizing your finite time as a PM and as a team. And so, I'll just kind of turn that over to you to share what that's all about.

Shreyas Doshi (00:34:15):
Yes. And so, I'm going to share a short personal anecdote related to the LNO framework, which is that when I just joined Google as a relatively new PM, this is back in 2008, for the first three years, I was overwhelmed and stressed. And that was because, one, I was a new PM in this really high performance environment. I was working on some important products and launches and I just had too much to do. And I looked back at that time and it was perhaps the most stressful time of my career, where I would long hours, etc. But even at the end of the day, I'd feel highly dissatisfied because my to-do list was endless and I wasn't able to make a dent on it, and I was also a little bit of a perfectionist, so I was like, "No, no, no, I need to do this well."

(00:35:02):
It was just constantly I would come home and talk to my wife and basically just complained to her about how I'm not able to make progress or as much progress as I want, then that was accompanied with not being able to sleep very well because I was concerned about how much output I was producing and whatnot. And so, again, very stressful time in my career. And then things changed when I discovered the ideas related to this LNO framework in a block post. Unfortunately, I can't even find that block post somewhere, but it had some ideas that I took and then created this LNO framework on myself, which is essentially that as a product manager or as anybody in a creative high impact high leverage role, all your tasks are not created equal, there are actually three type of tasks that you end up doing in such a role.

(00:35:56):
So there are L tasks which are leverage tasks. And the L tasks are such that when you put in a certain amount of effort, you get 10X or 100X in return in terms of impact. So those are L task, leverage tasks. Then there are neutral tasks, so that's N. And those are tasks where you basically get what you put in, or just a little more than that. So you put in 1X and you get 1.1 X, those are neutral tasks. And then there are overhead tasks where, again, in terms of impact, you get back a lot less than you actually put in. And it turns out that many people who are ambitious or are perfectionists like myself by default treat each of these types of tasks the same way, and therein lies the problem. So this was the epiphany for me back at Google when I discovered some of these ideas.

(00:36:47):
And what I realized is that among the things in my to-do list that are actually only very few L tasks, and so, it made sense for me to focus a lot on those L tasks, to take on those L tasks when I was feeling most productive, most energetic during a certain time of the day.And for the L tasks, let my inner perfectionist shine because I'm going to get so much more in return. It makes sense for me to spend that time on that PRD, for instance, related to an important feature that will meaningfully impact our revenue. I'm going to spend more time on that than I ordinarily would. So now, where does that more time come from because it cannot come from just working more hours? Well, it comes from spending less time on N tasks and O tasks. And so, there are some tasks that you do. Classic example of an O task is say an expense report. Sounds silly, but I used to try to make my expense report really good.

(00:37:47):
And sometimes that made no sense like, "No, no, no. I need to do that." And again, this is the silliest example, but there are many examples. And something I realized is that the same type of activity can actually be either an L task or an N task or an O task. So what's an example? So say a classic PM task activity of filing a bug report. And so, many companies have these bug templates, etc., etc. that you use to file a bug report. Well, it turns out that filing a bug report depending on the situation, depending on what type of bug it is can actually be an L task high leverage task, and over there you want to file a very detailed explicit bug report. And in other cases, might actually be an O task where you don't fill out the template that diligently and you don't add 15 screenshots with annotations, instead, you just have one screenshot and you hit submit on the bug report.

(00:38:43):
So that shift. Usually for the same type of activity, we provide the same type of engagement. The last example I'll use to illustrate this is taking notes. It turns out even taking notes, taking notes synthesizing them, and then sharing them can actually be an L task, an N task or an O task, depending on what type of notes they are. So, after I understood this, previously, I would just send all notes. I tried to make them really good, which took a lot of time. But then I realized, well, this is a meeting where, yes, I need to send notes, but again, it's like, it's just standard stuff, I just need to quickly list out. People need to really know is the three action items that came out of the meetings who owns them, that's it.

(00:39:23):
And it is not about something highly strategic or controversial. Well, in that case, I'm just going to send the notes out the moment the meeting is over, I'm just going to hit send because I've already taken the action item. I'm not going to try to make my notes look great so that others can appreciate, "Oh, Shreyas always sends great notes." On the other hand, if it was a product review with the CEO about a very contentious topic that you have gone back and forth multiple times, and now you made a decision about something, you want to perfect those notes before you send them out, you want to get the language right, you want to be very clear on what the decision is, so there's no room for misinterpretation, so you don't backtrack afterwards or people say, "Well, but I thought we'd said this." That's a case where it's an L task. And I would say just spend an hour or even two hours perfecting those notes because it's an L task. So, hopefully that helps illustrate some of the ideas behind the LNO framework.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah. And that last piece is a really good segue to the next big idea around optics and the important optics.

(00:40:25):
This episode is brought to you by Sprigg. If you've been a member of my community for a while, you know my user fan and investor in Sprigg. Sprigg is a user research platform that makes getting user insights from your product as easy and fast as getting analytics. The best product and research teams at companies like Loom, Opendoor and Dropbox use Spriggs in product surveys to target specific users, start collecting insights and identify issues and opportunities related to activation, onboarding, engagement [inaudible 00:40:54]. Talk about a platform that pays for itself. But I'm perhaps most excited about Sprigg's newest launch, which extends the power of the platform pre-launch and makes it possible to test mockups and prototypes with your own users in minutes.

(00:41:06):
The testing interface is super slick and doesn't require any of the typical plugins that make testing with your own users an appealing. And with unlimited seats, you're able to invite anyone from your company to view and use insights generated by Sprigg. If you want to get started, head over to sprigg.com/lenny and mention that I sent.

(00:41:26):
But before we get to that, I wanted to have one follow-up question. What are some classic examples of high leverage tasks that PM should try to do more often and think about? What's in that bucket, generally? Even though you pointed out a lot of times they could be in any of the buckets, depending on how you execute them. Are there things that are just like, you should probably spend a lot of your time doing X, Y, Z?

Shreyas Doshi (00:41:43):
Yeah. So, turns out that the L tasks, PMs implicitly just deep down they know what their L tasks are, because those are the tasks that are bothering them the most because they are not doing them or because they're not doing them as well as they know they should. So, the classic example of this is the case where a PM will say, "I know I need to work on getting our strategy right, but I don't have time because I'm busy firefighting. I'm busy just dealing with all these execution issues. And I just don't have time to work on the strategy piece." Sometimes we console ourselves by saying, "Yeah. That's because we have all these things going on this month, but trust me, next month, we're going to have ample time and I'm going to just spend a whole week working on strategy." Well, the next month rolls around and it's the same thing, you've got other issues.

(00:42:38):
The reason we procrastinate on these tasks are, one, because we know that they're L tasks, we know the impact they'll have, and we are a little scared. That's one. The second is they require dedicated attention. And again, we are afraid about whether we'll have anything interesting to say. That's the deep fear. Why many people procrastinate on strategy? Because deep down, they don't know if they can formulate a good strategy. So time becomes a convenient excuse for us where we say, "Well, it's not me. It's just, I don't have time to work on it." And by the way, everything I say here, I have been that person. So I have been that person who's procrastinated on an L task, whether it's the strategy or whether it's writing the PRD for this really difficult feature, or it is working on aligning two teams where that alignment would create a lot of impact, but it's hard, it's an L task, but I don't do it because I don't want to deal with this other person, this manager I love to collaborate with to make it happen.

(00:43:46):
And perhaps, I don't know if we'll get along. I don't know if I can have that tough conversation. And so again, it's an L task, but I'll try to apply bandaids instead of just tackling it head on. So, this is tough stuff. And what I've found useful there is two things, two tactics make a huge difference in helping us target L tasks better. One is the idea of placebo productivity. So, what I do is before I have to tackle an L task, that couple of days leading up to it, I do all these placebo productivity tasks. Basically, I intentionally do N tasks and O tasks. I fill up my day with N and O tasks.

(00:44:26):
And I keep reminding myself, "Yeah, you're just doing neutral and overhead tasks." Because then that just tricks me into thinking, "Okay, if I've been doing this placebo productivity task for the last two days, now, it's the right time for me to do this L task." So that's one tactic. The other is change of location. Nothing, for me, at least fights my procrastination for L tasks better than changing the place from which I'm working. So if I normally work from this desk, the appointed day I did my couple of days of placebo productivity tasks, and on that appointed day, when I'm slated to do an L task, I will actually go out and work from somewhere else, whether it's a coffee shop or a co-working space or some other space. And I find that change of place just forces a focus and a shift in mindset that helps me bang out that L task very quickly and do it really well.

Lenny (00:45:16):
That are some great advice. There's so many layers of advice in that answer. Your point about the high leverage tasks being the task that you know you should do, but don't want to do, makes me think of a quote that I always come back to that the cave you fear contains the treasure that you seek. And I often find that to be true. And it's this reminder to just wherever the compass is pointing where it's most difficult, it's probably where the biggest opportunity lies. And so, that's a really good reminder of all that.

Shreyas Doshi (00:45:40):
So wise. Yeah, pay attention to your fears because they're telling you something.

Lenny (00:45:44):
Speaking of fears, our third big idea is around the three levels of product work. Basically the three things that a PM should be focused on and how often when you're not aligned on what is most important to you and your team, it often leads to conflict. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack this idea of these three levels of product. We can all share what they are impact, execution and optics. And when I saw this for the first time, I always come back to these three things, because it's so simple and so accurate. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack all this.

Shreyas Doshi (00:46:12):
This idea that there are three levels of product work, impact, execution, and optics. Once you understand it, it explains a lot of what you see on product teams and organizations in general. And so, perhaps start with an example that most product people, product leaders and founders are used to seeing, and something I've seen dozens of times in my career that there's a product review, say, where you as a PM are presenting to the CEO. And as you're presenting what the plan is, obviously since this is a real world product, there's going to be some compromises that you're taking. And so, the CEO perhaps asks about, "Okay, well, why is our customer service response time going to be so high in this case?" And you've thought about it, it's like you did not think about that issue, but that is a good reason why. You talk to the VP of customer support and they don't have the funding this quarter to support your product fully, which will then result in a poor customer service experience for this kind of new product that you're launching.

(00:47:16):
But then you've agreed. You've used your skills of influence to agree that, okay, next quarter, they're going to allocate a lot more people to your product so that the customer service experience will get better next quarter. And so, the CEO asks, "Why is the customer service experience going to be poor here? Or they make a remark like that." And then you reply with all these good reasons. Again, good reasons. And needless to say the rest of the product review doesn't go as well. And after the product review, you wonder what happened. Maybe you ask your manager what happened and particularly you're wondering why couldn't the CEO see a very rational argument about why you can't do this at launch.

Lenny (00:47:57):
Never happened to me. Never happened.

Shreyas Doshi (00:47:58):
And so, it's like, why doesn't he or she see that? And the reason is that you are thinking at different levels. So you as a PM perhaps are fixated as you are dealing with this launch or this project, you are fixated on the execution level, which is what does it take to get something done? And how can I do it? How can I hit the next milestone? Those are all the things we tend to think about when we are thinking at the execution level. The CEO on the other hand is approaching it from the impact level. And particularly perhaps in this case, what is the impact to the customer experience? And often CEOs are the ones, or founders are the ones that are thinking about, what is the impact to our brand? And so the CEO is thinking at the impact level, you're thinking at the execution level, there is that mismatch.

(00:48:46):
We litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we are discussing, but we never really recognize that it's because we are default thinking at different levels. And so, this realization helped me better understand why there were conflicts between two very smart and well intentioned people or groups within a company. I was myself guilty of this as well earlier on in my career, time and again, I noticed that we can, again, keep litigating the specific issue without understanding that, "Oh no, there's actually just a fundamental mismatch." And it's not like people are stuck at one level and can never think at a different level, it's just that we tend to default to certain levels, and that's like sometimes our preferred level. We can switch levels, but that requires a nudge sometimes. And so, that observation helped explain a lot of things, including what kind of people an organization will promote? Does it promote people who default operate at the impact level? Does it promote people more who default operate at the execution level or at the optics level? So, it has very wide ranging impacts on just overall how an organization functions.

Lenny (00:49:59):
What's an example of optics? And when optics matters, when you might not be thinking about the importance of that? Just impacting that one a little bit.

Shreyas Doshi (00:50:06):
Yes. So, optics is about creating awareness of the impact and the execution that you're doing or your team is doing. That is the most compact definition I can come up with for optics. And optics is a good thing. So I'm not saying don't think about optics whatsoever, I think it's actually important to think about optics. And now I'm talking about just internal optics. External optics is an entirely different thing and that's like marketing PR and that's definitely highly important. But even when we talk about simply we limit scope to internal optics, I'll make the observation that you should be spending some time on internal optics because it creates energy, it creates awareness, it creates excitement, it creates opportunities for feedback. Those are all really great things and they will enable greater impact and better execution for you.

(00:50:57):
The challenge with optics is that in certain organizations that balance gets thrown off, where optics sometimes becomes the goal where somehow implicitly the organization or its culture has indicated to it's people that as long as you do the optics well, you are going to be fine, you are going to be appreciated here, you're going to be rewarded here as long as you do the optics fine.

(00:51:22):
And it's not like the organization woke up in the morning and said, 'This is the culture we want to create." It just happens again through little actions that occur every day, it happens through who you hire, who you fire, who you promote and what kinds of things do you appreciate at all hands as the CEO or the founder. Do you appreciate a launch? Do you appreciate results? Do you appreciate, I don't know, an awesome status update that somebody sent? So a status update doesn't on its own accomplish anything. I mean, they are important, but a status update is an optics activity. Now, it is a necessary optics activity, but if you start appreciating the necessary optics activities, constantly, the signal you are sending to people is, 'Oh, you got to focus on this optics activity." So then, that becomes the goal and that can be really harmful.

Lenny (00:52:09):
So there's these three levels of product work. Do you have advice for, should I just default to one of these normally based on just as a PM, I should always be thinking about impact or is it more, just make sure you're aligned with your leader with your team? Is that the more important takeaway?

Shreyas Doshi (00:52:23):
Yes. I think that's the more important takeaway is again, it's about now we have a vocabulary that we can talk about in an objective manner without pointing fingers. It's like, 'Oh, you tend to be fixated on all these execution details and that's not the right thing." That's the type of feedback sometimes that gets shared. So now you have vocabulary to talk about this and once you have that, you can, as a team, decide what is most important given your context. I'll give you an example. For early stage teams, of course, they need to be thinking about the eventual impact, but what they should actually, I think, most early stage teams should actually optimize for execution. Assuming that they have come up with a reasonable hypothesis about what's going to win, their main emphasis needs to be on execution because you will not see impact readily on a one week horizon or a one month horizon or perhaps even on a quarterly horizon.

(00:53:20):
So that's an example of a situation where let's be explicit, we need to get great at execution. We have a set of core insights that were informed by our desire to make an impact. But now that we are responsible for converting these insights into a product, let's be largely operating at the execution level, as an example. Say there is a platform team and that platform team has had some issues lately with availability that has disrupted some other teams within the company and their products. Perhaps that platform team should have a conversation that, 'You know what, yes, we need to focus on impact obviously to avoid this negative impact, but also let's pay some more attention to optics because we haven't been communicating with teams as much teams that rely on us. So let's create a better communication channel with them. Let's create better status updates for them," and whatnot. So again, the point is not so much like, "Oh, this is the right level and all other levels are wrong," it's about being sensitive to what's right in this situation.

Lenny (00:54:21):
So you talked about execution and how maybe for early stage startups that might be default the most important type of work to be focused on. And that's actually a really good lead way to our fourth big idea, which is a provocative tweet that you put out a while ago that you said, "The most execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems." And so, I'm excited to hear a little bit more about how you discovered that and what that means and maybe how to address those problems.

Shreyas Doshi (00:54:49):
And so, I realized this somewhat late in my career as a leader, most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems, they are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems. And so, just to illustrate it, I'll make the observation that many leaders are extremely busy in such environments, whether it's a fast growth startup or a fast growth larger company, they're extremely busy, they're usually overwhelmed. Like I said earlier, I was one of those people. Take a deeper look at what they're engaged in. And I got a chance to look at it with my peers that I was mentoring or coaching or people on my team, PMs or PM leaders were extremely busy and usually overwhelmed.

(00:55:36):
I noticed two things, that what made them busy is two things. One is that somehow the organization had imposed very high optics requirements. So they had to do a lot of optics related work, show up at certain status meetings and blah, blah, blah. So we talked about that. So let's leave that aside. But the other reason they're so overwhelmed is that they're constantly solving execution problems. So they solve the most important ones, the new ones come up and they solve those. And then there are two new ones to solve and on and on, it's a classic guacamole. And as I noticed that, and I'll share a concrete example of where this might happen, where an execution, a seemingly execution problem surfaces, so say two teams are misaligned. They need to work together where they're misaligned. Everybody knows it. And that is affecting our execution. That misalignment is affecting our execution. It's affecting our ability to hit our OKRs, it's affecting their ability to hit their OKRs.

(00:56:32):
So as a leader or say, you are a director of product or VP of product responsible for one of these teams, you now charge with fixing this execution problem so we can move faster. So you do a dozen meetings to figure out what's going on, you try to diagnose the issue, how to better align. And then you talk to your peers on the other side, and then you decide, "Okay, here's what we're going to do to solve this execution problem. We are going to create a new review process." And so, we are going to create this process and we are going to review priorities on a regular basis across these two teams. And then we are going to also as the managers of these individual teams to do regular one-on-ones so they can stay in sync. So this type of scenario is extremely common, again, especially in high growth organizations that want to accomplish a lot.

(00:57:19):
You'll come up with this solution after many meetings and a lot of work, a lot of conversation. And so, as I grew as a leader, I got increasingly curious about this type of situation. And when I looked at it more closely, I started realizing that what looked like an execution problem, this misalignment and this causing execution issues wasn't usually an execution problem. Instead, it was a strategy problem in some cases, because the reason we are misaligned is because we are pursuing different strategies or that is more often the cases, the reason we are misaligned is because we don't know what the strategy is. So, we don't know what the strategy is. We craft some OKRs based on what makes sense. The OKRs are not very well aligned. We don't have a sense of priorities, and we also don't have a sense of what we do when reality changes.

(00:58:09):
This is all stuff that a clear correct strategy should help inform. But actually this lack of strategy is what's causing this misalignment, it's not because they're not meeting regularly. And what happens in these meetings is, again, you're arguing the minutiae of like, "Well, are you going to work on this feature? I depend on this. Or can you swap two engineers from this team?" All of this stuff that PMs are very familiar with. You're talking about all the small stuff, but nobody recognizes that like, "Can we fix that?" So, as I started seeing this often was a strategy problem, sometimes it was not a strategy problem, it was a culture problem. So, what is a culture problem in this situation where two teams are misaligned?

(00:58:49):
It's basically that you have a problem where you have set a culture that you are supposed to mainly optimize for your OKRs. In a culture like that, it becomes really hard to allow two teams to work better together because if one of the teams doesn't hit their OKRs, because they were helping rightly for the sake of the company, they were helping this other team that team's manager is going to get his or her wrist lap at the next performance review.

(00:59:17):
So, that is a culture problem. Now, you can set up the meeting and you can request all the syncs you want between these people, it's not going to solve the culture problem, the execution problem is going to manifest in different ways a month down the road. So that's like an example of a culture problem or it could be an interpersonal problem, and this is actually quite common. It's simply that these two people cannot get along. The two team managers do not get along and they just constantly might be creating friction. And so, as a leader, it is important for you to spot that and then coach them through their differences, coach one or both of them through that so that they can better work together. When you solve that, you won't need that monthly review meeting and all these things and 50 other things, because they're not going to work anyway. So that's just one concrete example of team misalignment, which is often viewed as an execution problem, but is not an execution problem.

Lenny (01:00:10):
Are there signs that tell you where dates are slipping, people are surprised? Of execution problems that you have, are there signs that maybe it's one of these other factors? Or is your experience like it's almost always one of these other things?

Shreyas Doshi (01:00:23):
So there are some problems that are truly execution problems. So, an example of that is say you have infrastructure issues, your infrastructure is just old and it can no longer sustain all the usage that you're getting, that will cause execution problems where you'll move slower or you will have outages or high latencies or whatever the case is. That's an execution problem. Another such example of what is really an execution problem is you have a skills' gap. You have say engineers who are not particularly skilled in a certain technology or a certain type of scale that happen to be working in that area, well that is going to create execution issues or you have a PM who is more of a zero to one person, but now you made them responsible for this scale mature initiative, so that's a skill gap and that can cause execution problems.

(01:01:18):
So, there are very concrete instances where there is a real execution problem. It's just that in high performing organizations that are growing really fast, we ignore the other factors that might be at play. And so, now what tells me if something is seemingly an execution problem but not actually an execution problem, a sure far way of identifying those is when you put on a bandaid and the bandaid falls. So, many organizations that are constantly just solving the same problem over and over again like, "Oh, we can never get along. We can never get these two teams to work together.

(01:01:49):
This team is always slow." And so you put the bandaid, but the bandaid doesn't work. So an organizational memories tend to be surprisingly short. So we forget three months ago we put this bandaid and it's no longer working, we just approach it as, "Oh, let's create a new solution." So voila, there's a new meeting. And so that's where that honesty is important. And memory is important, that no, no, no, this is a bandaid we put, but the problem still exists. So it's probably not an execution issue. I

Lenny (01:02:15):
Love that visual of a bandaid falling off. Okay. So, this it's segue to our fifth and final big idea, maybe the most mind bending of all your ideas that I want to talk about. And it's about prioritization and you make this really interesting point that instead of thinking about the highest ROI work you should be doing, which is how I've always thought about it, how I think most PMs think about prioritization. Your point is you should think about it from a minimizing opportunity cost perspective versus an ROI perspective. And so, I'm excited to hear your take on this and where this idea came from.

Shreyas Doshi (01:02:47):
Yeah. I think I learned this by just observing Patrick at Stripe, particularly over the last couple of years that I was there. And then I encapsulated what I learned and observed in this tweet, which is when you are in a high leverage role, you should stop doing work that simply provides a positive return on investment, ROI. And you should start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost and what drives that is the observation that in a high leverage role, so product management is good example of a high leverage role, founders by definition are in a high leverage role, engineering leaders, design leaders, designers, these are all fairly high leverage roles. And in a high leverage role, there will be hundreds of things that you can do that will provide a positive ROI. And what is positive ROI? It's simply that the value created is greater than the value of your time that essentially will ensure positive ROI more than zero.

(01:03:48):
So, the problem is you should not be doing most of these things. And the reason this ROI mindset is suboptimal and perhaps even harmful in high leverage roles, the formula for ROIs value created minus cost of your time divided by the cost of your time. So, the cost of your time is in the denominator. And just for the sake of simplicity, let's just call it time taken. So when the time taken to do something is in the denominator and whether it's at an individual level or at a team level, what we end up doing to get high ROI on our work is we end up trying to decrease the denominator. So when it's a ratio and you decrease the denominator, the value of the ratio grows. And so, how do you decrease the denominator in this case where time is the denominator is you start working on things that take less time.

(01:04:36):
So you start working on the low hanging fruit. You start prioritizing the quick wins. And the quick wins are very popular. Any team meeting or sprint meeting, "Oh, that's a quick win. Yeah, let's do it." And I don't have anything against quick wins. The problem is we just fill up our plate with quick wins. And while that may be fine, in most cases, in most situations in high leverage roles, you miss the upside and you miss the opportunity that you could have gained by focusing on other things. Let's take opportunity costs now like, how do you calculate opportunity costs? Opportunity cost is simply the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option. So the difference between what could have been the optimal option to pick and the option you did pick is the opportunity cost. So you need to minimize the opportunity cost, meaning you need to be working on the optimal things.

(01:05:27):
So when we reprogram ourselves to think in terms of opportunity cost, we are no longer thinking, "Oh, is this a good use of my time?" Instead, you are thinking, "Is this the best use of my time?" And it's a subtle but profound shift in our thinking. Because when we think about opportunity cost, we will pick certain things that we would've never picked if we just had it the ROI mindset. And again, this applies equally at the level of individuals of the work we decide to do as individuals on a day-to-day basis and the work we do with our teams, the things we prioritize. So that's the basis of this statement that you should try to minimize opportunity costs and focus on those things rather than simply chasing positive ROI.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Is there an example that comes to mind when you did this or maybe did it the wrong way that helped inspire this idea? Or is this just more of a broad lesson that you've learned over time?

Shreyas Doshi (01:06:18):
Oh, I mean, I saw that all the time, the work I did at pretty much every company. And again, I've been guilty of this myself where I think typically the type of situation where I have seen this as an example is you are trying to prioritize the next quarter. There are five sure things you can do that will have small to medium impact, and it's very clear. And then there are two ambiguous things that perhaps deep down you know you should pursue them, but you don't end up picking them because it's, again, you're satisfying yourself by observing, "Oh, each of these is positive ROI. Each of these five things that we can do that are very well defined as positive ROI." And so you don't touch those two things. Now, it could be that one of those things could meaningfully change the trajectory of your business, but doing that requires more work to figure that out, to flesh it out.

(01:07:11):
But we convince ourselves that positive ROI is great. And so we make ourselves busy and this is what I have seen myself do, I've seen other teams do. And certainly when I sit down with PMs often or even founders, I find that there is this gravitation towards these types of tasks, which are simply providing positive ROI. So it shows up most often in our planning, essentially. And again, I'm not against things that are quick wins or things that provide positive ROI, but I always want to check what are some big opportunities that we are not paying attention to by default and under what scenarios can we start chasing that.

(01:07:50):
So when I started working on Stripe Connect, which is a major, major product for Stripe and a large business for Stripe, there was a time when I noticed when I just started working on it, I noticed the team was working on a lot of positive ROI things. And I came in and it just simply instigated that like, "Hey, how about we work on this big scary project? Because I was hearing from customers that there is some need and that the instinct that this need is going to grow over time of being able to manage marketplace payments in a more flexible way." And we wouldn't have looked at it if we were just focused on positive ROI, but as we started looking at it, we realized, "Oh yes, this is a huge opportunity." And we were able to then pursue it because we were of shifting the mindset from just positive ROI to minimizing opportunity cost.

Lenny (01:08:35):
One more question along this line, just tactically, every PM ends up with a spreadsheet of their ideas and ROI and cost and benefit and all that stuff. Do you recommend folks create a column for opportunity cost or is this more of a broad thought process you go through when you're looking through your list of ideas?

Shreyas Doshi (01:08:51):
Yeah, it's more the latter. I do not recommend trying to quantify opportunity costs because it's a lost cost. Instead, what teams need is just sometimes the freedom and sometimes just permission to explore and attack these things that minimize opportunity costs. And so, as leaders, that's the best thing we can do is to give the teams that freedom or the permission to pursue these things and the way it manifests. And the way I've tried to do it is when we are planning, I often give guidance to the team around what percentage of our time we want to spend on what type of activity. And I learned this from Google's classic 70-20-10%, where during its fast growth years, Google had the 70% search and ads, 20% apps, which was things like Gmail and whatnot, and 10% on other big bets.

(01:09:45):
So, I have found that approach very useful during planning. Again, depends on the context, but when the team is starting to plan the next quarter or the next half or the next year, my role as a leader is hopefully I've already clarified the strategy so they have that as an input. But the other thing that I see in my role as a leader is to clarify the rough allocation. So what I'll share as a guidance with the team is given our situation and given our strategy and given what's going on in the market, I would like us to target about 60% of our time on incrementals. And by that, I mean incremental features that improve users' lives on a day-to-day basis. So these are actually high ROI things that we do, and again, these numbers are whatever they are, pick whatever is right for you, but 60% I want to go towards incrementals. 30% I want to allocate towards big new initiatives.

(01:10:43):
And because it's 30%, it can't be five big new initiatives, it's probably one or two. And then 10% I'd like us to allocate towards stability and infrastructure. So this is the guidance I'll share with the team. And then I will ask the teams to create their plans and proposals based on this guidance. So, this gives people the space to say, "Okay, we do have this 30%, so there's no sense putting in more high ROI tasks in there or quick wins in there." And I think just the simple guidance enables the team to just do the right thing. And I often get surprised with all the awesome stuff they come back with.

Lenny (01:11:18):
I really like that rule of thumb, what an excellent nugget to include along with this big idea. I'm realizing we're going for an hour and a half now, and I don't want to suck up all your time. So there's this idea that I think it might be a really good one to end on. It'll be a bonus sixth big idea around high agency and the importance of PMs being high agency. And the reason that it stuck out to me is this, I found to be really important in my career. And I think led a lot of the success that I saw along the way is just always feeling like I have agency and feeling ownership of what I was doing and where I was going. And so, I'm curious to hear your take on this and to dive into this trade of high agency and how important that is for PMs.

Shreyas Doshi (01:11:55):
I think Eric Weinstein coined this term high agency, which once I discovered it resonated a lot and aligned with some of my ideas and the way I had defined this concept in my head for many years, that high agency is about finding a way to get what you want without waiting for conditions to be perfect or otherwise blaming the circumstances. And so, we've all seen such people, they just either push through in the face of adverse conditions or often they manage to reverse the adverse conditions to achieve their goals. And so, while this is an important trait for many areas in endeavors, I think this is particularly important for product managers because as product managers, we are constantly fighting adverse conditions, not enough resources, challenges with legacy infrastructure, staffing issues, customer problems, and on and on. There's no dirt of problems to solve as a product manager.

(01:12:55):
And I noticed consistently over the years that as I started thinking about what differentiates the PMs who've had just a large impact and even more important than just impact to the company or to the team, PMs who've surprised me in a positive way, PMs who've really exceeded expectations, exceeded perhaps their own capabilities on paper. You see somebody's credentials on paper and then you see their work and their impact. And there's a big difference between what you might assume on paper and the impact they're achieving. And also, the reverse of that, which is sometimes you have PMs who just have tremendous potential. They look great on paper and you know when you're working with them or you're managing them that they're not achieving that potential, they're nowhere close to achieving that potential. And as I look at both of those situations, it became clear to me that high agency was a big contributor, which is the PMs in this first category were despite all the disadvantages and other things, they just took strong ownership.

(01:13:56):
So ownership is one component. Ownership mindset is one component of high agency. They took strong ownership and then they creatively executed through the challenges. So a creative execution is another aspect of high agency and they did that with a high degree of resilience, which is a third aspect of high agency. And so, as I realized that it became very clear as to why this was happening. And then it's one of those things that once you see it, you start seeing it in people much more clearly. And so, that's when I wrote about the PM version of high agency, I think that's why it resonated with a lot of people because, again, it gave vocabulary to people for what they already understood and they had seen it, but did not have the words for.

Lenny (01:14:38):
I think that's a really good way to wrap this up, just leaving people at that point of just the empowerment, basically taking responsibility, feeling high agency resiliency. Shreyas, this has been incredibly illuminating. I suspect this is going to be helpful to a lot of product managers and even non-product managers. And so, just two last questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or learn more and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Shreyas Doshi (01:15:00):
Yeah. So follow me on Twitter and just @shreyas. If you don't have a Twitter account, follow me on LinkedIn, you can just find me there Shreyas Doshi. If you really enjoy the tweets and want to see more, then you can super follow me on Twitter. So this is a smaller community that I'm really enjoying of product managers, founders, product people, designers, engineers, etc. where we go much deeper into these types of topics and more. And if you'd like to learn more about my views on various things related to product, super following me perhaps is a great way to do that.

(01:15:36):
And in terms of other things I'm working on, I am going to be launching a course on product sense and product management later this year, so be on the lookout for that, if that's of interest. And then lastly, I think the best help I can ask for from listeners is just if any of these ideas resonated with you, share them with others. And of course, if there are questions, feel free to ask. But I think my mission here is to really help perhaps bring greater clarity on what is going on around us when we are working in teams and working on projects and products. And so, I really like it when people share the ideas, whether it's on Twitter or publicly, or even with others privately. So that is perhaps the best thing you can do, help me in my mission.

Lenny (01:16:22):
Amazing. What a beautiful way to end it. Shreyas, thank you so much for this conversation.

Shreyas Doshi (01:16:27):
Thanks, Lenny. This was a blast. Thanks for having me. It's really a privilege and I am looking forward to another conversation sometime in the future.

Lenny (01:16:35):
10 big ideas by Shreyas Doshi coming up. I'm really excited about that, too. Thank you again.

Shreyas Doshi (01:16:39):
Great. Bye.

Lenny (01:16:41):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You can also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):
Today, I am super excited to bring you a very special episode with Shreyas Doshi, recorded live at the Lenny and Friends Summit in front of 1,000 people in San Francisco. This is Shreyas' second time on the podcast. His first visit is the third most popular episode of all time of this podcast, and I love that Shreyas was game to try this.

(00:20):
In our conversation, Shreyas shares three questions plus a bonus question that he wished he'd asked himself sooner in his career. We talk about why product leaders are so busy, why the job is so frustrating, why it is so central to build good taste, and also why you're probably not listening as well as you should be. This was so much fun, a huge thank you to Shreyas for doing this.

(00:41):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Shreyas Doshi (01:01):
Thanks, Lenny, for having me. This is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04):
I was going to ask, we recorded our first episode, I think two years ago, and I was in a tiny room in my house. I don't know where you were, but it was very not like this. Thoughts on the setup of this episode?

Shreyas Doshi (01:18):
So first, the Lenny Empire keeps growing, which is amazing to see. And second, as I was coming up here, somebody told me this used to be a car dealership, and I actually realized I purchased my car here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34):
What?

Shreyas Doshi (01:36):
So crazy, only in SF.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38):
What kind of car was this? Say more.

Shreyas Doshi (01:40):
It was a Honda CR-V.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42):
Okay, wow. I am told this venue was also used for... Jimi Hendrix performed here, and Aretha Franklin performed here. So it's like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Shreyas.

Shreyas Doshi (01:56):
There we go, that's going up on my Twitter bio soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02):
Okay, so usually, when we talk, you're full of ideas and you're full of answers. When we were preparing for this, you told me, "I have questions, I have questions I want to ask."

Shreyas Doshi (02:16):
You know, reflecting on my career as a PM leader over the years, there are some questions I wish I had asked myself sooner, but I did not, and I had the great luck of having a life, a PM life full of suffering, and I have zero complaints about it. But as I look back, I feel like there are some questions that even if I asked myself some questions, those questions, I wasn't honest to myself about the answers. So that's what I thought I'd do, is share the questions that I wish I'd asked myself sooner.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:05):
Awesome.

Shreyas Doshi (03:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:06):
Love that, okay. This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like, Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(03:41):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features, like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(04:29):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native, customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Are native integrations on your product roadmap? Whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today.

(04:50):
But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Coffee AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their Pro and Enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(05:37):
What's the first question?

Shreyas Doshi (05:39):
Right, so let's see, the first question is why am I so busy? Why am I so busy? And the background is that I have spent most of my career just being completely stressed out, just absolutely stressed out every day. And there were many reasons for it, but one of the core reasons was I was always super busy, and there was always work I felt like I couldn't do that I wanted to do, and so I would go home at the end of the day, and even if I had worked hard, I'd just feel dissatisfied.

(06:27):
And so that was a constant fixture of my life as a PM, PM leader, and it's only... So I did product work for about 20 years before I started this new chapter of my career. And I think I only fixed it in the last three or four years of my career as a PM leader. But that means that there were about 16 or 17 years where I was just incredibly busy, and because I was incredibly busy, I was extremely stressed, and even though I was doing a good job, I was not feeling very good inside. And then, that showed up in my body, like all sorts of pains and aches I realized were actually not physical pains and aches. They were pains and aches from the stress.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:15):
It's like health issues that you had?

Shreyas Doshi (07:16):
Yeah, yeah, minor stuff. I mean, relatively minor stuff, but playing tennis, and you pull your back muscle, and now you are horizontal for three days, doesn't feel good.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:31):
Who here is very, very busy, and is just way too busy? Raise your hand.

Shreyas Doshi (07:36):
That's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (07:36):
Yeah, I know.

Shreyas Doshi (07:37):
Whoa.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:39):
Everyone's like [inaudible 00:07:39] everybody. Yeah, people were like, "Yeah, yeah. I don't have to raise my hand, I'm busy." Yeah. Okay, keep going.

Shreyas Doshi (07:50):
Yeah, and so here's the thing, when we talk about being busy, and managing your time, energy, all of that, I mean, this is a group of senior product people, so you all know that. Take tips and techniques, like maintain a to-do list. I found the LNO framework very useful for me, which I've shared before. I used to like working out of a calendar, those types of things. And I think you're all familiar with those things, but what I wanted to call out is that, at some point in our product career, we reach something, we reach an immovable force that will just overwhelm us, no matter what we do.

(08:39):
And that force is a scope. Okay, so as we grow in our product career, our scope grows, and we kind of like that, which is all great, but at some point, if you haven't already gotten there, many of you have, but for those of you who haven't, you will get there, where your scope will be so large, that no matter what you do in terms of efficiency, whatever framework you use for prioritization, whatever framework or tool you use to manage your to-do list, whatever tools and techniques you use, whatever prioritization you do, your scope is so large that you are still going to be incredibly busy.

(09:21):
And so that's what I faced, like I was saying for the first about 16, 17 years of working on products, and only in the last 3 or 4 years was I able to kind of find some answers on how to deal with that scope. And so perhaps we can talk about that, what do you think?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:43):
Yeah, so you're basically saying there's all these productivity tricks, ways to do more faster. And no matter how many of these tools you've got, you are just going to take on more and more work, and they'll peter out? I'll say many of my most popular newsletters posts are, "Here's productivity tricks and tips." And so people are always looking for these. And I'm curious to hear where you go with this, of just like that is not the answer long term, there's a different approach?

Shreyas Doshi (10:08):
Yes, and so the challenge is the following. How many of you are going through some kind of annual planning right now or you're planning on going through annual planning? Please. Everybody loves annual planning, great. So let's take annual planning. If you are a high-level manager, leader within a company, what does your month look like? Or in some cases, unfortunately, what do your two or three months look like when you are going through annual planning? It's all these kind of spreadsheets to fill out, and meetings to have, and dependencies, and priorities, and stakeholders to meet, and so on. And so I noticed, for instance, that at some point, that was making me really busy, and then that was making me feel guilty now, because I had my team to look after and to support, and then I had product decisions to make and various other things, and I've gone on some planning retreat or whatever.

(11:15):
And there you go, you last four, five, six, weeks, does that sound familiar to folks? Yeah? Okay, so I noticed that I needed to change that at some point, and actually found a solution, again, late in my career, but I found a solution, because I asked myself this question, which is, "Why am I so busy? I'm doing all the efficiency things, I'm managing my to-do list like a champ. I have my calendar set up just right. I have my routine set up just right. I'm working out so that I'm engaged at work, I'm productive, I'm doing all of that. Why am I so busy? Oh, it's planning season, and that is supposed to take up four to six weeks." And this was at Stripe when I encountered this. So that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.

(12:03):
Well, I realized that you don't have to do that. And so at some point in my time at Stripe, what I realized is the following, we go through a whole all sorts of just rituals around planning for four to six weeks. Then, we emerge and we share our plan with our executives. You know the questions they're going to ask, like, "If money were no concern, what would you do? What is your ambitious plan? So if we gave you five more engineers, what would you do? What other things would you include in the roadmap?" Right? The standard stuff. And so you emerge, you do your presentation, and then you publish the plan, and then you start the new year with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement. And January goes fine, until you get three customer escalations for features that were not in your plan. And so now, you try to figure out how you're going to revise resources.

(13:03):
You go talk to some dependency team that's going to sort of support these new features from these customer escalations. And you go through that process, and you revise your plan again. And then, usually by the time it's last week of February, everybody's forgotten the actual plan. And now, we are executing off of some other list somewhere. And by the way, when you mention this at times, politely of course, you might mention like, "You know, I'm noticing we are not actually really using the plan that we spent four to six weeks minimum doing." And then, some smart person in the room chimes in with, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything."

(13:52):
I don't know, Eisenhower, somebody else, I don't know who said this, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything." Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what that means, but everybody appreciates, "Ah, plans are useless, but planning is everything." Right? So I went through a few years of this. And then I go, "You know what? I'm going to bend some rules here." And so what I realized, Lenny, is you don't have to go through these four to six weeks, and it was an accident. Basically, what happened is around that time, the product I was working on, Stripe Connect, it's like a major product for Stripe, major, major business for Stripe. And I had put together a product strategy, like a real product strategy for this product.

(14:44):
And so this must have been earlier in the year. And so now, planning season came along. And the interesting I found is that because I had a real product strategy, not one of those fake ones, a real product strategy that I had gotten alignment on with everybody, my planning for this major product for Stripe took me like three days. Right, so while a lot of my peers, unfortunately, for their own products, were in this four-to-six week cycle of planning, and meeting, and blah, blah, blah, I just put it all together in three days, and whatever artifacts were needed, I put them together.

(15:27):
I did not fill out some templates. That's where it's about bending the rules, because if a template doesn't make sense, why should I fill it out? There's no need to fill it out. And so that's when I realized that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away. Now, you still have to do some resource allocation and all of that, but even there, you don't need that false precision. How many of you have gotten into arguments about, "So should it be eight engineers for this team in 2025, or nine engineers for this team in 2025?"

(16:11):
Like, who cares? We all know that even those numbers that we set up, we don't actually follow through on them, as 2025 happens. So that's just an example of where we spend a lot of time on things that we think are strategic, that we think are important, but actually, we ought to spend that time on other much higher leverage things. Right, now it does require some upfront work, in this case upfront work on a clear product strategy that everybody understands, that everybody's aligned on. But frankly, if you have that, planning should be a breeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:49):
So what would be your kind of tactical tip for folks that want to do this better? I know there's probably a billion examples of these sorts of things you shared, so planning is an example. Folks that want to be less busy, maybe on that one is it give yourself very little time, and focus on strategy, and let that be the plan, basically, versus every single person and their roadmap for the next six months. What's the piece of advice you'd share there? And then, I want to move on to the next question, because I want to make sure we get through all these questions.

Shreyas Doshi (17:18):
Yes, there's definitely a specific tip, which is if you do have a strategy that will make a lot of your prioritization problems go away, it will make a lot of planning problems go away. And even if you do have some escalation from sales, which you will, or from support, or somewhere else, you now have at least a more rigorous framework to figure out what to do with that escalation. So there's definitely that.

(17:48):
But I think other thing I want to share is that, and this was my other realization as I asked the question, "Why am I so busy?" is I realized that I am so busy because I'm not making good product decisions. Okay, now, you have to understand, by this time I'm like 15 years into building products and whatever, 11 years into being a product manager. And so I think I'm pretty good. That's my kind of self-image. But then, again, if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not making as good product decisions as I can. So can I share an example of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (18:32):
Please.

Shreyas Doshi (18:34):
So what I noticed is that you have a meeting about some product feature that somehow is requested or is really important, whatever the case might be. And so you have a meeting with some stakeholders and your engineering team, designers, et cetera. And then, you're trying to decide, "Should we build this or not?" And somebody says, "You know what? Why are we doing a meeting for this?" I read somewhere or I heard Bezos say that two-way doors, it's a two-way door. You quickly make a decision. Like, just quickly make a decision and move on. This is a two-way door. And so you say, "Yeah, that's right." And any time we hear something like that, two-way door, you're like, "Oh, that person's really smart, so I want to be like them."

(19:32):
So I noticed that myself and my team, we were making these kinds of decisions without very clearly thinking through customer motivation, very clearly thinking through differentiation, very clearly thinking through a distribution approach for whatever this feature is. And while it sounds like, "Oh, of course you should be doing this," I guarantee you this is not how most product teams work. They're talking about, "Well, is Bob the engineer going to be free? And when are they free? And if they are free, then let's build the feature." That's kind of how a lot of product decisions happen.

(20:11):
The challenge here with this kind of approach, and again, this is what happens in practice, I'm not talking about whatever theory you read, this is what happens in practice. So when you follow this approach and you assume that, "Oh, this is a two-way door, we can kill the feature," in reality, it doesn't work out that way, because here's what happens in reality. So in reality, you commit to the feature, and it's going to take five, six weeks to do it, and then a couple more weeks to make sure, to ramp it up, et cetera, right? And so now the feature is out, and now you have your Q1 QBR, right? Say two months from now you have your Q1 QBR, and you're going to present your business review, whatever. You're going to present what you did, "What did you do last quarter? How are your ships performing from last quarter?"

(21:03):
And so now, it's time to talk about this feature at the QBR, because you have to share that/ Now as you start talking about this feature, the CEO will ask, "So yeah, we launched the feature. I'm very glad we launched this feature. How is it doing?" And you want to be able to say, you are the PM leader, you want to be able to say something smart, and something that makes you look competent. But the challenge is the feature hasn't had much adoption. So I'm not going to ask anybody to raise hands, but I think most PMs are familiar with this conundrum. And of course, we are verbally very agile as product leaders. So what we say is we don't have data, so we use favorable anecdotes.

(21:53):
And so we say, "Yeah, we launched the feature, and you know what? This customer from this company really loves the feature." And we put in an anecdote, it's like, "Life-changing feature." It doesn't matter that they're the only person using it. That doesn't matter. "Life-changing feature," right? We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us. So anyway, so we present that. Now. we do have the sales counterpart in the room too, our sales counterpart, and they say, "You know what, though? We are still not winning many deals because of this feature." And so of course the CEO asks, "So what's up? Why aren't we winning deals, even though we have the feature?"

(22:30):
So the people on the customer side usually we respond, "Well, I'm glad we have the feature, but it's not full featured yet. We need all these other bells and whistles to meet the table stakes." So now, what happens? Somebody uttered the word, "Meet the table stakes." Now, it's over for you, because now, the only response you can give is, "Oh, yeah, that's already part of the plan." And now, you put your engineering leader on the spot and you say, "Alice, isn't it? Haven't we allocated engineers to it already?" And so now, Alice has to come up with some response, which is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carol and David are going to work on it. It's slotted for one of these sprints."

(23:19):
And so now, you exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, "Good job, team, great job," et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature. So I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy.

Lenny Rachitsky (24:18):

(25:21):
I know it's Spotify, I heard one of their core values is, "Talk is cheap," but it's the virtue version of that. It's like, they actually prefer to talk more, and I think that's exactly what you're saying. Basically, spend more time on these things that seemingly seem just small little ideas and experiments.

Shreyas Doshi (25:37):
Yep, thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:41):
Amazing. Shreyas, what's your second question?

Shreyas Doshi (25:45):
Yes. So my second question, I have to get the words right, do I actually have good taste? Do I actually have good taste is my second question. And for me, I asked this question after, again, all of these things... By the way, everything I say, I have been that guy, I've made that mistake. So that's why I just have to admit to myself that, yes, I have made these mistakes. And one of the mistakes I made, this was when I was at Google, and I was relatively new to product, about less than five years. And at Google, there's some parts of Google where you would be told as an early career PM that like, "We don't do strategy here. Strategy is for MBAs, okay? We are all about execution, okay?"

(26:47):
So I'm in this environment, I'm naïve, and I look around me and I'm like, "Google is the most successful company on the planet," at the time, and they are saying this, and I'm hearing this consistently, so it must be right. It must be right. And so I start saying it. I start saying, "Oh, yeah, execution is everything, and we don't do strategy around here." And I even remember there were not that many PMs, but there was a PM at Google who was kind of like the same level as me, but he just had much more wisdom than me. And he was trying to nudge me into... Like, I was managing a product. And he's like, "Shreyas, what is your strategy here?" And I was like, I told him the same thing. Like, "Oh, no, no, what are you talking strategy? We don't need strategy. We just need to get shit done." That was the thing.

(27:42):
And so I kept repeating that mantra until I got to Twitter. So this is Twitter right after their IPO. And I saw Twitter had an incredible asset, which is the product and the network effects. It had other incredible assets, including the brand. It had other assets that were great, including the talent. And yet, this company was struggling, the product was struggling. And even if it wasn't struggling, it was making a lot of money. But the point is it was not meeting its potential. So that's when I realized, and it wasn't like some sudden realization, it took me six to nine months of being at Twitter. This is circa 2014. That's when I realized that, "Oh, my gosh, Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy."

(28:38):
Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. So that's when I realized the folly of like, "Oh, wait a minute..." I was at Google six years. I spent most of those six years saying like, "Ah, strategy's useless. There's no point to strategy. Execution is where it's at. "I'm like, "No, actually, I was wrong." And that got further solidified as I went to Stripe, and I was kind of now growing earlier stage products and trying to make them highly, highly successful. I saw an even greater value and importance of having a clear strategy. And so that made me realize, basically...

(29:29):
You know, we talk about taste, we all talk about taste, and it's about the beautiful pixels, and the perfect product, and the whatever else, the Steve Jobs-esque passion, and all of that, whatever it is. And yes, taste is about that, but I think there is something that we as product leaders, and certainly I did, needed to recognize about taste as just a factor in pretty much everything we do, which is like, do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders? And then, those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions. And so it's that taste I'm talking about when I say, "Do I really have good taste?"

(30:28):
And when I asked myself this question, and again, I really had to dig deep. It wasn't easy, but at some point I realized that no, actually, I don't have good taste. I don't have good taste in how I choose to evaluate things that come my way. Again, not in terms of the product, because by that time I had skills to say, "Well, this should not be a two-step flow. This should be a three-step flow," whatever the case may be. But I still did not have good taste in terms of how I choose what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learned from, what content I resonate with? And then, I went on this journey to try to develop that better taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:21):
What I'm hearing is people focus maybe too much on the output, like the experience, these experience design taste versus what they choose to take in as informing their taste, and what they see as an example of great and correct. Is that what you're saying?

Shreyas Doshi (31:37):
Yeah. And look, taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results, because, look, it requires zero taste right now for anybody to say, "Oh, that CEO of NVIDIA is a genius, right? Jensen is a genius." If you are saying that in 2024, it actually requires zero taste, because you can just look up NVIDIA stock price. It requires zero skill. But to be able to say that in 2010, you have to realize Jensen Huang didn't change much between 2010 and 2024. So Lenny, even in sports, there's this saying, "Game recognize game," and that's about taste.

(32:59):
But what we need to understand is it's game recognize game before the game is called, right? Like, game recognize game in the practice session. Because it takes no genius right now to say, "Well, Patrick Mahomes is great quarterback," or, "Virat Kohli is a great cricketer," or whatever else. It requires no genius to do that. It requires zero taste. So I also believe some of us, especially as we get more senior, and we get more successful, and we just get a lot more scope, and responsibility, and a lot of accolades, we become these tough graders. Like, "I don't like anything," right? Like, "Ah, this is crap, this is crap, this is crap." Again, that requires zero taste. Anybody can say that. Anybody can just say, "Everything is horrible."

(33:53):
So I do think there is something about being able to understand that, and I think I'll share some examples. This two-way door thing, so let me just share a few observations, if I might. So the first one is we get overly excited about cool metaphors, okay? Like, one-way door, two-way doors. There's some guy, I don't know who it is, I just read somewhere, there's some guy who had written a blog post about this idea, but he called it reversible and irreversible decisions, and it was the same idea. And I think somebody was lamenting that that did not catch on, reversible and irreversible decisions. But what caught on is two-way door and one-way door. What's the difference? The only difference is you got attracted to the catchy metaphor, and the other one is the authority bias, because Bezos said it.

(34:58):
Take another example, we get very impressed with alliterations. I'm serious, we get very impressed with alliterations. Okay, so how many of us love fail fast? Fail fast, okay, nobody's going to raise hands now. Okay, fine. Maybe you truly don't love fail fast. How about fast follow? How many of you love fast follow? Let's consider that, like fail fast, "We're going to fail fast." What if that thing were called fail quickly? It's the same meaning. Do you think you would be as attracted to that idea if it were called fail quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (35:44):
No.

Shreyas Doshi (35:46):
Probably not, so what changed? The only thing that changed is one is an alliteration. So I see this in everything. Like, let's see, the other one is we also get very impressed with complicated charts and math we don't understand. And some of you product leaders who are at the top of the game, you actually use this as a strategy. So as I realized that here's the outcome of that, asking myself that question, was that what I realized is everybody says, "Oh, I'm a first principle thinker. I am a rigorous thinker," whatever.

(36:41):
But I realized that if I really want to be that, I have to shed a lot of these just patterns that were just built in me, and I kind of have to evaluate the idea separate from all of its social proof, and authority proof, and whatever else. And that ended up being a meaningful change in my growth as a product leader, because the moment I started shedding these kinds of social proofs, and authority proofs, and all of that, it just made me a much... We all again think we are critical thinkers, but we are not, right? So it made me a more critical thinker.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:31):
I want to move on to the next question, just so we can get through some of these questions. Before I do, can you just show people your notes real quick, just like show it from a distance? This is how Shreyas plans for something like this. There's color coding, I wish I understood what was going on there.

Shreyas Doshi (37:49):
People ask me, "What's your favorite note-taking app?" It's a common question I get, and I say this, right? It's a $5... Like I guess the pen costs $3, and I think the Office Depot clipboard costs-

Lenny Rachitsky (38:00):
Wait, doesn't that pen... Does it have the different color clicky thing?

Shreyas Doshi (38:02):
Yes, yes, yeah. A [inaudible 00:38:04]. Yeah, exactly. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:06):
That's going to be another podcast episode. Okay, so we want to try to do two more questions. We have six minutes left. The last one's a bonus, so maybe we touch on it briefly. Shreyas, what's your third question?

Shreyas Doshi (38:18):
So my third question is why does my job feel so frustrating? Why does my job feel so frustrating? And it goes back to the point that, look, I loved, loved my PM leadership job. I just absolutely loved it. And I think looking back, I would not have exchanged it for anything else, any other experience. That said, there were daily frustrations. There were daily frustrations in that job, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely. The PM's job, the PM's on your team, their job is also lonely. But a PM leader's job is further lonelier. So there's that. There's also what I learned at the time when I started asking this question is that our jobs get frustrating when we behave, most of the time, in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core.

(39:32):
Okay, so for me, as I was evaluating that question, it's like, "Why am I getting frustrated every day? I love the job, I love the macro, but I do not like the micro. And so why is that?" And that's when I actually... There's a simple framework that I've shared, which is you can be doing your work at three levels. Product work happens at three levels. There's the impact level, there's the execution level, and there's the optics level. My epiphany as I was exploring this question was I have a preferred level at which I like to operate, but if most of the day, and most of the week, and most of the month, I am forcing myself to operate in not my happy place, in my non-default level, that makes me very frustrated.

(40:33):
So many product leaders, their happy place is the execution level. In my case, my happy place is the impact level. So that is fine. Your happy place can be whatever level, it doesn't matter. But the point is, as you go higher up in the corporate ladder, no matter what kind of company it is, you are now going to have to spend a lot of time on optics, at the optics level. And I have willpower, I have the skills to do it, I have all of that. So it's not about willpower or skills, but willpower is finite. So as I spent day in and day out, just mostly doing optics work, I realized I was not happy and I was getting frustrated. And so that's when I realized the solution, which is I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, "Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects. This is what my mom expects. What will people say on LinkedIn when they see my LinkedIn profile?" Like, "Oh, he has this progression, this, and then what stopped? Why did it stop?"

(41:49):
So when I realized this, I said, when a team grew to a certain size, so when I was at Stripe and I realized this, when the team I was managing, it had a fan out of about 50 people, so this includes engineers and everything, I said, "This is enough." Because for me, any time a team goes to like 50s, and 100s, and beyond, it is a law of corporations that you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the optics level. So instead of just pushing, pushing through against who I truly am, what did I do? I just went back to more of an earlier stage product, and then I was fine with like, "You know what? I'm not going to just play the corporate game," as an example.

(42:34):
So I guess my suggestion would be identify your superpowers, and like Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true." Just be honest to yourself. Operate your career and make your career decisions not out of expectation, not out of envy, like the LinkedIn envy of like, "Oh, this person is at a different level. We both went to the same grad school, so I got..." No, identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life. You will love it, and you will be great at it, and you won't have that frustration.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:23):
I wish we had an hour for every single one of these questions, I feel like there's so much more to get into. We have 40 seconds. Do you want to touch on your last question or do you want to leave that for a follow-up discussion?

Shreyas Doshi (43:35):
Let's touch on it, let's touch on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:37):
Okay, we got to go though in 30 seconds.

Shreyas Doshi (43:38):
All right. My last question is am I really listening? Okay, and this is perhaps the hardest one for me, because I thought, of course I'm a good listener because I listen, then I recap, and I make eye contact, and I tell them, "This is what I heard," And all of that nonsense. I realized there is an entirely other level to listening, which once you understand that there's an entirely other level to listening, that is what enables you to be a world-class leader. And so that is what I guess my last takeaway is, is ask yourself, "Am I really listening?" If you want resources, there are very few people who actually talk about what that real listening means. I would refer you to what Rick Rubin says about listening, I would refer you to what [inaudible 00:44:30] said about listening, and what Drucker said about listening as some pointers.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:36):
Amazing. Shreyas, you said you were going to hang out for the next hour somewhere. You want to share that real quick, and then we'll get off?

Shreyas Doshi (44:42):
Yes, I will maybe try to hang out in the back part of the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:46):
Be quiet back there, too.

Shreyas Doshi (44:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:47):
Shreyas, thank you so much for being here.

Shreyas Doshi (44:50):
Great, thank you. Oh, should we take a picture?

Lenny Rachitsky (44:54):
Oh, yeah. We're going to take a quick selfie.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
We're going to take a picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:59):
There we go. They're going to turn lights on, I think.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:00):
Okay.

Shreyas Doshi (45:03):
All right, folks.

# Product lessons from Waymo | Shweta Shrivastava (Waymo, Amazon, Cisco)

## Transcript

Shweta Shrivastava (00:00):
Are you proactively trying to challenge your own assumptions is extremely important, right? As a big enough product manager as well as a seasoned product leader, if you're not doing enough of that, then I think you might not be listening. If there's no conflict, if there's no contention, then something is missing.
Lenny (00:20):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Shweta Shrivastava. Shweta is senior director of product management at Waymo, which if you're not familiar with Waymo, they're building self-driving cars that already live on the streets in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix. I actually got to take a ride in one ahead of this chat and you'll hear all about that in this episode.
(00:48):
Before joining Waymo, was chief product officer at Nauto and AI started focusing on driver automation safety. Before that, she was head of product management at Amazon Web Services for their database and analytics services, and before that she was at Cisco. In our conversation, we delve into what it's like to work as a PM at Waymo and how it's both different and similar to software only products.
(01:09):
We talk about their KPIs and goals at Waymo, including how they track progress towards a future of self-driving cars, how they build subtle cues and behaviors into the cars to create trust for the rider and also for other cars on the road. Plus Shweta's biggest lessons about building products and teams across the many companies she's worked at. I can't wait for the future of every car being self-driving, and it was super fun to learn about what goes into making this all happen. With that, I bring you Shweta Shrivastava after a short word from our sponsors.
(01:40):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Com, Quora and Modern Treasury Trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and many more.
(02:07):
Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders. Over 5,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2 and these other frameworks. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(02:38):
This episode is brought to you by public.com. We want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasury yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account.
(03:09):
You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.
(03:47):
Shweta, welcome to the podcast.
Shweta Shrivastava (03:49):
Thank you. Great to be here.
Lenny (03:52):
It's great to have you. I thought we'd start with just a little bit about what it is you do at Waymo today. What are you and your team's responsible for at Waymo?
Shweta Shrivastava (04:02):
Yes, my team's responsible for three key areas, I would say. One is building a big part of the software that actually runs on board the fully autonomous vehicle and that determines the actual behavior and trajectory of the vehicle. Secondly, building the simulation tools and technologies that are required to validate the performance of the system. And then, a third one of the teams focused on commercially scaling our ride-hailing business, which is one of our key go-to market applications for the technology we're building.
Lenny (04:34):
So as you know, I arranged a ride for me in a Waymo in San Francisco. It was actually a really rainy day and it was quite mind blowing. I've never been in a self-driving car that had no driver sitting in the front. I have a Tesla and I turn on self-driving sometimes, but I've never experienced just sitting in the back and this thing just raises you around. Also, just like a memory hat is the app to call the Waymo, it feels like Google Maps except instead of just telling you how to get to a place like a car shows up and just takes you there and then you could change course as you're driving and it's crazy how quickly it became normal.
(05:08):
I'm just like, all right, we're just riding around San Francisco in this self-driving car and just sitting in the back and telling you where to go. And so anyway, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions around this, but I guess thank you for arranging that ride. It was quite special.
Shweta Shrivastava (05:21):
No, I'm glad that you were able to do that on a rainy day. So that's a special bonus because, again, the technology has been performing very well, which has been very heartening for us to see.
Lenny (05:30):
A few questions along these lines, one thing that I noticed that was really cool is we're trying to turn into a lane and there's cars coming in that lane just continuing to move and the car just kind of subtly was inching its way out, communicating through this interesting body language thing of just like, can someone let me in? And it's interesting, there's no eye contact involved and it's just like this, I don't know, gesture that you all have to develop.
(05:54):
And so, I guess, the question here is just like what have you all learned? And I don't know if you even work on that piece of it, but just, I'm curious how you think about creating this body language of the car communication system to help people understand what it's trying to do.
Shweta Shrivastava (06:07):
We're using a lot of human driving data to train our deep models. So it's important to make sure that the behavior of the car doesn't seem robotic, it can feel quite unnatural. And from the get-go, we focused on building a fully autonomous system. So it's important to have that familiarity, that trust, building with the riders where they're not daunted by technology, they don't feel like they're sitting in our walk. It has to feel very human-like, but in a good way. Making it safer than human driving, but then not making it feel unnatural.
(06:40):
And so we have deep learned models that can understand what the other road users' intent is. So, stuff like which way the pedestrian is looking or what is their body orientation because that could tell you which way they're headed. The road signs or the gestures, somebody is trying to stop the vehicle. The system can understand all those signals.
(07:04):
So because we're using deep learn models trained on human driving, but again sort of in a good way. We discard the bad human driving data. We can mimic human driving behavior in a good way and that's why you saw the behavior that you saw yesterday. Now, one thing to note is we can't also just completely rely on explicit gestures and signs because a lot of driving has also social norms. If you're in a pretty clear section in San Francisco, maybe it's okay for pedestrians to cross even when they don't have a walk sign.
(07:43):
Another city, another intersection might have a different social norm when it comes to pedestrians crossing the four-way stop sign or the crosswalk or what have you. And so, the car also has to learn about those social norms and be able to react to it. So, like I said, we don't realize how sophisticated, how interactive and how social driving really is. And with our artificial intelligence capabilities, we have been able to incorporate a lot of that into our system behavior.
Lenny (08:14):
So before Waymo, you worked at non self-driving software companies, you worked at Amazon, Cisco, a few other companies. I'm curious what you've found to be the biggest difference working in a company like Waymo versus a traditional software company.
Shweta Shrivastava (08:29):
As I said earlier, it's a highly complex, technically complex, system that we have built and we're improving. And if I may say, it's the most game changing product that anybody would ever work on.
Lenny (08:43):
I don't know, Amazon's pretty cool, but I totally get you.
Shweta Shrivastava (08:46):
I worked at Amazon, I'm a fan. And they have been pretty transformational with AWS and on the eCommerce side. But a fully autonomous driving system, it's also a very, very hard problem. So it's transformational from that perspective too. I would say that the PMC has to be able to go technically indeed, compared to what they would do in other software products. They have to be able to get into the details as much as needed. They have to be okay with uncertainty and ambiguity.
(09:24):
Again, I think, that is part and parcel of any product management role, but it's even more so here. This is a long game and so you have to have the tenacity to play the long game and be continuously improving the product and make this thing a broad reality and future. So, those are some of the attributes. I would also say that there is some level of self selection here. You have to be driven by the mission to make the roads safer. We have about 1.35 million debts that happen every year across the world from traffic accidents and most of that is attributable to driving errors and driver distraction.
(10:04):
I've been guilty of checking my text messages while driving. I've seen other drivers do that. But a fully autonomous technology, you don't have that risk. That's the risk we're trying to minimize. So they have to be driven by that mission. One other thing is that the concept of MVP, which is so widely popular in the SaaS product management world or product management world, in general, has a whole new meaning here at Waymo when you work in a product like this because safety is on top of mind for all of us and can't really cut corners on safety.
(10:42):
The MVP bar itself for safety is extremely high for us. So, the core product management philosophy also, getting an MVP out there and then iterating with the real world deployment. It applies, but it's just a different bar on that MVP.
Lenny (11:03):
Touching again on safety and human behavior, I was thinking a little bit as we're chatting about, say of Tesla, which has self-driving car, self-driving capabilities and intellectually I know it's probably going to drive a lot better than I am, but I still feel like I need to disengage it occasionally when I'm on a curvy road. I'm just like, I don't know about this, I don't want to leave room for error if there's something that weird that happens.
(11:30):
And I imagine someone designing product for that weird behavior where I should probably trust it because it's probably a lot better driver than I am, but I don't know, I feel like I can do a better job. Is there anything you've learned about, I don't know, human behavior or how to design software for these sorts of experiences that maybe surprised you or thought was really interesting or that was really important?
Shweta Shrivastava (11:51):
Since you mentioned Tesla, I just want to clarify that it's a different system that we are building, which is for Waymo, we started by solving the problem of fully autonomous driving without a human driver at the wheel from the get-go. It's not a driver assist or aid system which relies on the human driver taking over when there's a complex situation. So I think that expectation is built into that kind of a product and so the human folks who are using that product will also have that mindset that, hey, I should be ready to take over when the situation demands because we've built the system from the get-go to work in a fully autonomous mode without a human driver intervention at the wheel.
(12:38):
We had to integrate this into our design philosophy from the very beginning that this has to feel credible, predictable and the writers have to be able to trust the system. So that has been sort of the core of the design philosophy. And so, what happens is, and I heard this from you as well, which resonated with me and I've heard this from a lot of our writers, that for the first five minutes of the ride it's, wow, is this thing really happening.
(13:10):
But then it starts to feel very natural and as if this is how it was always meant to be. After the first five minutes, this is like uneventful. That's exactly how it's supposed to feel, but it's not a happenstance that it feels that way. The naturalness, the smoothness and still adhering to safety at all times are things that are designed into the system. And then we make sure that the rider has visibility into what's happening. If they're not wearing the seatbelt, the rider support would call them. So then they know, okay, there's a human that they can reach out to if they have an issue. They can look at the monitor in the car to understand what the car is seeing. So I think all these little things help develop that trust in the system.
Lenny (13:57):
On that same note, what's one thing that your teams have built that creates a lot of trust or maybe it was a surprisingly important element in creating trust in the experience in terms of the product, especially in, I don't know, either the app or in car experience.
Shweta Shrivastava (14:14):
I don't know if I can point to one thing. Again, this is such a holistic experience that I think it has to be a bunch of small things to make it feel natural, transparent and trustworthy to the writers. And I can give you one example that I don't think I've mentioned in the discussion so far. So, again, because the system is designed to be cautious and defensive but still making adequate progress in the absence of traffic, it will never go above the speed limit. It doesn't go above the speed limit. It sticks or adheres to the speed limit or something that a lot of our riders actually appreciate about the system.
(14:55):
Now, it turns out that adhering to the speed limit even without traffic sometimes is not the best thing. You have to go below the speed limit and we realize that for driving in the slopes or the gradients, in clients in San Francisco, there are many of those. The human brain is trained to, or the human drivers are sort of in subconsciously, they slow down when they go downhill in those slopes. The autonomous vehicle doesn't necessarily have to do that if it's safe and if it's staying below the speed limit.
(15:31):
But we learned that this is a more natural driving experience and this is what our riders would also expect in terms of the experience. So that's something that we then modify the behavior on.
Lenny (15:45):
That makes sense. I would want it to slow down. On the other hand, if I feel like I could trust that, I wish there was a button to just crazy mode, just go for it. Kind of digging a little bit into the product team's way of working, what are KPIs that you all use to track progress? I don't know, either amongst some of the teams you lead or also just broadly progress on self-driving technology. How do you know you're making progress? Is it just miles driven as something else?
Shweta Shrivastava (16:12):
There are tons of these metrics that we analyze on a daily basis, weekly basis depending upon what the metric is. But if I were to categorize them in two broad categories, that'd be the commercial and operational metrics and the system behavior metrics. So, one important thing to note here is that we're in a proof of concept or a pilot phase anymore. This is the service that we are offering to riders. Paid service in Phoenix and also it's open to public in San Francisco, so it's an actual service.
(16:46):
And so, we're tracking the commercial metrics in terms of the trips per week, the daily or weekly active users and all the funnel metrics that you can think of. Also, the operational metrics, the cost, right? Well, how much is the thing costing us to operate? So that's, I would say, all the stuff on the commercial scaling side. And then on the driver performance, the vehicle driver as the technology name as I alluded to earlier, the driver performance metrics, they span across safety, the compliance to the road rules, our ability to make adequate progress as in not get unduly stopped or stranded in dense traffic situations as an example.
Lenny (17:32):
What are just specific metrics there? Anything you could share just like what is the actual goal in one of those teams?
Shweta Shrivastava (17:38):
The goal here is to be able to drive safer than humans. Now, we don't really have one standard human driving benchmark, safety benchmark, that everybody uses, but we do gather enough of that data. We have access to enough of that data to form an opinion on or a metric on or benchmark on what does human driving look like, how many collisions, as an example, a human driver would have every a hundred thousand mile. And then we want to make sure that our performance is better than that.
(18:19):
So that's simplifying, right? And several things go into both calculating the benchmark as well as our performance against that benchmark. But that at the core of it, that's what we're trying to do. So that's on the safety side and then I would say on the stops and strands, which is trying to, which goes in the different direction. Hey, you can be very safe if you're not moving at all. That's not what we're building. We need to make sure that the riders get to their destination on time. So it has to be appropriately assertive and be making the right progress.
(18:53):
And, so again, how much did the vehicle slow down unduly, right? Or, in how many instances in a given week did it have to rely on a rescue help? Those are the situations that we want to avoid. And then, how much did we slow down the traffic for other users? So we again do extensive benchmarking and look at the priors, et cetera, and really understand would an adequate performance be there and measure our own against that.
Lenny (19:28):
Awesome. Today's episode is brought to you by Elements. I just recently discovered this stuff actually from another podcast and it is such sweet, salty goodness. Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency.
(19:57):
Element is the exclusive hydration partner to team US USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes. Also, dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on Element to stay hydrated along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try Element totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor.
(20:27):
My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.
(20:38):
I'm guessing you're not going to have an answer to when do we think we'll have fully self-driving level five autonomy. So let me ask you a different approach to that question of just what's most in the way of us getting to full self-driving where we don't have to do anything ever? Is it like miles driven? Is it like tech breakthroughs that still have to happen? Is it regulation and just cities being like, okay, it's fine. What's the biggest blocker at this point or bottleneck?
Shweta Shrivastava (21:01):
So let me share my opinion on the L5.
Lenny (21:01):
Cool.
Shweta Shrivastava (21:06):
So L for those who might not be very familiar with this term, L2, L3 is still very much driver assist. It gets to some level of autonomy but then it relies on the human driver at the wheel to be able to take over complex situations. L4 fully autonomous without a human driver at the wheel and no expectation of a human driver at the wheel. That's what we've been focusing on. L5 would be in any kind of road completely unstructured, off-roading in that kind of an environment, be able to drive without any map, without any priors, what have you.
(21:44):
And we believe that by offering the kind of service that we are offering in Phoenix and in San Francisco through the rest of this year and other cities in future is it helps realize that the dream of the fully autonomous driving, in a big way, without having to go to L5. So I think that the technology is already there. L5, I'm not sure, maybe that becomes more niche, et cetera. It solves very specific use cases.
(22:16):
In terms of the blocker, I would say, the technology is there, but it still needs improvements. Especially we were not able to drive in snow yet. Something that we have to tackle in future.
Lenny (22:25):
I could barely drive in slow.
Shweta Shrivastava (22:28):
Yeah. And I don't like to drive in snow. Even I, I avoid snowy days. But that is something that we still have to build as a capability in driving fully in snow now. So that's great.
Lenny (22:39):
Makes sense. Clearly, there's a lot of little things, a lot of big things and it's a really interesting point about we don't need L5, L4 is great for most people. Maybe a last question along this track and then I want to pivot to a different area. So Waymo's been this long-term investment for Alphabet and many PMs often try to create buy-in and keep buy-in for large investment and large project. I know this is a different scale of investment than what most PMs work through. But is there anything you've learned about keeping leaders bought in and excited and continuing to invest in a project for years and years? Specifically just like tactics that keep people excited and bought into a long-term investment?
Shweta Shrivastava (23:21):
Yeah. So first of all, we are fortunate that we have the backing from Alphabet and other investors. And the autonomous vehicle industry is interesting and I think the last year has been interesting with more consolidation happening. So I think the name of the game here is to show progress, show meaningful progress and meaningful progress, not just in terms of technology but in terms of commercial deployments. That is the rubber meets the road, if you will, phase off of the product.
(23:54):
And the results have to speak for themselves, for our investors to have the confidence in us. So notwithstanding what's happening to other AB companies in the industry, it's about what we are doing. And then look at the progress that we've been making and where we are headed. And the fact that we've been accelerating our milestones and going through our own expectations, I think, these are very positive signals to our investors as well.
(24:23):
Another startup as well, t's not about you have to do what's the right thing for the business. Your focus is on creating value for the customers, creating value for the riders. You have to build a business that makes sense and the investors see that too. Or we're not going to do something unnatural or something that doesn't align with the business goals in order to gain any short term brownie points with investors. I think it doesn't work that way and the investors will see through that too.
(24:52):
Definitely Alphabet has been our backer for forever. So, it's really about focusing on building the right business and doing the right thing for the users.
Lenny (25:03):
I think that's a great takeaway that if you're finding that there's a buy-in and continued support for what you're building, focus on momentum and showing success. It's pretty simple if you think about it. And it's hard to cut something that's just showing success. And so, even at the scale of Waymo, it's a great lesson. So that makes sense.
Shweta Shrivastava (25:03):
Absolutely.
Lenny (25:24):
We talked a bit about other companies you've worked at and so I want to kind of zoom out a little bit. And I just want to ask, you worked at Amazon, Cisco, Waymo now, startup you mentioned. What are just some of the biggest lessons you've learned about building successful teams and successful products?
Shweta Shrivastava (25:40):
In terms of the product, whether you're working for a big company or a startup, the core product management tenant is still the same, which is, you have to work backwards from the customer problem or the user problem. Building a technology for the sake of it doesn't really go that far, so you really have to focus on the, what are you building, who are you building it for and what problem are you solving?
(26:05):
And this applies in any context. And Amazon has this great process where the PMs have to write a press release for the finished product even before they start building the product. That's the first thing that they have to do is to write that press release like the product is about to launch today. What are you telling the users about that product? Really forces them to think about the value proposition more thoroughly.
(26:33):
And I know many other companies are starting to look at that practice as well, but I find it very effective.
Lenny (26:39):
Do you do that at Waymo or do you folks do that? Is there kind of a system there or?
Shweta Shrivastava (26:43):
The explicit PR FAQ process that Amazon follows is, I think, Waymo has its own version of it. But it is about sort of focusing on the customer problem. Now, Waymo is also a very different kind of product. It's highly integrated. And different types of product management flavors, if you will. Some are more technically focused and technically deep, some are more commercially focused. So they all adapt. They have their versions of working backwards from the customer problem. But that still remains the core tenant in my mind.
(27:13):
The other big lesson, at least working in some of the large companies that I have had is it's also very important to know what you're not building. And this one is not only in big companies, I would say even in startups, it's extremely important to know what you're not building because you could very easily get swayed by customer X telling you to do this, customer y telling you to do that. And a product that tries to be all things to all people usually doesn't end up going anywhere.
(27:42):
So that focus, that prioritization and being crisp about what you're building and what you're not building is very important. And then, in the context of the large companies, what I was going to say was, I think, is the classic innovator's dilemma. The large companies tend to be the market share leaders in their focus areas. And so, the product team and the product leaders can get very incremental in their product strategy and then lo and behold, you see an upstart that comes and disrupts them.
(28:16):
And so, I have definitely learned the lesson that you need to disrupt yourself before somebody else does because it's going to happen. It's inevitable. And large companies that are constantly challenging themselves and disrupting their own models or their own product capabilities to bring those, even something more transformational for the customers, are the ones that really succeed. And I think this is where the product leaders have to bring in that mindset of, hey, are we getting too complacent or it's time to just.
Lenny (28:46):
That's such a good reminder. Is there an example of you doing that or something you worked on where you got the company to commit to something that maybe could have been a threat from a disruptor or maybe even just seen that happening at a company? Just like is there a specific project or investment that comes to mind?
Shweta Shrivastava (29:02):
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]At Amazon, I was the first PM and then I drove the team around it for a no-code application development platform called Honey Code. So that was a brand new service. Amazon had never delved in that space before. It was more infrastructure focused and this was first of its kind service that the team worked on. And this has played out many times in my career, and so I am a big believer in disrupting yourself before somebody else does it.
Lenny (29:33):
What do you think is the most underrated PM skill that you suggest people, maybe especially early in their career, that they should focus on maybe that they're probably not thinking about?
Shweta Shrivastava (29:42):
I think the listening and empathy are the top ones. These are very important because I think when folks think about product management, they think about the influencing without authority and prioritization and being able to write with PR, et cetera, all those things are sort of more top of mind. The listening and empathy, I wouldn't say that they are underrated, I think is there's now a lot more recognition that these are sort of core skills if you want to be able to influence a lot without authority.
But I think it's easier said than done. You really have to come in with that growth mindset, with that beginner's mindset, be able to absorb and just learn and listen and don't jump in with ideas necessarily, right? Take the time to formulate that opinion to really learn and understand the customer and the market and really be true to that tenant of working backwards from the customer problem, not just say because it's become such a platitude now in the product world.
Lenny (30:42):
Yeah, there's a book. There's a whole book called Working Backwards now.
Shweta Shrivastava (30:46):
Yes. That is the one thing that I would say that somebody who's starting out as a product manager really try to follow that principle. And then listening and empathy is going to go a long way in terms of being able to do that.
Lenny (31:00):
On listening and empathy, what do you think helped you most develop those two skills?
Shweta Shrivastava (31:06):
So I think for me, part of it was just doing this over and over again in different environments, in different product launches that I have led in different types of companies that I've worked with. In startup as well as big company, the dynamic is different. And, again, the team that you're working with in different companies have a different culture. So, when you're working with let's say an engineering leader, being able to understand what are his or her constraints? Where is he or she coming from? What does impact look like to that person? And then understanding where you're aligned, where you're not aligned are things that you have to develop and start paying a lot more attention to as you rise in your career or go up the ladder.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And I think a lot of that for me came by just being in different kind of situations and different kind of environments.
Lenny (32:08):
Yeah. That's what I often say also, a lot of this just comes from doing it again and again and again. There's not going to take a course and then just I'm a great listener, I'm done.
Shweta Shrivastava (32:18):
Yeah, no, it doesn't.
Lenny (32:19)
Yeah, which is not easy to ... It'd be nice if there's a book you read and then you become a great listener and a great empathizer.
Shweta Shrivastava (32:24):
Well, I think one take or one that I could share is just challenging your own assumptions. So, I think listening with an open mind but then are you proactively trying to challenge your own assumptions is extremely important. As a big enough product manager as well as a seasoned product leader, if you're not doing enough of that, then I think you might not be listening well, right? Or you might not be picking on the cues. If there's no conflict, if there's no contention, then something is missing.
Lenny (33:03):
It's not often you're going to be always right.
Shweta Shrivastava (33:04):
Yeah.
Lenny (33:05):
Maybe one more question along these lines. You've been promoted many times, now you're in a place where you promote people and I'm curious for someone that maybe wants to get promoted or struggling to get promoted, what would you say are probably the reasons they aren't? Or what do you think people should focus on if they want to just get a promotion and many promotions in their career?
Shweta Shrivastava (33:28):
I'm going to say something that might sound a little cheeky, but I think the way to get promoted is to not want it too badly. It is about you have to focus on the impact. It's about having an impact and then doing what is right for the business. So not sort of optimizing things for your promotion, which look, we are all ambitious human beings. And there's nothing wrong with wanting a promotion, just to be clear, and there's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but then focus on the impact.
(34:03):
Are you working on the right things that will have the right outcome for the business? Because if you are and if you are giving it to your 100%, that will be visible. And making your ambitions known to your manager, to your leader, is a good thing that you should. And so, when the right opportunity comes, at least your leader or manager is aware that, hey, this person wanted to work on something more challenging, so maybe I put her on that project.

But you have to be focused on really creating the right impact for the company and not optimizing for yourself to get promoted. If you try to maneuver that too much, it becomes visible and it's not a positive signal to the organization when they can see that that's what you're trying to do. And it also distracts you from the things that you need to be focusing on. So, I would say, improve your skillset as a product manager. Make sure that you're made your vision known that you want to work on challenging high visibility projects or products that really test or stretch your skills and then be really dedicated to that cause and work on what has the business impact for the company, do the right things.
Lenny (35:15):
I really like that advice. I 100% agree with all of that. I have a couple final Waymo questions and then we're going to get to our very exciting lightning round. Just for folks that maybe want to try out Waymo, so maybe just like where's it live now? When do you think it'll roll out to new cities? And then, how do people try it and use it if they live in one of those cities? If that's possible.
Shweta Shrivastava (35:37):
We are already in the Phoenix metro area and in San Francisco. So in those cities you can just go and download the app and you can use the service. We have done initial fully autonomous testing in LA. And we're going to be expanding in LA through the rest of the year, so stay tuned for more development on that front. And then, we do have a list of cities that we're going to be rolling out in the coming years, but unfortunately, I can't share that list just as yet.
Lenny (36:04):
And if someone lives in one of those cities, is there a way they could try to get on a wait list or try to use this stuff or is it closed doors right now?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:11):
So it is open doors in San Francisco and Phoenix.
Lenny (36:15):
Got it. So you just sign up and you get on the waitlist and then you might get off?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:17):
In Phoenix, I don't even think that there is a wait list.
Lenny (36:20):
Oh wow.
Shweta Shrivastava (36:21):
On the waitlist.
Lenny (36:22):
I got to move to Phoenix. That's cool.
Shweta Shrivastava (36:24):
Or just wait, just yeah, a little while in San Francisco. But yeah, Phoenix is great. So, if you want to move there, that's totally fine.
Lenny (36:33):
No, I'm going to start packing tonight. Just joking. Anything else you want to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:40):
No, I think we talked about a bunch of things. It's been a great conversation so far.
Lenny (36:45):
It's not over yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I have six questions for you. Are you ready?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:51):
Bring it on.
Lenny (36:52):
Okay, here we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:58):
Crossing The Chasm by Geoffrey Moore and Clayton Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma are still sort of the two classics in product management that I have quoted a lot and I have recommended to many folks.
Lenny (37:12):
Awesome. I've got both in my little bookshelf behind me.
Shweta Shrivastava (37:14):
Yeah, me too.
Lenny (37:15):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Shweta Shrivastava (37:19):
I have an eight-year-old daughter, so my viewing choices are very much influenced by what she watches. But let's see, I did enjoy the Top Gun, the new Top Gun movie, Top Gun Maverick quite a bit. We watched it in the theater and visuals were just fantastic. I think it was also inspiring to see what Tom Cruise was able to do and it's quite a feat that he pulled off at this age. It was very inspirational.
Lenny (37:49):
Fully agree. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people?
Shweta Shrivastava (37:53):
Especially at the senior levels, I always ask them, when was one time that you failed and what did you learn from it? I've seen that folks who has either say that they've never failed or they're trying a success story as a failure story are usually, they're disingenuous or have not had the depth of experience. So I ask that question and I'm looking for some real solid examples there.
Lenny (38:21):
Awesome. What's a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?
Shweta Shrivastava (38:27):
I wouldn't say that I recently discovered it. It's on my wishlist to buy very soon. I'm all for sustainable mobility, so I am shopping for a foldable ebike so I can do more mountain biking without doing mountain biking. That's the sustainable part for me, I guess.
Lenny (38:47):
Is there a specific model or brand that you are most excited about?
Shweta Shrivastava (38:50):
I would take recommendations from you, but I'm still shopping. I think electric, there are a couple.
Lenny (38:57):
All right. Folks who have recommendations, leave suggestions in the comments.
Shweta Shrivastava (39:01):
Please do.
Lenny (39:01):
And what's something relatively minor you've changed in your team's product development process that you've found has had a tremendous impact?
Shweta Shrivastava (39:09):
I wouldn't say that this is a product development process, although, in different parts of phase of my career, I have definitely instituted different types of processes and tools that have helped improve the product development. But I would give you an interesting one that I use a lot in my prior company and then I use a different form of it here in Waymo is what I used to call as the rule of seven. If there have been seven emails in an email thread and you still haven't resolved the issue, just call the person or get in a room huddle, resolve it live.
(39:43):
But the long email exchanges that don't converge and go anywhere I feel are a waste of time for many people. So I'm like, you've got to a limit. Waymo is a bigger company, so the limit's more like 10, but if you haven't resolved something within an X number of emails, please just get on a call, get in a room and get it resolved.
Lenny (40:04):
I love that. And the idea is it's seven if it's like you and that person going back and forth seven times?
Shweta Shrivastava (40:09):
Yeah. Or all of people are just going back and forth. And then adding more people and then everybody chime in, but where is this thing really headed?
Lenny (40:21):
I love that. Final question. If anyone gets to ride in a Waymo, what's a pro tip for them to have an awesome experience?
Shweta Shrivastava (40:29):
Bring your favorite playlist, sit back and enjoy the ride.
Lenny (40:33):
Great. When I was on my right, I turned on some jazz and it was raining outside. It was real cozy.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:39):
But did you actually do it on the ... So, so there's a feature, if you have a Google, you have to download the Google Assistant, but you can actually play your playlist list in the car.
Lenny (40:49):
That's cool. No, I chose a station that was in there just like jazz music.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:52):
Okay. Yeah.
Lenny (40:39):
Yeah. Okay. This is great. All right. Hopefully I get another ride someday.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:56):
Yes, you should.
Lenny (40:57):
Shweta, this was amazing. I am going to start packing my bags for Phoenix. I'm going to sell my car. Everything's going to change
Shweta Shrivastava (41:04):
Exactly what we wish for.
Lenny (41:07):
There's your KPI. Thank you again for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask you maybe some questions, maybe apply to join Waymo if you're hiring, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Shweta Shrivastava (41:20):
You can find me on LinkedIn. And then if you are interested in opportunities at Waymo, go to Waymo career web page. You should see all the open positions. It's okay for you to reach out to me on LinkedIn as well for product management roles. How can listeners be useful to me? I would say, hey, sign up for the ride in Phoenix or San Francisco and LA when we open up, give us feedback.
Lenny (41:43):
Awesome. Shweta, thank you again for being here.
Shweta Shrivastava (41:47):
Thank you. It was great to have this conversation.

# Lessons from scaling Ramp | Sri Batchu (Ramp, Instacart, Opendoor)

## Transcript

Sri Batchu (00:00:00):
I do think there's actually a general path that most B2B companies take and should take. My view is you start off with founder-led sales, the early team needs to know how to actually sell. Then you hire your first couple of salespeople, then you start some very low cost targeted marketing efforts. So whether it's content, community, small scale events, and then PR, after all of that is when you start paid and brand effort and then SEO probably start around the same time that you start paid marketing efforts. The reason for the progression the way I've described it is the channels get more expensive as you go farther along and they get more effective as you understand more about your customers.

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Sri Batchu. Sri was VP of Ops at Opendoor, then head of growth at Instacart, and currently he's the head of growth at Ramp, which as you'll hear at the top of the episode, is the fastest growing SaaS business and the fastest growing FinTech business in history. They hit a hundred million dollar yearly run rate in two years, which is absurd, and in the last year grew 4X during a period where most companies barely grew at all. I recently did a newsletter post on how Ramp builds product with their VP of product, Geoff Charles. And in this episode, we zeroed in on Ramp's approach to growth. We chat about what Ramp did in the early days to kickstart growth, how they mostly grow these days, how their growth team is structured, their prioritization framework plus their north star metrics.

Lenny (00:01:37):
Also, how they operationalize velocity, which is at the core of their team culture. Ramp is a really special company that is clearly on an incredible journey and I am really excited to share this glimpse into how they operate. Enjoy this episode with Sri Batchu after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Attio, a new type of CRM that's powerful, flexible, and built around your data. Traditional CRMs were built for a different era with totally different speed, scale, and data demands. Attio is different. It allows you to quickly build a CRM that matches your unique workflows and data structures. Within minutes of connecting your email and calendar, you'll have a CRM that's already set up complete with customer profiles and automatic data enrichment. You'll also have realtime dynamic reporting at your fingertips. No more slow deployments, outdated user experiences or tedious manual data input.

Get started today and get 15% off your first year at attio.com/lenny. That's A-T-T-I-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:11):
More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates and within that post they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda.

Lenny (00:03:36):
Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (00:04:10):
Sri, welcome to the podcast.

Sri Batchu (00:04:12):
Thank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm a huge fan and I've been following the podcast and the newsletter. So excited to be on here.

Lenny (00:04:18):
Really appreciate that. So let's talk about Ramp. So Ramp where you lead growth is apparently one of the fastest growing products in history. I believe it's the fastest growing SaaS product and business and also the fastest growing FinTech business. So first of all, is that generally true and correct?

Sri Batchu (00:04:38):
Yeah, I mean I'm sure you know of Packy and he's done a great analysis where he shared this work and compared us to a bunch of other companies and when he released this a year ago, we were the fastest growing company to a hundred million dollars of annualized revenue at the time. I don't know if there's been others since, but certainly not in the FinTech category as far as I know.

Lenny (00:04:58):
Okay. So you said the fastest growing to a hundred million. I think it took two years to get to a hundred million and run rate, right?

Sri Batchu (00:05:03):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:05:03):
That's insane because rarely is there all of this money sitting around for a company to just come in and accumulate and grab from people and provide that amount of value. So that's an insane stat. Maybe another question along these lines, is there any other just stats you could share, but just the scale of Ramp or just the speed that Ramp has grown?

Sri Batchu (00:05:23):
We publicly disclosed that last year we grew Forex on top of that, very sizable based from the year prior and Okta actually released some recent stats on fastest growing software companies among SMB and mid-market and Ramp was by far the fastest growing despite the fact that a bunch of others on the list were materially smaller. The company's still very lean for the amount of growth. We're under 500 people roughly today at that scale and that's definitely have a much higher revenue per employee than some of our other competitors and others in the space. And yeah, I mean we've got a very thoughtful and smart finance team that I've worked with actually closely our old head of strategic finance at Instacart and they set ambitious goals for us on growth and I'm happy to say we've consistently beat those ambitious goals over the last 16 months or 18 months since I've joined.

Lenny (00:06:16):
Which is especially challenging in this environment. So it's extra meaningful. Okay, so here's the big question I want to start off with. I know you weren't there at the beginning of Ramp's journey, but from what you know, what do you think the team did early on to seed this level of growth and success other than just building an awesome product that people really love? And if that's the answer, that's fine, but usually that's part of it. I'm curious just like is there some clever unique tactics that they used to help create that incredible growth from the beginning?

Sri Batchu (00:06:49):
I think you're certainly right on the product side. Obviously you've recently written about Ramp's product engine with Geoff and that there's been incredible product market fit because of the product team that deeply understood the customer experience and I think that's certainly helped initial word of mouth. One thing that I did want to point out that Ramp did that was interesting is obviously Eric and Karim, the co-founders of Ramp, were previous founders of another company that they had a successful exit on.

Sri Batchu (00:07:15):
So they had a strong reputation as founders and came in with the right set of experience to build Ramp and one of the things that they did is what I call cap table as a growth strategy where they did a great job of getting a large number of early stage founders and other influential operators and advisors onto the cap table at the company. And many of our initial customers were these companies that were on the cap table or the founders were on the cap table for. And Ramp today is actually not majority startups or tech companies anymore. The vast majority of our customers are mid-market and enterprise. That's where our revenue comes from. But there's a lot of love among the tech founder community because of the early days, both the product quality as well as all of these investors that Ramp got.

Lenny (00:08:08):
Wow. I have not heard of this strategy before and I didn't know this was actually a big part of the initial story. So is there examples of folks that they had on their cap table that are examples of folks that helped them grow initially like this?

Sri Batchu (00:08:20):
One example that I can think of is Eight Sleep founder, he's been very close to the Ramp team, same with the Pod founder and then a bunch of VC firms that are investors in the company are also customers of the company.

Lenny (00:08:32):
Do you know if the strategy there was VCs who connect them to small companies that would use Ramp or is it directly founders of companies that would immediately use Ramp?

Sri Batchu (00:08:43):
Yeah, I'll say it was more founders and executives of customers that can use Ramp. Certainly we have a fantastic group of very sophisticated investors who have made introductions to Ramp as well and that helped. But I will say that is not as big of a channel as one might expect because companies have their own decision making frameworks for selecting a product like Ramp and the investor opinion and recommendation matters, but turns out it doesn't matter maybe as much as another customer who's actually used the product that they know or are actually experiencing the product.

Lenny (00:09:17):
Amazing, awesome tactic. I've not heard of that before. In terms of growth, how much of growth of early Ramp was new customers versus expansion within existing customers? Because what's cool about credit card is people spend more, you make more money because you're taking a piece of that. So roughly how much of the growth insanity over the first couple of years was from expansion within existing customers?

Sri Batchu (00:09:39):
Obviously many of our early customers have grown quite a bit and our whole strategy is to save companies time and money so they can redeploy that in other ways for their own growth or other objectives. And we obviously are growing our product suite as well like BillPay, Flex, et cetera, where our customers can spend more money on Ramp and get more value out of Ramp. Having said all of that, what's interesting is that the vast majority of our growth back then and even to this day is via new customer acquisition. It's just we are adding so many more customers that the growth of our customers while strong and important part of our growth lever is not nearly as material as you might think.

Lenny (00:10:21):
Okay, awesome. So that's a good segue to the next question I had, which is if you're going to create a pie chart of how Ramp grows and ideally if you could even share early on and then now, how does that pie chart look? What are the slices of that pie and then what are the rough percentages of where growth comes from for Ramp?

Sri Batchu (00:10:37):
Rather than going into the specifics, one thing I'll say about the growth system today is if you were to look at what percentage of our business comes from outbound sales, paid marketing, field, and then a bunch of other channels and then you compare it against industry benchmarks, I think the secret sauce of Ramp is not that we've found a channel that's unique and that we've over-invested or under-invested. I don't think our distribution would be not that far off from looking at other companies at our size and stage.

Sri Batchu (00:11:10):
I think what we've done differently is we've really focused on making all of those investments very much driven by technology and data. And so one example that I'll give you is that our sales teams are actually incredibly efficient by any metric that we look at and we obviously benchmark them. And the reason for that is because we actually have a growth engineering team that's dedicated to supporting that efficiency but including adjusting third party data and using AI to automate much of their workflow, et cetera. And we've been doing this well before AI has become the buzzword for a lot of folks, but this is something we've had this team for almost two years now that that's been working on sales automation and data to just make our sales teams more efficient. That's just one example, but we've got similar types of mandates for every channel that we invest in and thinking about how do we inform this better customer and prospect data and how do we automate and technologize it so that we can build that competitive mode for each channel.

Lenny (00:12:13):
I'd love to learn more about this growth eng team that works with sales. How is that structured maybe as the first question and then just what are their goals? How do you measure their progress and success?

Sri Batchu (00:12:24):
A lot of companies do it differently. I think what works really well with Ramp is that we have the same shared goal, which is the pipeline driven and the payback period of the channel. It's unique to Ramp where the engineers feel ownership of the quota. They're not owning product metrics or what have you, they're obviously of course interim and input metrics that are important, but they really do feel accountable for the pipeline driven and the efficiency driven by that team. And I think that naturally allows them bottom up to come with the right projects that they think will have maximal impact on efficiency and top line.

Lenny (00:13:04):
So what are the sorts of things they do for a sales team? Is it like they help them prioritize leads or is it they help craft their messaging? Which parts are maybe most important?

Sri Batchu (00:13:15):
All of the above, helping find the right prospects, sending them the right messaging as well as prioritizing responses and drafting potential responses for the team as well.

Lenny (00:13:26):
Fascinating. How much impact have you seen that has on sales?

Sri Batchu (00:13:30):
It's incredibly helpful to our sales team and it's one of our most efficient channels as I've mentioned. So I think that there is something unique about our ability to bring technology to every channel.

Lenny (00:13:41):
Super interesting. Maybe on that topic, can you just talk about how your growth team is structured at Ramp? What are the kind of sub-teams and how do you think about?

Sri Batchu (00:13:50):
We've got an organization today that might evolve and if we get to that topic we can talk about it, but historically the way we've been organized is we've got channel based teams that are deploying spend in a given channel. So we've got a paid marketing team, a lifecycle CRM team, we've got a field marketing team, et cetera. And then we've got a product engineering team that is supporting growth and sales and helping each of these channels be more effective that's dedicated to growth. And then separate from that, we've got a small kind of what I call an innovation or skunk work type of team that works on cross-channel. Just things that don't neatly fit into a box that we think could be cool or fun to try to just do more experimentation that is cross-channel, cross-team.

Lenny (00:14:37):
Definitely sounds like the most fun team. What are some of the things they've done or work on in the skunk works team?

Sri Batchu (00:14:42):
They've done testing of new channels that don't necessarily fit into very... And that includes new online platforms. They've done some interesting stuff on TikTok and Reddit and other places, things like that. They've focused on referrals and how to make that a more delightful experience for the customers, first party events, things like that. Things that are often smaller scale and if they work we can invest more and make them larger scale later.

Lenny (00:15:16):
I love it. So the teams roughly is there's a paid growth team that just works on paid growth optimization, lifecycle CRM team basically it's like emails I imagine is a big part of that.

Sri Batchu (00:15:26):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:15:27):
Then there's a field sales support team and then there's the sales team, kind of eng sales team that you talked about and then I also imagine there's like a self-serve.

Sri Batchu (00:15:37):
Yeah, exactly. There's a self-serve activation eng team as well. And then of course there's SEO and website and bound lead channel management team.

Lenny (00:15:47):
And then this awesome skunk works team. I love it. Okay, so shifting a little bit, something that comes across often and consistently with Ramp, and this came across very clearly in the post that I did on how Ramp builds product with Geoff is velocity and how important velocity is at Ramp. There's this awesome quote that I'll read here from Keith Rabois who I think led many of the rounds of Ramp. He started Founders Fund, famous investor. He said that, "Ramp's product velocity is absolutely unprecedented in my 21 years working with technology businesses." So here's my question to you. Can you just talk about what that actually looks like and feels like working inside Ramp with this intense velocity?

Sri Batchu (00:16:30):
Yeah, it is a great question and Keith is amazing and then probably one of the smartest investors that I've ever had a good fortune of working with both here as well as at Opendoor, and I'll say he's absolutely right about that. And what you see internally is what I'll say is razor-sharp focus on reducing cycle time and bias to action and how do we reduce cycle time. I think it's basically the core of it culturally to me is getting people to think about smaller units of time for decision making. It seems obvious but I think you really have to reinforce it culturally. So one thing that Eric, our CEO, does, which I don't know if you've heard externally, is we have days.ramp.com where we can see how many days it's been since the founding of Ramp internally and it's day 1,529 at Ramp. He has that number of days at every board meeting, at every all hands.

Sri Batchu (00:17:28):
It's just to remind people that we don't work in years, quarters, weeks, we work in days. Each day matters and so never put out something tomorrow that you know can get done today. And that bias to action really permeates not just in the product teams but everywhere. So our growth team, which as I've just described, is extremely cross-functional, a lot of marketing folks and other expertise on the team, but we work a lot like a product team, we work on two-week sprints, we cross-prioritize across these teams and we work all together rather than in separate silos within the growth team.

Lenny (00:18:08):
So I pulled up the site you just mentioned, days.ramp.com, and not only is it days since launch, which is 1,529 when I'm looking at it, there's a many decimal points that are counting up. 1,529.43453142. Oh my god. Okay. Is that a new addition, the decimal points?

Sri Batchu (00:18:29):
No, I think that's always been there. It's just amping it up, how much time is passing. It could be stressful at times, but I think that the mitigating factor is that it's been able, as you know, A players want to work with A players attract A players and retain A players, and Ramp has done a really great job of hiring people that are fantastic that can work in this environment well and are motivated by the success and the winning from this sort of culture.

Lenny (00:18:58):
Yeah, I was actually talking to Eric about it for another piece I'm working on and he was showing me some early board decks in every deck as you said has day 544 of Ramp. So it's very real what you're talking about. Is there anything else that just as someone that came into Ramp from other traditional companies that also move really fast, Instacart and Opendoor, that is just like holy moly, this is velocity? You talked about a few things but is there anything just like holy shit?

Sri Batchu (00:19:26):
You can see the cycle time thing in terms of responsiveness from everybody at Ramp and I think typically what you tend to see is as companies get bigger, they evolve off of Slack to email and everything just moves a little bit slower and there's process and then there's obviously a lot of good parts of that but Ramp, what I noticed when I joined and true to this day is how quickly people will respond on Slack and jump on things and even if they don't complete it, there's very clear action item on who the owner will be and what the deadline will be even if it's not. And that to me was always very impressive just about... And I think it's one of those things we build in public, so everything is very visible so you can see how this is working across teams and I'm glad that we've been able to maintain that culture even as we've gotten much bigger.

Lenny (00:20:21):
There's two effects of that I imagine. One is how do you stay in the flow and get work done if you're just expected to constantly respond? How does that actually work?

Sri Batchu (00:20:31):
I don't think the expectation is necessarily that one constantly responds, but it is something that I have seen people are good at. And so I think one of the things that, again, not like a novel productivity tool, but something that Ramp does do is just trying to think about focus time and response times and using calendar blocking to really effectively manage your time that way. And then doing calendar audits of yourself as well as of your team to say, okay, what are your highest priorities for this week, this day, this month? And how does your calendar reflect your priorities? Because in many ways you ship your calendar and so thinking about how are you spending your time and then blocking your time accordingly.

Lenny (00:21:15):
And is this mostly a cultural just this is how we operate or is there a principles or sorts of processes that are set up to help people do those sorts of things?

Sri Batchu (00:21:24):
Yeah, it's cultural in terms of how we operate, but we also have templates. Our people team has a template on how to do a calendar audit properly and things like that. So we've tried to create some learning materials as well for folks that are new to get into the flow of way of working.

Lenny (00:21:45):
Awesome. Okay, so then the other elephant in the room with talking about working really fast and hard and responding really quickly is work-life balance and burnout and things like that. One thing I'll say is I believe in working really hard and working long hours as a important ingredient to success. I know there's been a bit of a backlash against that and just like, no, you shouldn't work really hard, you can be successful without doing that. I don't think that's true. So with that said, I guess what have you learned and what do you think Ramp has learned about how to find that balance and not just-

Sri Batchu (00:22:17):
Yeah. I completely agree with you. I do think, especially earlier in your career, hard work is so important both for learning but also impact and it's a tough balance that a lot of successful companies struggle with. I think my biggest learnings is it's, A, some of it is like self-selection, right? You're hiring people that are excited about doing this work and this way of working, but at least I tend to find the people that I've worked with that are highly successful, ours are not the problem. It's really autonomy, flexibility, and mission alignment and the general happiness they get from their work. And so that's what I try to focus on, which is not the hours that someone's put in, but quality of the work and the impact. And I think a big part of the push to having great results and working hard is really being grateful and appreciating the team when they do push themselves and celebrating wins.

Sri Batchu (00:23:23):
And I think we could always be doing a better job, but I think we've historically done a great job at that, at celebrating wins big and small. And I think part of the culture of building in public and open internally helps with that. So people are always sharing their wins. And then it's a very one funny stat that I don't know if other companies track is we track engagement during all hands on the Zoom to see what percentage people participate. And it's usually close to a hundred percent, like people are talking, the entire company is talking on the Zoom chat because they're excited about the wins that their friends and colleagues are shipping and the things that we're talking about in the audience.

Lenny (00:24:05):
How do you actually track engagement? Someone sitting there watching who's in the chat?

Sri Batchu (00:24:08):
No, it must be some tool our IT team can do it. It can say what percentage of participants chatted or something like that.

Lenny (00:24:15):
I see. So it's not like who's looking at the screen, it's like who's talking in the chat?

Sri Batchu (00:24:18):
Yeah, exactly. Or reacting in the chat, et cetera.

Lenny (00:24:21):
That's awesome. And it's not like you must engage, it's more just like are we delivering the content.

Sri Batchu (00:24:26):
No. And by the way, this is probably the first time I'm sharing this. I don't think brand employees necessarily know this. I don't think we've actually shared this. I just heard it from our IT person recently and I thought that was a fun stat.

Lenny (00:24:38):
I love that because it's more just like are we providing value to people or are they actually excited and interested in this sort of thing? I was going to add onto your point about how working hard and working long hours can be seen as this like, "Oh, this sucks. I wish I was at home watching Netflix," but I find that the most fulfilling parts of my career or where I was just working insanely hard for a long time, as long as that work was meaningful, exactly like you said, it was something that mattered and came out and shipped and people were excited about it and if it wasn't like, "Oh, that was a waste of my life." So that super resonates.

Sri Batchu (00:25:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:25:10):
I want to come back to growth for a moment. I had a couple more questions I wanted to ask here. You talked about some of these teams that you have around ways you're driving growth. Is there an area you think you're going to be investing more in over time or that you feel is working better? I know there's trade secrets here that you don't want to share necessarily, but just anything that you feel is people are maybe under-appreciating or under-investing in that you think you might invest in more?

Sri Batchu (00:25:34):
What I'll say on that front is, look, we, like everybody else, are always focused on driving more efficiency in our growth engine. There are some channels that, and we have a diversified portfolio of bets, right? One thing that's interesting about the world of growth today is I think historically people that used to run growth were folks that had a marketing or a product background. And what you're seeing these days I think are more folks like me who actually come from an investor and analytics background to lead growth teams because growth has become more and more about a diversified portfolio of bets at a reasonable ROI and building a system that's designed around experimentation and data-oriented.

Sri Batchu (00:26:22):
So the reason I say all of that is our goal is to over time, of course, make all of our channels more efficient, but also allocate more to channels that are more efficient as long as they're scalable. And so the more that we can push customer awareness via owned and earned media, the better for us. And so we've got a few different strategies on that front, but we're also working on making our other channels more efficient by the day.

Lenny (00:26:54):
So mysterious, but I appreciate you sharing what you can. The point about the portfolio of bets is interesting because if you think about it, most companies initially grow from one. You talked about growth engines, that's the same term I use. Usually there's just one thing that helps you grow initially like SEO or word of mouth or maybe paid. And then eventually every single company basically ends up doing all the growth channels and then has a team dedicated to just keep optimizing SEO, keep optimizing referrals. So I think that's a very typical path. And then it's exactly said, how do we make each of these as efficient as possible?

Sri Batchu (00:27:28):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:27:29):
Maybe as another last question around Ramp's growth. Is there any other just really surprising, interesting, really effective tactics that helped Ramp grow over time?

Sri Batchu (00:27:41):
I think one thing that's been interesting is Ramp's ability to leverage PR as a growth machine. And as you've seen, we've got a fantastic PR and comms team and we get a lot of deserved good press through that. And one thing that's been interesting is our fundraising also as a growth strategy not obviously explicitly we've got very clear goals for our fundraising, but what we have seen is anytime that we've been fundraising and we've been using that as an effective way of creating a market moment, it's driven actually a non-trivial amount of top funnel for us.

Lenny (00:28:22):
People always talk about PR being like, people over overinvest in PR, they think PR is going to be this magical growth lever, but it actually works sometimes and in my opinion, you have to have something really interesting for it to work and obviously you guys do, the company's growing like crazy, which is innately an interesting story. The founders are really important and rarely is funding like an event anymore for most companies. So I mean this says a lot that people care about your funding.

Sri Batchu (00:28:51):
What you say it is exactly right is you have to be thoughtful about your PR moments. Everybody wants to announce things about themselves that's not necessarily interesting for the press or for an audience. And so thinking about how do you compile enough value to the general audience. So our fundraising announcements usually also have some additional color on something unique about the business that we share to provide more value to readers.

Lenny (00:29:20):
And then there's also newsletter people like me and Packy you mentioned who wrote about Ramp because it's also just so interesting. What's your sense of that versus traditional PR? There's this, I don't know, big debate of just traditional media's no longer relevant. All these other people will go through newsletters and podcasts and things like that. What's your sense there?

Sri Batchu (00:29:38):
It's what are the audiences that you get with each of these tactics. And so we do both obviously get some earned coverage in these newsletters and other tactics and we pay for some and we advertise in other cases. And what we tend to find is these are great reach, but they tend to work very well for actually hiring. It improves Ramp's reputation as a company for recruiting and hiring, which helps and they help with certain audience of customers, which is typically tech founders and folks close to the tech ecosystem. But as I mentioned, the vast majority of the world is not startups and the majority of Ramp's customers are no longer tech and startups. And so as we're thinking about ways to grow. I think channels like these are one piece of the equation, but I think traditional PR will remain another really important piece because they just target a different audience.

Lenny (00:30:38):
As you're talking, I'm watching the days count up on the days that Ramp page still and stressing me out. I feel like keeping you from doing work to keep growing Ramp, but let's keep going. I'm going to close this tab. You talked about growth engines. I'm curious what you've learned about building a growth engine in a company. And another way to put it is just a repeatable scalable growth process, whether it's at Ramp or Opendoor, Instacart,

Sri Batchu (00:31:03):
People talk a lot about what should the right design of the team be or profiles of people on the team, et cetera. And I'm happy to talk about what are the right profiles of people. I think that's an important conversation. But I think design of the team, people often... I think it's a red herring about team structure and team design and what's the right one, et cetera. I think most of that is irrelevant. What actually matters is culture and rituals and cadences rather than the team itself.

Sri Batchu (00:31:35):
And so what a great growth engine and a great growth team is one that where you set the culture, set very simple north star metrics, usually one, at most two. And you've created a culture of defining hypotheses that are data driven and a culture where that can be executed quickly and have an MVP mentality for product and non-product projects where people can fail and learn quickly and iterate quickly. So I think that part of it is more important than the specific people or their functions in many ways to me, especially when you're starting to build a growth engine. It's like can you build a set of people that can generate new ideas and evaluate them effectively and move quickly is really what you're trying to design for.

Lenny (00:32:29):
Let's unpack some of this because this is great. So in terms of north star metrics, what are some examples in your experience of good north star metrics? Revenue is obviously a very common one, but often it is too high level. Do you have a sense of what a good north star metric is?

Sri Batchu (00:32:43):
I like having two. One is something around volume and growth and you want that to be, A, very motivating and intuitive for people to understand and also, B, something that the growth teams can directly impact, right? Revenue is, for better or worse, more important to the company, but also much farther down the line of whether or not the growth team can impact that. And so at Instacart, for example, our north star metric for growth was monthly active orders. And that's what we all rallied around and looked at every day, how are now doing? And then obviously we had a large growth in consumer engineering team at Instacart, 300 plus people. And so there are people working on every single corner of the app and outside of the app on acquisition to drive growth. And it's like some of the stuff is minutia, right? It's making the checkout flow slightly better or faster or something like that.

Sri Batchu (00:33:42):
So that's a good example. It's like, okay, well, so we're going to goal that team on MAO, how are they going to move monthly active orders by making the checkout flow slightly better? Maybe they can have an impact or maybe not. And so one of the things that we did is the actual local team has their own metric that they can directly influence. You want to actually hold people accountable for things that they can influence. And then we created via the finance and data team, a translation layer for every team's metric into MAO.

Sri Batchu (00:34:13):
It would be like if you got one extra weekly order because of your checkout flow from the same customer, it would have point X impact on the company's MAO and then you would just roll up all project plans as well as project impact back into this singular MAO metric. And the other benefit of doing something like that is that it also helps you cross-prioritize much easier. Should we add more engineering to this team? Should we add more budget to that team? It's like, okay, well what's the MAO map? Where is there a more MAO per dollar or per engineer being built? And it just really helped us unify and move together.

Lenny (00:34:52):
I have questions about this. This is great. By the way, why is it monthly active orders versus just monthly orders? How can you be an inactive order?

Sri Batchu (00:35:00):
Sorry, orderer.

Lenny (00:35:02):
Oh, okay.

Sri Batchu (00:35:03):
So monthly active users basically is what it is, but we call them orders because users can just log in and not order, right.

Lenny (00:35:08):
Got it.

Sri Batchu (00:35:09):
You're actually ordering on the platform.

Lenny (00:35:11):
Yeah, I think there was this backlash against users at Facebook. I think it's monthly active people and so I get it. Okay, understood. Interesting. So you find that instead of sub-teams having a different metric that we just know is good. That's one of the variables in the formula of monthly active orders. You actually have a translation that converts that specific metric moving to the north star metric.

Sri Batchu (00:35:36):
The team on their day-to-day for their sprints, whatever are looking at their own metric. But for the purpose of planning and resource allocation and reporting, we would use the translation layers to actually just look at everything on a MAO basis.

Lenny (00:35:49):
Knowing those sorts of formulas are often not perfect, how much weight do you put into that formula specifically?

Sri Batchu (00:35:56):
Yeah. And I think in general the planning process is not perfect. You can have a financial plan in Excel and the reality can diverge quite a bit. The only thing you can be certain of is that you're not going to accomplish exactly the plan. So we did a couple of things to that. One is setting a culture of we know this isn't perfect, this is like 70/30, 80/20, it's to guide. So we wouldn't use the translation factor to make a marginal decision if something is five or 10% off.

Sri Batchu (00:36:29):
Those are done based on judgment because at the end of the day, regardless of what metric framework you use, marginal decisions are marginal for a reason. They're really hard things to decide. And so the framework helped with just reducing the cognitive overload of decision making to only those that are marginal. So the ones that are obvious that are going to have big impact becomes clear even if the measurement framework isn't perfect. And so that's what we use. And the other thing that we just had as cadence is we would actually update all of the translations every six months for the new planning cycle based on new information that we knew on how moving X impacts MAO.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Just to make it even more real, what are some examples of those lower level metrics? Is it increased conversion of sign up by X percent?

Sri Batchu (00:37:17):
Any number of things. It would be actually load time of the app on open. There's a team that's trying to make that faster or more efficient because we know that that impacts whether or not the person actually ends up ordering if it takes five seconds to load versus two seconds to load. And so the full customer experience were all segregated into different teams that were optimizing just like how long does it take to open, number of searches that a user does on the app. We know the people... And number of items that are put into cart, like amount of time from cart to check out, things like that we literally just map out any user's journey throughout the app and have separate engineering teams that are focused on that.

Lenny (00:38:04):
And there's essentially some kind of regression analysis that tells you here's load times impact on MAOs.

Sri Batchu (00:38:10):
Exactly. And the other thing that we did is just so we would've these translation factors, but we could also just see what the cumulative impact of all of the work is that Facebook did this too, which is just long-term holdouts for each surface area. So the checkout experience team that I've been talking about a lot for some reason would have their own holdout. And so we could see what the cumulative impact of monthly active orders on the people that got last half's experience versus this half's experience on the holdout. And that would make it very clear. So regression is one way to do it. And then basically effective A/B test, but was a small holdout.

Lenny (00:38:46):
Is there a holdout for the performance team where someone just has a really slow version of Instacart?

Sri Batchu (00:38:51):
I wonder actually, but there's holdout for almost everything. There's a holdout for ads, for example. So there are some lucky Instacart users out there that are not getting ads and they've never gotten ads because they've always been part of Instacart's advertising holding.

Lenny (00:39:08):
That'll be a great revenue boost whenever they want to kill that holdout.

Sri Batchu (00:39:13):
Can you imagine was a conversation internally on should there be a permanent holdout? Should it be last year's experience? How should we think about, especially because it's such a important driver of modernization?

Lenny (00:39:24):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo's a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

Lenny (00:39:51):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. EPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports, test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at getE-P-P-O.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:40:31):
Maybe just one last question along this specific thread is this framework of having everything translated into a north star metric something you bring to every place you work now? And is this just something you recommend? For example, does Ramp approach things this way as well?

Sri Batchu (00:40:44):
I think it depends on the size of the company. I think this actually becomes much more important as companies get bigger because there's more teams to prioritize and more resources to cross-allocate. And having a common currency makes that a lot easier. And so we do something similar at Ramp as well where we have translation factors for all of the various things that the teams are doing that translate back to the north star for Ramp.

Lenny (00:41:07):
Cool. And then are you up for sharing the Ramp's north star metric or do you want to keep that part?

Sri Batchu (00:41:12):
Yeah, I mean I can tell you what we used to do in the recent past we're evolving some things and in the recent past it was for the growth team, the north star was dollars of SQL pipeline. So anything anybody did, we would try to estimate the impact into what would be the dollars of sales qualified lead pipeline generated for Ramp. So if the website team wanted to change language on the card's landing page, their direct impact would be conversion rate of email submission or something like that would be what they would be optimizing for. And then we would have, okay, what does two bips of conversion rate mean for dollars of SQL pipeline? A lot or not a lot? And depending on that, it's like, "All right, don't waste your time doing that project. Let's do something else instead." So that just helps us score and prioritize efforts.

Lenny (00:42:03):
Here's a fun story. I actually tried to sign up for Ramp when I was starting this newsletter and business and it didn't let me because I had a Gmail-

Sri Batchu (00:42:09):
For Gmail, yeah.

Lenny (00:42:13):
So I moved on and that would've been such a huge revenue opportunity. I'm just joking.

Sri Batchu (00:42:18):
I know, I know. And I'm glad you brought that up because we are obviously aware of it and we are working on something for users that have put in a personal email address. in terms of how to reengage that.

Lenny (00:42:30):
You're about to 5X growth because I had no other domain at that point. Now I have Lenny's newsletter and stuff, so it's like, "Shit, I'm stuck."

Sri Batchu (00:42:39):
By the way, for anybody else that has that problem, they can just reach out to me, we'll figure it out. The reason we don't allow personal emails is because it's just typically very low in tech users that are coming to the website that are putting in personal emails.

Lenny (00:42:51):
Makes sense. I totally get it. I was not offended. I just like, all right. I had no way around it. That's the problem. So I like that you guys are adding some path around it and you're saying email you or reach out to you.

Sri Batchu (00:43:02):
You can find me on Twitter or email me. I'm just as sribatchu@ramp.

Lenny (00:43:06):
All right. You're going to have the most sales leads of any person at Ramp when this comes up. Okay. One other thing I wanted to touch on is success metrics. You talked about one of the keys to success and this repeatable growth engine is clear success metrics. Is there any just learnings and tips you have for people when they're thinking about success metrics?

Sri Batchu (00:43:26):
Finding the right success metric, there usually should be two. There should be one on volume and another one on efficiency. And we can talk about what are good efficiency metrics and what are good volume metrics. On volume, I think the right success metric has a couple things that are important. One is there's a clear linkage to value creation for the business. So if I move this metric that will drive revenue and which will drive equity value for the business or whatever it is that this particular. Metrics and for Facebook it was MAU, for Instacart, it was effectively monthly active orders, and it's something that we know is important that will really drive the value for the business, but it needs to have the other component of it, which is it's very intuitive for all of the people working internally to the company.

Sri Batchu (00:44:17):
And it's also clear, if they're working on some minutiae, how that can impact and actually move the main metric. So it's usually you have to find something that's somewhere in between, not too far, too lag, towards revenue and value creation, but also not something that's actually translatable to the efforts of various teams.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Is there an example of a good success metric that just comes to mind to make this a little bit concrete for people?

Sri Batchu (00:44:44):
It just depends on what goal at any given time is. Sometimes you're trying to drive more users, sometimes you're trying to drive more engagement and you can reorient the company on what you're trying to do as the north star for growth during that period of time. So users, obviously we've talked about as a good one. For engagement, I've often found what really helps is, and you've done actually really good benchmarking at some point, the escape velocity metric for growth for a company, I think.

Sri Batchu (00:45:15):
I don't think you phrased it that way, but that's [inaudible 00:45:18] for a given user, which is what does it take for somebody to become an engaged and active user or customer of a platform? And at Facebook, it was 10 friends the first seven days. At Instacart, it was three orders in the first month. And at Ramp, for our activation, I mean it's very specific to Ramp, but we've got four events that the customer needs to do in the first 30 days. And if they do that, they have a high likelihood of being activated and successful. So our activation team focuses on that.

Lenny (00:45:49):
The framework you just described reminds me Gibson Biddle has this really simple framework of gem where you can basically prioritize one of three things, growth, engagement, or monetization. And his advice is always just all of them are great, just make sure you're all aligned on which one matters most at the time.

Sri Batchu (00:46:06):
Yeah. And it is very similar to, we used to have this at Opendoor, and I think DoorDash also uses a similar framework, which is speed, quality, and cost. All three are important, but it's very hard to optimize all three at the same time. So you need to have a particular prioritization. And I think growth teams can also use that as, okay, I think the way I about the growth team's journey is step one is build a system that can move fast and then work on improving the quality and then work on optimization of cost after. So you pick which phase you're on because you can't do all three at the same time, whether it's growth, engagement, monetization, or just the other way of framing on it.

Lenny (00:46:49):
Speaking of metrics, I have this note here that you're a big fan of payback period for measuring investment ROI versus CAC. Can you talk about why that is?

Sri Batchu (00:47:02):
Yeah. CAC obviously gets thrown around a lot and a lot of people are like, "Okay, you have to be reducing your CAC, CAC, CAC, CAC." There's a fundamental flaw to it which obviously is that you're focusing on cost and not the value derived. And so when you focus on CAC and reducing CAC, what tends to happen is you actually might be doing something very damaging where you're succeeding in reducing CAC, but you're actually bringing in customers that are less valuable because those are the ones that you're able to attract with a lower CAC. And so reframing it away from CAC towards LTV is helpful and that's better. So thinking about for better customers that are bigger, we want to spend more. So you might think, okay, well, LTV to CAC might be a better way of looking at that. I think the challenge with LTV to CAC especially for a lot of, even Ramp, it's only four years old, is it's really hard to predict LTV.

Sri Batchu (00:47:57):
It's like a DCF, it's extremely assumption laden and it's hard to know what the final value will be. And especially if you think your churn is low and your LTV is very high, you might end up spending a lot of money because you're like, "Oh, my LTV to CAC is great." And then a year or two into the business, you realize actually your churn is higher than you thought. Your initial customers aren't representative of your long-term retention and all of a sudden you've destroyed a lot of value by looking at LTV to CAC, which is why I'm a big, big fan of payback period and actually being really thoughtful about that using contribution margin, not revenue or gross margin, like how long of contribution margin from this customer does it take to payback their cost? And setting this obviously is typically a mandate from the executive and board level on what is the payback period that we're comfortable with, and then just orienting everybody towards driving that blended payback period down as much as possible.

Lenny (00:48:56):
For folks that aren't familiar with the concept of payback period or contribution margin, could you just briefly describe what those mean for listeners?

Sri Batchu (00:49:01):
Yeah, so contribution margin is basically the profit that you make on a given customer after you take into account all of the variable costs. So including the cost of production as well as any other variable costs to serve that customer. So that might include support and other things that scale with your revenue. And then payback period is literally just how many months of that profit would it take to pay for? Let's say it costs you $5,000 to acquire this customer and your estimated profit per month on the customer is 500. That is a 10-month payback period. So as I say that, I'm sure you've heard, you still have to make assumptions for payback period, but at least they're more based in recency and you can evaluate them more quickly.

Lenny (00:49:49):
Awesome. Thank you for doing that. Just a couple more questions around growth specifically. So there's a lot of ways to grow through the history of a company. You can invest in SEO, you can invest in paid and sales and referrals and influencer marketing, brand marketing, billboards, all these things. Do you have an opinion on how to sequence these sorts of bets for a company, especially in B2B?

Sri Batchu (00:50:10):
Of course, a lot depends on who your customers are, what your unique value propositions are and how competitive the space that you're in. But I do think there's actually a general path that most B2B companies take and should take frankly, which is my view is you start off with founder-led sales, like the early team needs to know how to actually sell, then you hire your first couple of salespeople, then you start some very low cost targeted marketing efforts. So whether it's like content, community, small scale events, and then PR. After all of that is when you start paid and brand efforts. And then SEO probably start around the same time that you start paid marketing efforts.

Sri Batchu (00:50:56):
The reason for the progression the way I've described it is the channels get more expensive as you go farther along and they get more effective as you understand more about your customers and they're more scalable as well as you go farther along the list that I've described. And so that's the intention behind sequencing in that way. SEO is a bit unique. The reason I recommend it later rather than earlier, even though it's not necessarily that expensive, is just take some time to build. And without domain authority or backlinking or any media presence, you can end up just flailing with SEO, creating content and not getting any actual traction for a long time. So there's usually a good inflection point for your company to double down on SEO efforts. And it's somewhat a little bit later than some of the other times.

Lenny (00:51:43):
This touches on a great line that you have around experimentation where you talk about how you don't want to just fail fast with an experiment. You want to fail conclusively, if that's the word. Is that right? And then can you talk about that?

Sri Batchu (00:51:57):
Yeah, I talk a lot about that with my teams both here and other places, which is we celebrate failure. Growth experiments in my history are typically 30%-ish success rate. So the vast majority of things that you try don't work. And so you want to create a culture where people aren't afraid to take risks and aren't afraid to fail. And for me, failure is not that you didn't drive revenue, failure is not learning. So it's really important that you learn when you fail. And so we celebrate failure as long as you're learning and you can only learn if you've designed the right test and you failed conclusively because otherwise, I think many of us have been in situations where there's intuition that something might work and it doesn't work, and then you end up doing it over and over for years because every time a new executive or somebody else has the same idea, you try it again and it's because you haven't been able to design the test to fail conclusively, and it's hard to do.

Sri Batchu (00:53:00):
But at the end of the day, there's only two ways to make an experiment successful. Either you have a very large M or have a very significant treatment, which is what you're doing in the experiment itself. And in B2B, you don't usually have the luxury of large M, which you do in consumer. Facebook can get stats taken in two hours. A B2B company could take two years to get the same number of touch points. And so to counteract that, I recommend people just trying to maximize the treatment effect, which is if you have a hypothesis that you're testing, just throw all of the possible tactics and resources that you think would move that needle because you can always cost rationalize later if it works.

Sri Batchu (00:53:49):
And so just maximize the treatment effect. And if with all of that it didn't work, then you can say, "Hey, we're not going to try this again because we literally did try everything that we could to test this hypothesis." And if it doesn't work in the best version and it's expensive as it is, this is not worth spending more time on. But if it does work, great, then you do another version of the test with half the tactics or whichever tactics you think work better or worse and you optimize over time.

Lenny (00:54:17):
Is there an example you could share when you did that?

Sri Batchu (00:54:19):
I mean, account based marketing is something that is very common in enterprise software where you've selected certain customers that you think are high priority and you're saying, "I want to touch them in as many nuanced ways possible to see if that drives conversion." And this is something I've seen tried many times where people do it, but they do it halfway where they're like, "Okay, tried these three things. Conversion of the control group wasn't higher. And so we think this is not going to work."

Sri Batchu (00:55:00):
And then a new go-to market executive comes and they have to do it again. They have to do it again. They have to do it again. It's a very common one wherever this happens. And so when we did it at Ramp, we did exactly what I just described, which is let's really be thoughtful about the experiment design, both in terms of maximizing the number of people as well as maximizing the number of ways and types of ways that we're effectively touching these target customers to show the value one way or the other.

Lenny (00:55:31):
So what it sounds like is the hypothesis isn't like this email will have a big impact on conversion. It's like this strategy of coming after customers is what we're testing.

Sri Batchu (00:55:43):
That's the example there. And I think for example, this kind of framework is more important for cross-functional, larger scale, bigger tests rather than an email modification. But we could even use it on a micro example, like an email modification where you are like, okay, I think this particular email is underperforming because it's not talking to this part of the customer's pain point or journey or what have you. And the simplest test would be, okay, let me make some tweaks to the text and edit that, and that could be the end of that test.

Sri Batchu (00:56:24):
And if that doesn't work, you're like, "Oh, maybe those weren't the right text edits. Let me do a different text edits or whatever." And that's fine, that's low cost. It's not the end of the world for you to be wrong there. But an alternative that you could do is like, oh, what are all of the things that I could change about this email in the same test? Is it the trigger of the email? Is it the text content of the email? Is it additional personalization? Is it the design of the email? Trying to think of what are all of the various levers that you think could be wrong and put them all together to test your hypothesis of this touchpoint is wrong and how do I improve that.

Lenny (00:57:02):
Well, obviously the downside of that is if it doesn't work, you don't know if it's like, oh, maybe it was this thing could have worked in the subject-

Sri Batchu (00:57:08):
Yeah. So there's always trade-offs on this. But what you're hoping is you've done a complete refresh where you did all the things that you thought were intuitive that should work. And if it doesn't work, then you're like, "Okay, maybe my hypothesis is wrong." But you're right. There's always going to be a challenge if maybe the execution is wrong and I did too many things potentially in that case.

Lenny (00:57:29):
How does that go with the velocity culture? Is it just do those things real fast even though it's not like micro optimize, it's like go bigger but do them fast?

Sri Batchu (00:57:39):
Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I think it's important to frame where this matters. And so I think I'm less worried about failing conclusively for things that you can fail really, really fast and just redo, right? Things like website conversion, email, et cetera. I'm more worried about that for things that take a while to plan and cost money, et cetera.

Lenny (00:58:05):
Got it. Okay. Great. Maybe one last question around growth specifically. What are some of your favorite tools for the growth team, either internally, whatever you can share, or externally that just allow you to operate efficiently and effectively?

Sri Batchu (00:58:19):
A couple of things that we've used, I mean, one simple thing is for sprint planning, actually, we use Airtable because the planning process and the scoring is so much more analytical and the translation layer. So we've got a template on how we do our sprint planning and how we translate the various impact metrics into the common currency, which I enjoy, but I don't see it has to be Airtable. It's just some form of organization that works well for that. In terms of a very tactical growth tool that we've enjoyed recently is we used this company called Mutiny, which is also around customer, which is a tool for website copy, personalization. So they hook up with our third party data sources that we pay for, and based on what we know about the customer as they're landing on our page, we can personalize, copy, and design based on that. And that's had material impact and allowed us to scale website experimentation.

Lenny (00:59:18):
Amazing. And then are there internal tools you've built to help with experimentation or I don't know, sharing data, dashboard? I don't know, is there anything else that's just like, wow, this really helps us move fast?

Sri Batchu (00:59:27):
Eric, our CEO, has publicly talked about this. I think we as a company are very thoughtful about what we build in-house versus what we buy externally. I think a lot of engineering teams are often excited about building things in-house where there's off the shelf products that could basically work externally. And Ramp has historically been good at not falling into that trap. And we use third party tools for a lot of our growth and experimentation for things that are not proprietary, strategic, et cetera, obviously. Some of the automation stuff that we've talked about, we've built all of that in-house in terms of prospecting, lead scoring, and how we talk to our customers. But for the most part, we use external tools. Instacart and Opendoor were not like that. We built our own internal experiment tracking systems, A/B testing frameworks and all of that in-house.

Lenny (01:00:25):
That's what I would've guessed about Ramp that it's with speed, you got to not build stuff you don't have to build. So that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Maybe one last topic to talk about. I want to talk about hiring. You have some really interesting approaches to how to think about hiring. One is I think you have a really interesting strategy for how to find the best companies and also the best people at each of those companies to go after if you're hiring for specific role. Can you talk about how you think about that?

Sri Batchu (01:00:51):
Gokul on Twitter has talked about some of those, which is there's two ways to go about hiring great people. One way is basically a very thoughtful and tactical network search where let's say you're hiring for a head of SEO, you go ask your network of who is the best SEO person you know, get introduction to each of those folks, and then ask them who the best person that they know is. And you have a mapping of where are the best SEO teams and why. If you can't get one of those people, 20, 30 people on your target list, you go down the list of, okay, what is the next best person? And you typically want to limit it to companies that are one to two stages of growth after you. So you want somebody that has seen your stage of growth and beyond at a company that has a reputation for craft and the field that you're looking for. So that's a very classic way of doing that, and I think that works really well for people and companies that are really well-connected.

Sri Batchu (01:01:56):
So there's another approach that I've actually used successfully is much more kind of data driven and external and not as network based, which is you can often look up data. [inaudible 01:02:14] is a lot of it is somewhat public, right? So you can look up information on which companies might be doing well. So for example, I'll just pick like if you're looking for great email marketing folks like CRM marketing lead or something like that, you can actually look up on similar web, what percentage of traffic shows up via email to companies websites. So you've got your target list of companies that are one or two stage beyond you that you respect as general companies. And you can go and see, okay, which ones of these are actually really effective at driving web traffic or app traffic or app downloads via their email. And then go try to source from those teams and companies. And I think people under-utilize that even though it's very intuitive, it's just not something that occurs to people to do.

Lenny (01:03:03):
I love that. I've not heard that tip right there. The first piece, Google definitely recommends this, and I think the core part of that is the core theme here is find the companies that are the best at the thing you're trying to hire for, and then figure out who at the company is the best once you start talking to people. I love it. Another strong opinion that I think you have is around paying people and how much to pay the best. Can you talk about that?

Sri Batchu (01:03:30):
Yeah, I think there's a lot of conversation around compensation is very much focused on equality and narrowing the gap and bands for compensation. And I think personally, I know it's a bit of a spicy take maybe, but I think it's the exact opposite direction of the conversation that companies should be having about compensation, which is I strongly, strongly believe that small teams of successful people can drive a lot more impact than larger teams of mediocre people.

Sri Batchu (01:04:05):
And so I strongly believe you have to design a system where you're able to reward 10X operators with 10X the comp. You certainly see that at the executive level. So if you look at the same executive at different companies at similar stages, the comp can be widely different based for a variety of reasons. But one of them is the perception of performance and potential by the management team. And I think people need to be thinking about how to do that across more levels, which is if you can do that, and if you do that well, I think you're able to differentially hire and retain the best talent. And that'll be a great competitive advantage for companies that can do that well.

Lenny (01:04:48):
And do you think about this within a team pay the best people the most, or is it more only hire these 10X people and then pay everyone the most?

Sri Batchu (01:04:58):
People think of the talent density of your company as dependent on hiring. And that's obviously true. It's an important part of the ecosystem and the first part, but it's equally dependent on retention and performance management. A lot of companies can be good at hiring, but hiring has pretty high rate of false positive. Interview is the worst, best way to hire somebody. And then there's lots of ways you can make the interviewing process better, make it more interactive, make it more effective, but at the end of the day, you still don't know about someone until you really work closely with the new team, with the new mandate at your company.

Sri Batchu (01:05:40):
So I think it's not about necessarily hiring [inaudible 01:05:44] operators, obviously you're looking for that, but it's also about investing in people that are doing really well and accelerating their growth and rewards based on impact once they're there and as well as managing out people directly that didn't work out. And I typically think it's almost never when I've had to part ways with people is because someone's a bad actor. It's almost always that it just wasn't the right fit for whatever reason, for their skillset, for their life goals or whatever it may be. And it just wasn't a fit for that role. And I think a lot of companies are hesitant to make those changes, and I think that's how they bring their talent bar down, frankly.

Lenny (01:06:28):
Absolutely agree. Sri, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Sri Batchu (01:06:35):
I don't know how many people will use this. I'm still surprised when new folks come to me and it's like I need to write, by the way, a document of how do you work with me? Because I know it's a lot of people have been talking about, I think [inaudible 01:06:51] Johnson's talked about it too, but I say that my love languages are spreadsheets and frameworks. And one very simple one that I've always liked that sometimes people surprised to hear, but it's most consultants know is what we call MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhausted set of things. So whenever you're trying to attack a problem and trying to brainstorm solutions or what have you, I really like to remind the teams to think about MECE because when you think about that and evaluate your set of solutions with that framework in mind, I think you tend to find that you've catch more potential solutions and also you'll feel comfortable that you've been comprehensive in your solution development. So anyway, just a little thing for people that are earlier in their careers to not forget.

Lenny (01:07:46):
So let's make it a little bigger than a little thing. So MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. Is there an example of what that may look like and or visualize for people to think about what this means in practice?

Sri Batchu (01:08:00):
Yeah. I mean, I'll give it really dumb example, but that will make the point hopefully. It's like, okay, our profitability or our revenue growth has slowed down is the problem that you're trying to solve. And so okay, you start with, okay, what does this mean? You've got revenue per user has gone down, or customer has gone down, or number of customers have slowed down. Okay, that's step one of the MECE framework. Then it's like, okay, where does the revenue come from? What are all the various products that revenue could be coming from? Has it changed on any one of them? And then customers, why have customers gone down? Is it new customer acquisition? Is it activation of customers that have signed up? Is it retention? And just breaking that problem. So at each layer you've collectively exhausted all of the possible ways that this problem could have arrived. And just having that framework whenever you approach every problem will prevent you from missing something important. And also just more generally give you an others' confidence that you're being comprehensive in your solution development.

Lenny (01:09:11):
Got it. So one way to think about this in this specific case is just make a formula of all of the variables that play into the question you're trying to answer.

Sri Batchu (01:09:19):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:09:20):
Awesome. Well, Sri, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Sri Batchu (01:09:26):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:09:28):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Sri Batchu (01:09:32):
I tend to find most business books can be decks, but one that I really like actually is Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss. It's a negotiation book, find it super helpful for negotiation, but also for a lot of business decision making generally, to be honest, and life. And then I'm a big fan of sci-fi short stories, so anything by Ted Chiang or Ken Liu, I highly recommend.

Lenny (01:09:57):
I love those both. On the first one I'm actually in the process of listening to it on audio and every time I'm in a place where I can negotiate something, I never remember anything that I've learned. Is there one thing that you've taken away from that book that stuck with you of like I use this?

Sri Batchu (01:10:11):
I think that the core of the book really is about listening behind the problem of negotiation and what is the person really asking for. So his example of if you're always trying to split things evenly, you'll end up with one brown shoe, one black shoe, where neither of you are happy. And so rather than thinking about BATNA and ZOPA and all the other business school frameworks on negotiation, I think focus on deep down what does this other person want and how can I change the conversation about that rather than the thing that we're arguing over.

Lenny (01:10:47):
Awesome. Great. Next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Sri Batchu (01:10:51):
I mean, obviously it won the Oscar, but I really enjoyed Everything Everywhere All at Once. I thought it was such a wonderful story and really I think it's one of those... It's funny. The movie can also be, I think, everything because there are just so many different reads that you can get about that. It's about family, it's about immigration, it's about love. There's a lot of really interesting themes explored via one movie.

Lenny (01:11:19):
What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?

Sri Batchu (01:11:21):
I was going to say, oh, I like to ask other people.

Lenny (01:11:24):
You like to ask. What did you think I was going to ask?

Sri Batchu (01:11:26):
Oh, I thought what was my favorite interview question that you've asked or others have asked?

Lenny (01:11:30):
Oh, I got to clarify this. Both are acceptable answers.

Sri Batchu (01:11:37):
I was going to cheat on that one and say the one that you asked me right before, because I'm a big fan of actually movies and TV shows and people rarely ask about that interviews like this, but favorite interview that I'd like to ask candidates actually is what's something that you're really bad at but you still do and why?

Lenny (01:11:58):
What do you look for in their answer when you ask them?

Sri Batchu (01:12:01):
Yeah, a lot of people actually struggle with that question and can't answer anything that they do that they're bad at, which is a little bit of a yellow flag, which means that they're only used to doing things that they're successful at and they haven't cultivated interests that are not correlated to their own success at doing something. And they haven't taken the time to do that. And folks like that are going to run at the first sign of trouble and be like, "Oh, I'm not successful at this, so I'm going to move on." And what I really want to see is people that show examples of things that they're not successful at that they do for other motivations and goals and interests. And so if you can tell me a compelling story like that, it's usually a winning answer so to speak.

Lenny (01:12:43):
What is a favorite product or two that you've recently discovered that you love?

Sri Batchu (01:12:46):
Carrie mentioned Eight Sleep once in this call. I love my Eight Sleep. I'm a big fan and they're Ramp customers as well. And so that's been a great pandemic purchase. So I guess maybe not as recent. And then maybe another one is Fellow coffee, their kettles I think just designed so beautifully. I don't drink coffee, I drink tea, but I use my Fellow kettle for tea, and I think it's just a delightful product to use.

Lenny (01:13:15):
I got a Fellow kettle from my tea also, and I found that the flow of the water was too slow and it's just standing here pouring this pour over.

Sri Batchu (01:13:24):
Yeah. Yeah. So they do have a non-pour over kettle, which is what I have, which makes it easier.

Lenny (01:13:29):
Okay. My mistake. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that you found to have a big impact on your ability to execute?

Sri Batchu (01:13:42):
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if this is minor or not, but one of the things that on the growth side, we used to have separate sprint planning for the product team, for the marketing teams, and each team had their own planning cycles. And one of the things that we did is we brought them all together into one. So the lifecycle marketers joined the product activation team sprint cycles, and so their projects and work are very tightly aligned and work in the same pace and system as the rest of the product team. And that's had tremendous impact in our ability to work together.

Lenny (01:14:19):
Final question, Ramp is all about helping people save money. I'm curious if you have any tips on just saving money.

Sri Batchu (01:14:26):
I mean, it seems obvious, and I think I feel like negotiation's already been the theme of this lightning round, but everything is negotiable when it comes to contracts. People think contracts are standardized for software and usually not. People are trying to sell you something they're trying to grow too. They have their quotas to meet, they have their goals to hit. So I mean, Ramp obviously has a service for this if you wanted to scale these Ramps, but you can do this on your own. Always try to negotiate, be mindful of quarter ends for salespeople. And so if you can push something out till near the end of the quarter, you can ask for, "Hey, I'll sign it by the end of the month if you give me a 10% discount," will often work. So there's tips like that you can do, but remember that you can always negotiate.

Sri Batchu (01:15:10):
And then the second one is, I would say is just hire slower. I'm a big believer in, and Geoff talks about this too in your other interview, hiring based on slope rather than intercept, I think will work well for you and only hiring when people and teams are really stretched. I think this will serve you well both on cost and on impact. There'll be plenty of scope for the people that you hire, and as I said, I'm a big believer in small teams accomplishing more like Ramp being like a fraction of the size of some of our competitors with similar orders of revenue.

Lenny (01:15:47):
Sure. We've covered velocity, growth, hiring. So many topics, everything I was hoping we touch on. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

Sri Batchu (01:15:59):
Yeah, I'm a big fan of the fun place of the cesspool of Twitter, so I have a public Twitter account that you can DM me. My DMs are open, it's just my name's sri_batchu. And in terms of listeners can be useful, honestly, I think I really enjoy meeting like-minded folks, and as I may have mentioned in other places, Ramp is growing incredibly well and we're constantly looking to hire and we're still hiring. So if you know best in class growth in marketing folks that they can recommend that we hire at Ramp, I'd love to hear.

Lenny (01:16:40):
And I think the URL is ramp.com/careers. I just pulled it up.

Sri Batchu (01:16:43):
Yep, that's it. Thank you.

Lenny (01:16:47):
All right, Sri, well thank you again so much for being here and for sharing so much.

Sri Batchu (01:16:49):
Yeah, of course. Thank you.

# Mental models for building products people love ft. Stewart Butterfield

## Transcript

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:00):
This is 2014. That was the year that Slack actually launched. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, "I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public."

(00:00:14):
To me that was like, "You should be embarrassed." If you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Slack was famous for being one of the early, consumerized B2B SaaS products.

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:29):
At more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers, and you can put effort into demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Something else I heard that you often espouse is friction in a product experience is actually often a good thing?

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:52):
It became an assumption that it should always be trying to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension. If your software stops me and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. If people could get over the idea of reducing friction as a number of goal or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something, and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
You started two companies, both famously pivoted. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting.

Stewart Butterfield (00:01:20):
The decision is about have you exhausted the possibilities? Creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):
Today, my guest is Stewart Butterfield, a founder and product legend who rarely does podcasts. Stewart founded Flickr and then Slack, which he sold to Salesforce in one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history at the time. There is so much product and leadership wisdom locked away in his head. I feel like our conversation just scratched the surface. We chat about utility curves, something he calls the owner's delusion, a hilarious pattern he sees at companies he calls hyperrealistic work-like activities, what he's learned about product and craft and taste and Parkinson's law, why you need to obsess with not making your users think, the backstory on his legendary we don't sell saddles here memo, and so much more. A huge thank you to Noah Weiss, Chris Cordell, Ali Rael, and Johnny Rogers for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation. This is a really special one and I really hope to have Stewart back to delve even deeper.

(00:02:57):
Here's a puzzle for you. What do OpenAI, Cursor, Perplexity, Vercel, Plaid and hundreds of other winning companies have in common? The answer is they're all powered by today's sponsor, WorkOS. If you're building software for enterprises, you've probably felt the pain of integrating single sign-on, SCIM, RBAC, audit logs, and other features required by big customers. WorkOS turns those deal blockers into drop-in APIs with a modern developer platform built specifically for B2B SaaS.

(00:03:26):
Whether you're a seed-stage startup trying to land your first enterprise customer or a unicorn expanding globally, WorkOS is the fastest path to becoming enterprise-ready and unlocking growth.

WorkOS allows you to build like the best with delightful APIs, comprehensive docs, and a smooth developer experience. Go to workos.com to make your app enterprise-ready today.

(00:03:58):
This episode is brought to you by Metronome. You just launched your new shiny AI product. The new pricing page looks awesome, but behind it, last-minute glue code, messy spreadsheets, and running ad hoc queries to figure out what to bill. Customers get invoices they can't understand. Engineers are chasing billing bugs. Finance can't close the books. With Metronome, you hand it all off to the real-time billing infrastructure that just works. Reliable, flexible, and built to grow with you. Metronome turns raw usage events into accurate invoices, gives customers bills they actually understand and keeps every team in sync in real-time. Whether you're launching usage-based pricing, managing enterprise contracts, or rolling out new AI services, Metronome does the heavy lifting so that you can focus on your product, not your billing. That's why some of the fastest growing companies in the world like OpenAI and Anthropic run their billing on Metronome. Visit metronome.com to learn more. That's metronome.com.

(00:04:59):
Stewart, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Stewart Butterfield (00:05:02):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
I'm even more excited. I'm so honored to have you here. I never told you this, but you've been towards the very top of my wish list of guests I have on this podcast ever since I started this podcast a few years ago, so I'm very excited that we're finally making this happen. I have so many questions for you. My first question is just what the heck are you up to these days? I feel like ever since you left Slack, we haven't heard much from Stewart. I'm curious what you're up to you hopefully or just chilling.

Stewart Butterfield (00:05:28):
I'm mostly just chilling. I left Salesforce two and a half years ago and I have a two and a half year old, so she was actually born three days after my last day, so a lot of time with family and it's an enormous privilege to be able to spend time with young kids while they're young. No new company to announce or anything like that. I do get a lot of emails and texts. Basically every three to six weeks there's this cycle because Cal Henderson who's the CTO of Slack and who also, we worked together on Flickr, so have worked together now for 23 years, have been talking about what we want to do next if there is something.

(00:06:10):
But honestly, the big challenge has been I think these things are destroying the world and what we're good at is making software. So you find some way to make software that helped people use their phones less often, then that would be a big winner, but haven't come up with anything good. A lot of philanthropic work, nothing to announce there yet, but there's some cool projects that I'm working on, and a lot of just personal creative art projects and supporting other artists and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):
To prep for this chat, I talked to so many people that have worked with you over the years to try to figure out what you taught them about building product, building teams, building companies that most stuck with them, that most helped them build amazing products. The first is a concept called utility curves. This came up a bunch across so many people that have worked with you. Talk about what is a utility curve, how you use that to build better products.

Stewart Butterfield (00:07:08):
This is pretty easy because it's a very familiar S-curve where you have, it's flat and it starts arcing up and then there's a really steep part and then it levels off again. And on the horizontal axis, you can think of cost or effort and on the vertical axis, it's value or convenience. It depends exactly what you're talking about, but the idea is the first bit of effort you put into something doesn't result in a huge amount of value. And then there's some magic threshold where it produces an enormous amount of value and then continued investment doesn't really pay off. The most basic example I can think of is let's say you're making a hammer, and on that bottom axis, it's now quality, and if the hammer has a handle that breaks with any impact, then is totally useless. And if you make it a little bit stronger, it's still pretty useless and it's like junk, junk, junk, junk, junk. Okay, good, great. Then it doesn't matter anymore.

(00:08:06):
If you're making an app, okay, this app's going to have users and so let's make a user's table and a database, and so far you have generated no value. The reason I felt like this was so important is because we would talk about a feature, and usually features are thought of as a binary. You either have this feature or you don't. The argument I guess was have we just not invested enough in this or have we got all the value or convenience or quality or whatever that we could get out of this? And we had pointed diminishing returns and it just doesn't matter.

(00:08:46):
I think in many cases, people will add a feature, it's not good enough and so people don't use it or appreciate it, but now you've added some complexity to the app and then people give up or take it back or they try something in testing and they don't get the results they want, and so they decide that this a thing is worth doing. We would try to really investigate and decide whether we were on the first shallow part of the curve, the second shallow part of the curve, or we're just coming up to it. So I think it's a lot easier to understand the value of this when you're talking about a specific app and a specific feature, but I think it was ultimately helpful in getting people to understand whether something was worth it or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):
So just to mirror back what I'm hearing, there's this, if you visualize this curve at the bottom, it's like I don't even know what this is. And then up the curve is like, okay, I sort of get it. And then at the top is, okay, I can't live without this now that I understand what this is for, it feels like it's a really a different way of thinking about getting to the aha moment for someone where they see, okay, saved items, I get it, I need to use this constantly. It feels like this works both for a specific feature and also just for Slack, getting people to even understand here's what Slack can do for you. And then now I can't live without Slack. And essentially this is a lens you use to figure out where to spend product resources because if you don't get up that curve to I get it and I can't live without it, nothing else matters. Is that the framework?

Stewart Butterfield (00:10:13):
Yeah, and I think then you layer on another concept like the, Bezos used the term divine discontent. The line actually moves because once people are familiar with a piece of software or the way a feature is implemented or something like that, their standards go up, and so there's this competition. And again, this axis can be, utility is the best general term for it, but it could be quality, convenience, speed, it could be any number of things, but as you improve your search capability or as you improve your login experience or your forget password experience or your checkout experience or whatever everyone else is as well. And so there's this continued investment and when forget about thinking about a new feature, you're looking at how the product works overall and usually things get implemented once, and then if they're lucky, they get improved upon periodically. Most things get improved upon very infrequently and some things get improved upon never.

(00:11:22):
I want to give an example at the absolute extreme because I actually don't know how long this has been, but I try not to criticize other people's software so much because I'm very familiar with the trade-offs and prioritization and how hard it can be and blah, blah, blah, blah. But okay, so most people have the Gmail Calendar app on their phone. I travel a fair bit. I'm mostly in the Eastern Time Zone, sometimes in Mountain Time, sometimes in Pacific, sometimes in English time, and sometimes in Japan, Central Europe. There's maybe 10 time zones, 12 time zones that I would ever choose. When you hit the option to set the time zone on an event in Google Calendar, on the iOS app, it presents all the time zones in the world in alphabetical order. And I mean, there's probably worse orderings, but there's no value in that.

(00:12:24):
And even when you start searching, it still presents them in alphabetical order by country with that turn. So if I'm in California and I'm trying to set the appointment for next week when I'm back in New York and I type in E-A-S-T and I get a bunch of garbage, okay, Eastern, and then the first one is Eastern Australia, New South Wales, and then Eastern Australia, Queensland, and then Eastern Australia, Daylight Savings and Eastern Australia standard time. And then you're like, "Well, fuck, I can't remember which one is Daylight Savings and which one is standard time?" I could keep going like this for a while. This is an app that's used by at least hundreds of millions of people, presumably every single Google employee. It's bananas how bad it is. There's so many, there's all these clever things you could do. Like you know me, I'm on the West Coast, first option should be the East Coast and vice versa. But it definitely shouldn't be that every time zone is presented with equal value. I don't a couple hundred time zones. I grew up in Canada. Newfoundland has its own time zone, which is offset by half an hour. The population of Newfoundland has about half a million people. Not that many people go to visit Newfoundland, maybe a million people in all of history so like a million and a half out of 8 billion people. And there's Newfoundland, the same with China time, which is like 25% of the world's population in this.

(00:13:51):
Anyway, that was a little bit longer than I intended to go on this example, but it's crazy because no one's going to switch to Gmail or to G Suite, Google Calendar from Outlook Exchange because the time zone picker is good, so maybe in some sense it doesn't matter, but at the same time there's a real value in delighting customers and there's an emotional connection that they form or don't form. And in some cases that could be really positive like they would recommend it. And when they switch companies or decide to start their own company, they're going to choose to use this product or advocate for it because of that emotional connection and vice versa.

(00:14:34):
They'll also be like, "I hate this thing that drives me bananas. I really think we should stop using it," or advocate for the alternative. And I think people just don't appreciate or come back to those things often enough. And then there's this category of really essential parts of the app again like account creation, sign up, forgot password, things like that, that for most organizations very infrequently get a lot of love and iteration and improvement despite the fact that the quality bar has gone up across the board and continually goes up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
Let's go down that rabbit hole a little bit more around delight and craft. Slack was famous for being one of the early, let's say consumerized B2B SaaS products. Slack leaned into delight and experience and craft and a great experience. And you just as a product leader, I'd say are known as very taste forward, very craft oriented leader, which is pretty rare and I think continues to be rare. So there's a few things I want to talk about here. One is taste. I heard at a talk, you gave a talk on taste and you have a really unique perspective on just what taste is, what product taste looks like. Can you share that?

Stewart Butterfield (00:15:49):
There is a lot of you going back to the utility curves again, people who are obsessed with this one little thing and keep on adding more and more detailed improvements beyond the point where it makes much of a difference. But I guess a couple of things about taste. So one is can you learn to develop it? I think so because the word literally comes from experiencing food and putting stuff in your mouth. And can people become better chefs with training? Yes, absolutely. Undoubtedly, some people have a natural advantage and are born with this ability to make discernments that are difficult for other people to make and stuff like that. But you can definitely practice and you can definitely get better. The second thing I'd say is you can create a real advantage for yourself, for your product, for your company by leaning into it because most people don't have good taste and don't invest. You're probably familiar with, again, Jeff Bezos line, your margin is my opportunity and pretty obvious what he meant by that.

(00:16:54):
I would tell the story at Slack over and over again. It actually made it part of the new hire welcome. I'm in Vancouver at our Vancouver office and I'm going for a walk with Brandon Velestuk who's our, at the time creative director for product development, I think that was his title. And we're in the Yaletown neighborhood in Vancouver so there's really narrow sidewalks because it used to be a warehouse district and now it's fancy restaurants and nail salons and boutiques and stuff. And as it does in Vancouver, it starts to rain. We don't have umbrellas. We're walking back to the office and most people have umbrellas and we're on these narrow sidewalks with people coming towards us with umbrellas. We noticed how few people would move their umbrella out of the way. And of course, the other person, their umbrella, the pokey bits are exactly at eye level for people walking towards them. We would get forced off the sidewalk or having to duck down or whatever.

(00:17:54):
It became a game like we were guessing is this person going to tilt their umbrella out of the way so we can pass or not? And something like one-third of the people would do it. And we had this conversation about it where it's like, okay, I can think of three reasons why people wouldn't do it. One is they have very few avenues in their life to exercise power and this is one of them. And they're just, want to get out there and dominate people and cause suffering. Shouldn't ascribe to malice that which can be ascribed to ignorance so that probably is the explanation for a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of people.

(00:18:34):
But the other two explanations aren't that great either. One is that they see it's happening, they see they're pushing other people off the sidewalk or poking them in the eye or whatever, and they're just like, "Fuck, that's too bad. I wish there was something I could do about that, but I can't think of anything." And the last reason is they just don't notice it all. They're just oblivious to their impact on other people. And they're so in their head, and I can't really think of any other explanations for it besides that.

(00:19:03):
And so we would say it's not like tilting your umbrella is our opportunity. That's not a great rephrase of your margin is my opportunity, but your failure to really be consider it exercise this courtesy and really be empathic about other people's experience is an advantage that you can create a critical advantage. I think that there's many reasons why Slack was successful at the moment. It was successful and we think we had a bunch of really wonderful tailwinds and all of that stuff, but it wouldn't have grown the way it did without those little conveniences which caused people to form an emotional connection because a lot of our growth came from startup A uses Slack, and then someone leaves startup A for startup B, and startup B doesn't use Slack yet. And they would be like, "Oh my God, you guys, you really, this is so good. We got to try it." And the spread was driven by that and people really genuinely advocating for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):
That is an amazing metaphor. I love that one moment became a value of product craftsmanship at Slack.

Stewart Butterfield (00:20:14):
Tilt your umbrella was a very common saying on company swag and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there an example, I imagine there are many, but from the time of building Slack, especially in the early days where you chose to go big on craftsmanship and experience and delight versus speed where you thought looking back that was a really great idea and worth really core just to success.

Stewart Butterfield (00:20:37):
Here's a bunch of little examples. Someone else came up with this idea, and I'm trying to remember who it was, but let's see, maybe Andrea Torres, maybe Ben Brown, something like that who was like, "Why did we ask people for email address and password if their ownership of the email address was the thing that allowed them to create the account in the first place? Why don't we just ask them for their email address and then send them a link?"

(00:21:07):
And so when Slack's first version of the mobile app came out, we're like, "Typing your password on your phone if you have any minimal threshold of password hygiene is a terrible experience." Capital H, lowercase Q, six, caret, period. So let's just have them enter the email address. We'll send them a link. The link will automatically open the app and authenticate them. And so there's one, a little example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:33):
Wow. So you guys invented the magic link experience.

Stewart Butterfield (00:21:36):
Someone else invented. I want to be clear that I had seen that idea somewhere else, someone else, a blog post about it or something like that. But we were the first ones, to my knowledge, that really scaled that and made it a standard. There is another one which we really puzzled about in the very early days where people have a long history of using messaging apps from AOL Instant Messenger to SMS to WhatsApp, where their expectation is they get a notification for every message that's received. And in the case of Slack, that doesn't make as much sense because you're a member of many channels and the messages may not be for you, and so that's why we have the @ tagging people. And we certainly didn't invent that, that was Twitter.

(00:22:23):
But what we realized was people were signing up for Slack, and it's one engineer on this team inside of this larger organization, inside this larger company, and they would pull in the person next to them and they would say, "Let's try it out."

(00:22:35):
And then they would send a message and then one person would be like, "I didn't get a notification. This is bullshit."

(00:22:43):
We reluctantly decided that we had to send notifications for every single message as the default for new accounts. But once you had, I don't remember what the threshold would happen, I think it's once you had received 10 messages, we would pop up this little thing that says, "Hey, you have our default settings for notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our-"

Stewart Butterfield (00:23:00):
... For notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our recommended settings? And then they would just click a link and it would have what should be the default, which is, you only get a notification if it's a DM or someone tags you. But we realized it was worth that investment to get people over the hump. I'll give one more simple one and then one kind of more complex. One, people would just like the, I can't remember if it's called urgent or important, but the flag in Outlook, set the priority of a message for the recipients always got abused inside of every company. As soon as someone does it, everyone's like, "Okay, I'm going to do that too for my message."

(00:23:41):
And so all of your messages have the little flag and it becomes useless. We have @everyone, which causes a notification to be sent to every member of the channel when the message is sent and people would start, someone would find this feature inside of a organization. They would @everyone, everyone would get a notification and then the next person to send a message who was like, " Well, my thing's more important than Bob's thing. I'm going to also @everyone." And it became really obnoxious and people would complain about it, but it was, I don't know, I guess tragedy of the commons. It's not quite exactly the same thing, but it was this real dynamic that happened over and over again.

(00:24:16):
So we came up with what was called the shouty rooster, and internally we said, "Don't be a cock." But we didn't obviously say that publicly when you @everyone, a little rooster would pop up and it would have you sound waves coming out of its mouth and being really obnoxious and say, "Hey, this is going to cause a notification for 147 people in eight different time zones. Are you sure you want to send this message with the @everyone?" And of course, that worked amazingly and it dropped off. And again, it was really trying to shape people's behavior so that they used, one is not to be very flexible, but we knew that there was ways to use it that would be annoying and difficult for everyone. And so try to shape the communication culture inside the organization to take best advantage on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That feature still exists. I see that rooster all the, no, I don't see it all, well, actually I do @channel, because I run a big Slack, so I see that rooster, that survived.

Stewart Butterfield (00:25:11):
Yeah. Yeah, that survived and good because it was a trivially easy thing to implement and made a really big difference. But it also taught people how the product worked, because people probably didn't know that @everyone or @channel... Didn't think about the cost, at least.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:31):
Genius.

Stewart Butterfield (00:25:32):
Yeah. Here's one more. So we decided we were going to Do Not Disturb as a feature. And we had this, not conundrum, but you're trying to take into account all the different uses of Slack because by the time we implemented this, 2017, there was tens of thousands of paying customers, the organizations, hundreds of probably millions of users, maybe hundreds of thousands of organizations. I don't remember how many. And everyone had set up stuff the way that they liked it, including things like ops alerts going into channels for on-call engineers for some of the biggest systems and apps in the world. And so we couldn't just deploy it right away. We realized that some of the decision-makers, the owners of the organizations were going to have really strong opinions about this. We also realized that some of the end users are going to have strong opinions, and we wanted to figure out a way to balance the concerns and give people appropriate means of control.

(00:26:37):
So we came up with this really elaborate system for the rollout, which was, we told everyone, I'm sorry, every Slack administrator that this was coming weeks before it came. And we told them that we were going to set a default for their organization, which I believe was either 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. in their local time zone, or 8: 00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M., I can't remember which it was, but also that they could override that default, and also that the individual end users could override that system owner default. And finally, that the system owner could, if they changed the default again, would override all of the end user's preferences and then the end users could override them again. And it wasn't to create this dynamic where people were at war, but so that you could change a policy and then people could still customize and stuff like that.

(00:27:32):
But this was a much longer and more convoluted process, but it allowed the millions of people who were using Slack to get the feature without creating a bunch of conflict and without people turning it off automatically. And I think critically, with setting a bunch of defaults, because if we didn't set the default, most people wouldn't turn it on at all. If we didn't default you to Do Not Disturb from 8:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M. you probably, if you're the average person, wouldn't ever do it yourself. So that's another elaborate example where I think that investment made sense because it was a critical feature for a lot of people. And if we hadn't done it that way, I think it would've caused a lot of complaints and conflict and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:22):
Those are amazing examples. I very much appreciate that Do Not Disturb feature when you guys launched that. I still remember that coming out. I'm sure a lot of people are very thankful for that.

Stewart Butterfield (00:28:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:31):
Something else I heard that you often espouse, which is counterintuitive to a lot of people is about friction, friction in the product experience. That friction is actually often a good thing. It's a feature, not a bug a lot of times if you use it well. Talk about your experience there.

Stewart Butterfield (00:28:46):
Yeah. So yes, and there's also another issue around friction, which is it became like a mantra or just kind of an assumption that you should always be trying to remove friction. And in some cases that's true. We would talk about it in Slack. It was hard to market. It was hard to explain what it was if you had never used it before. You could say a messaging app for businesses or whatever, but a critical disadvantage to Slack doing out-of-home advertising, putting up a billboard versus beer or cars is, no one needs to be explained why they would want a car or beer, but everyone will have to explain one day why they want Slack. And so the problem there is comprehension, and this will come up an enormous amount. So now imagine you want to get tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in San Francisco and you go to the Ticketmaster website.

(00:29:43):
If you think about both your comprehension, it's perfect to this case. And that translates into the specificity of your intent and the degree of your intent is also kind of maxed out. So look, I really want to get these tickets. I know exactly what they are. They're Taylor Swift tickets for this date at this venue. And so in that scenario, it doesn't really matter if Ticketmaster's website is slow, it doesn't really matter if the payments page errors out, you're going to persist and get through it. So obviously they're better to reduce friction, but in some sense there's not a huge amount of value in doing that. For most creators of products, there are a handful of cases where that really is true for you as well. And they include things like user registration, authentication, checkout flows for e-commerce. I am significantly more likely to buy something if there's Apple Pay or Shop Pay or something like that.

(00:30:44):
I'm significantly less likely to carry through the purchase of something if I have to manually enter all of the fields of my address one at a time rather than having one of those address pickers. It's crazy, but the issue is my intent isn't always 100%, and the specificity of my intent isn't always 100%. So if your thing is direct to consumer T-shirts and you acquire customers through Instagram ads, all of them know what T-shirts are. It's like, "This looks like a good T-shirt to me." But I'm rarely 100% intent. I might have a very specific intent, but my intent's like 70%. So if you're, the amount of friction is above that, I'm not going to do it. But now, okay, people coming to Slack.com, some friend had mentioned Slack and talked their ear off at some point months ago, and then they saw a news article and then they saw someone's tweet and then they saw an ad on about the website they were visiting and they finally said, "Okay, I'm going to go to this website."

(00:31:46):
So their intent is at the absolute minimum threshold, it was before that last event happened, they were below and now they're above, but they're just above. The specificity of their intent like, "I need to get Taylor Swift concerts for this date at this venue." Is also very low, because they're like, "It's a work thing. I'm not sure it's a spreadsheet or a calendar or exactly what it is." So they were coming in at 0.1% over these critical thresholds. What was the challenge? It wasn't friction, because it's not like they were aiming for something and they knew what they were aiming for and they were just trying to get themselves to that point.

(00:32:34):
What we had to worry about was creating comprehension and in two senses, what is this thing? And what am I supposed to do next? And that creation of comprehension in the sense of explaining stuff, that creation of comprehension in the sense of the design of the UI, of the screen, of the page or whatever, and the visual hierarchy and the affordances that are there and the indication of things to interact with and which thing should be the next thing to do and all that stuff, that becomes really critical.

(00:33:09):
And I think very, very few people recognize that. They're like, "I want to get people who come to my webpage to the sign up form as quickly as possible." But if they don't know what they're signing up for and they don't know what it's going to do after, is it going to spam them? They don't know, "Am I going to have to pay on the next step or what?" Then they're just going to back out. And this was a lifelong battle because the remove friction orientation is so deep in people. Again, it really makes a difference in those cases where people do have an intent and they do know what they're trying to do is a poor approach when the challenge is really comprehension, and I think the secret is most, 70%, 80% or whatever of a product design is in that comprehension step because people, if they do ever open the preferences tab and look at all the options, rarely have an idea.

(00:34:09):
And if you can't teach them or make it possible for them to discover what the capabilities are, then they're not going to take advantage of them and they're not going to get as much out of it. And I think that the trick is for most of the unique parts of any application, most of the specific things that your app, your product, your software does are areas where the challenge is going to be comprehension inside of friction. It really could be anything Shopify, the purpose of the service for its end users is generally going to be kind to clear. But most people, most first-time store openers don't know that they can get reports or if they know that they can get reports, they don't know what kinds of reports. And if they know what kinds of reports they can get, they don't know how they can tweak them and what the timing should be and which things that are more important to display.

(00:35:03):
And I could go on and on and on and on, and people just don't recognize that. So I want to see if this is still true. I'm just going to open my phone and clock app. And they had the craziest description for alarms. It's a little bit different, but people can look at their own phone. So I have, it says alarms and it says sleep and a vertical bar, wake up and says, no alarm, and a button that says change. And then if you hit it, it says sleep is off. In order to automatically turn on sleep features and edit your schedule, you need to turn sleep on. So obviously sleep was a good name for this thing if you already had a way of getting people to understand it. If you don't, it's ungrammatical and incomprehensible and why would you ever do it? And I got to guess, it's been like this for years, 90 plus percent and maybe 98% of people just do what I do, which is that you just create, "I want the alarm on and I'm going to set the time for it."

(00:36:11):
And I don't know what turning sleep on does, but it's just the lack of comprehension prevents people from getting the value. And I'm sure that there's a bunch of value behind turning sleep on, whatever that means and people spend a lot of time on those features and it integrates with biometrics and your watch or who knows. Again, I still don't know because turning sleep on is like, what does that do? And what is it going to cost me? And what impact it's going to have? Those examples are just to me all over the place. And the reason I don't use most software where there was an actual choice point or the reason I don't use most features where there was a choice point for me is because I didn't understand what they were going to do and I don't give a shit. And if there is one mantra that I would use to replace that it's, Don't Make Me Think, I don't know if you remember that book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):
Absolutely.

Stewart Butterfield (00:37:04):
Yeah. And honestly, it's been many more than 10 years since I read it, so I don't even remember all of the examples in the book, but as a mantra that was up there with utility curves because for two reasons. One is it's just like it's expensive to make a decision. You literally burn glucose. There's a metabolic action. There's ATP created in the mitochondria and your neurons and a bunch of stuff is happening and people do get decision fatigue and there is cognitive cost of all these things. But also there's an emotional aspect, which is, if your software stops me a second and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. I'm like, "I don't understand this."

(00:37:50):
Some people, maybe their orientation is, "Okay, the software is stupid." But I think most people are like, "Oh, I'm dumb." And if you ever talk to people who aren't especially technologically savvy, the canonical example is people who are under 50 talking to their parents about using some piece of software and what they're supposed to do, the parents always feel stupid like they're the ones that are wrong. And so if you're causing people to think, in the best case, it's unnecessary use of their biological resources, and in the worst case you've now made them feel bad, emotionally bad, and they're going to associate that with the product forever. And these are things that are just kind of rolling one into the other.

(00:38:35):
So I'm going to keep going with one last thing, because they just kind of come together, which is along with reduced friction, it's like reduce the number of clicks or taps it takes for someone to accomplish something which is almost always exactly the wrong thing. It's the easiest way you could make any action in your app, a single click or tap by just exposing every single possibility on one screen that scrolls for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages. And obviously that's terrible. So why do people think that a little bit of that is good? And here's an example. You open a menu, there's 14 things that people might want to do.

(00:39:22):
Level one is group them into like items and put a vertical, sorry, horizontal divider between them so at least people can kind of chunk and see what there is. Step two is present the two or three most common things or the five most common things, whatever and then have some form of other and then you go to a sub menu that has more items and the decision of how to tune that becomes incredibly important. I'm going to pick on Google again just because it is, I feel like I'm Donald Trump here, but I'm going to interrupt myself again with a story. It's-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:57):
Yeah, let's do it.

Stewart Butterfield (00:39:58):
At some conference or event, I don't remember what it was, and this is probably eight years ago and we're in the bar after the sessions ended at this thing. John Collison from Stripe is there and Sundar, CEO of Google is there. And John, sorry, Patrick goes up to Sundar and they can talk about anything. Stripe wasn't the behemoth, it was now at that point, but it was still a significant company, was up and coming. And what does Patrick want to talk to the Sundar about? It's in the Gmail app, the dragging of people. When you reply all to a message, you often want to change the two recipient to CC and move someone from CC to two or something like that. And just how physically the degree of dexterity that's required to do that inside of the Gmail app is very high.

(00:40:56):
It still hasn't been fixed, but it really struck me that Patrick could have asked for anything. It could have been any talk, it could have been a partnership. It was so irritating to him that it worked like this, he couldn't quite get over it. So anyway, back to bashing on Google, who in many respects do an incredible job and there's all kinds of amazing stuff they do on blah, blah, blah, but the Gmail actions on an individual email are broken into two very long menu items that are different. And one of them doesn't exist on either menu. There is an unlabeled icon is the only way to do it, and that's to mark something as unread once it's read. I have no idea why some of the actions are in one menu and some of the actions are in another menu. I think it's because some of them have to do with an individual email and some of them have to do with the whole thread, but it doesn't seem very consistent.

(00:41:55):
Every possible thing is listed there in one place. And so it becomes incredibly difficult to use because sometimes you have to tap in both menus, read all of the options, and say, "Okay, I've used the process of elimination and it's not here, so it must be there." Uber doesn't work like this anymore, but when I first brought this up to people inside of Slack, there was a moment when the Uber app, when you opened it was just, "Where would you like to go?" And other. And other was everything like change your payment method, set your location, anything you could do in Uber. And that was perfect because almost all the time people just wanted to choose where they wanted to go. Sometimes you wanted to change where your pickup was because you weren't there yet or whatever. And that was just like, what could be simpler than, "I'm going to tell you where I want to go or I'm going to achieve something else."?

(00:42:47):
I really tried to push people to what is the thing that people, or what is the two things or what is maybe three things that people could want to do here and then put everything behind other. And then if it takes them eight clicks or taps to do something, but every single one is trivially easy, that's great. If you reduce that to two clicks or taps, but every part of it is this fraught decision where I'm opening all of the menus and trying to figure out which thing is the right thing, and the more, comparing three things to each other is this difficult four things, it's kind of geometrically more expensive to compare 15 different options all to the other to see if this is the one that you might want. That just becomes impossibly expensive. So to me, those are all really connected. And if people could get over the idea of reducing friction as the [inaudible 00:43:42] or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software? How can I make this trivially easy? One last example, because this was really influential for me. So I was going back and forth in Vancouver in San Francisco at the time when we were talking about all this inside of Slack, and I was behind a teenager in line aboard the plane and it was like, we're on the jet way. It took a long time. And I was watching her use Snapchat and it was insane.

(00:44:11):
She was tapping at least four times a second, sometimes six or seven times a second. It was like dismissing stories and doing stuff. But there was a fluidity to it because everything was like, do I want to see this again? Do I want to see the next story from this person? Do I want to switch to a different person? Instead, a notification came up, she answered someone's thing, she took a selfie of herself and everything was just like... So she was tapping four times a second for six minutes. I mean, probably there was some breaks in there. And that was the highest and best use of Snapchat for a 15 year old girl in 2016 or whenever that was. And imagine if the goal was to try to make her tap less, how much of an impediment it would've been to the experience that both her and Snapchat wanted to create?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):
It's so fun to listen to this and the examples you gave of, it gives us a lot of insight into the way your mind works of just constantly unsatisfied with the way other products work with your product. And I think that's core. Patrick is a good example of Stripe. I feel like that's a recurring theme with very successful product leaders is just constantly unsatisfied and unhappy with how things work.

Stewart Butterfield (00:45:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:28):
I love just even the way you summarize this, just a really good reframing of, instead of obsessing with reducing friction and reducing steps, instead think, how do I reduce the amount of thinking the user has to do? I've never heard of it described as, you have to think about the ATP and glucose being used to actually think, and your goal is to reduce that versus let's just reduce friction, reduce clicks.

Stewart Butterfield (00:45:52):
Yeah. I think in my more cynical examples, I would say to people, " Stop what you're doing for a second, close-"

Stewart Butterfield (00:46:01):
Stop what you're doing for a second. Close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths, and then pretend that you're an actual human being. And open their eyes again, and then look at this thing and see, can you figure out what it's supposed to do or say. Or what action you're supposed to take or what the impact will be if you take that action. There's a whole nother related cycle. But before I get into it, I know that I am verbose. I want to wrap up your last example of people being unsatisfied.

(00:46:31):
So here's the quote that I was trying to find. This is 2014, so like that was the year that Slack actually launched officially in February. And this is now near the end of the year. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, "Oh God, yeah. I try to instill this into the rest of the team, but certainly I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public. Not everyone finds that motivational though."

(00:47:06):
So I came into the office the next day and people had printed out on like 40 pieces of 8.5 by 11 paper that quote, and pasted it up on the wall. But to me that was like, you should be embarrassed by it. It should be a perpetual desire to improve. You should probably be like, "Oh, this is great," and you could be proud of individual pieces of work. But in the aggregate, if you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product, or you shouldn't be in charge of the company, or you shouldn't almost nothing.

(00:47:45):
Again, you could reduce it down to a tiny feature is anywhere close to perfect. And if A, that's acknowledged freely inside the organization. And B, people think about continually improving as the goal. And that could be like Six Sigma Toyota, Kaizen, that kind of side of thing. Or it could be that story that... I can't remember his name right now. The guy who started Bridgewater tells about Michael Jordan-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):
Ray Dalio.

Stewart Butterfield (00:48:12):
Yeah, Ray Dalio in his book talks about Michael Jordan learning to ski. Every time he messed up, he wanted the ski instructor to tell him exactly what he was doing wrong. Because to him, every one of those was a gem that he could collect, and he could actually become a good skier. And what he wanted to do was become a good skier. That requires a lot of trust inside the organization.

(00:48:36):
But if you can get to the point where like, "Hey, we are trying to find improvements. We're trying to be critical because you're trying to make this as great as it can possibly be." And not always, not with every person, but most of the time with most people, you can get them to the point where that really direct criticism is actually motivational. It is like people are grateful to have the feedback, whether that's coming from their peers inside the company or from end users of the product. Because you realize, oh yeah, that is bad and we should fix it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):

So if you've been sitting on an idea, now is the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at Lovable.dev. That's lovable.dev. This makes me think about, let's call it a rant that you have about how it takes a lot of work to make anything work at all. That just the default state is not working. Can you just share what you share there.

Stewart Butterfield (00:50:13):
Yeah. I mean, so this is a lot to do with, and maybe this is more recently, it shows up in politics a lot for me. But by the way, if anyone listening to this can help me find this tweet store from somewhere between 2016 and 2020, I don't have a precise idea. And it was this guy's thread about how hard it was to get a stop sign set up. And I believe it was in response to someone claiming that Bitcoin is going to replace US dollars, something about crypto. And his point was like, here's what happened when we tried to get a stop sign put up on a residential street in my neighborhood. And the literal years it took, and the number of agencies that were involved.

(00:50:58):
Like the engineering department, traffic planners, the HOA, and... I don't remember all of the organizations because, and I did that I could search better and find this again. Because it was truly a masterpiece of how difficult it is to get a stop sign put up in most places. The message that I hear from most politicians, and unfortunately this works really well, is things should be good. But they're not because someone is doing something bad, which is preventing the goodness.

(00:51:29):
So billionaires are making things unaffordable. Or immigrants are taking your jobs. Or lazy freeloaders are sucking off a government tea, and causing us all have to pay more taxes, or something like that. The reality is almost nothing works. It's actually another call. I said in this case, John has a great encapsulation of this and I'm sure you're familiar with it, like that. It ends with the world as a museum of passion projects. Because for anything to get done at all requires not just the resources and effort required to instantiate that thing in the real world, but all of the politicking and the sociology and the convincing.

(00:52:15):
And there's a book called Why Nothing Works Recently, which is like, it's not an... I'm sorry to the author, if they... I doubt they're listening, but just it's not like an amazingly written book. I found it a little bit repetitive, but the content was really incredible, just explaining why it's so hard. And how there's this progressive increase in the number of vetoes that are available for any kind of course of action and how difficult it is... And this shows up in permitting for new construction and stuff like that. But also shows up obviously inside of organizations.

(00:52:55):
And the challenge is that people, A, I think this is evolutionary biological. It's hard for us to understand the world, except by anthropomorphizing it. And so if it didn't rain this year, it's because a God is mad, and probably because we didn't sacrifice enough goats or something last year. It's hard for people to understand just that, wow, weather is incredibly complex and chaotic, and ecosystems and climatology, and all that.

(00:53:27):
Same thing with the world. Like if I am struggling to pay all of my bills and be able to afford a little bit of luxury in the sense of location or a present for my kids or whatever, it's got to be somebody's fault. There has to be a decision that's made somewhere. And the reality is everything is so complicated. Everything is so multivariate, it's not satisfying. It's a terrible political message.

(00:53:56):
It's much easier to say that there is like, oh, we understand why things are bad in the way that you're concerned about. And it's turns out that it's some someone's decision, and because of them it's bad. And so if we got rid of them or were able to overcome their decision, overturn it, and institute our own thing, then things would be good for you. And this really to me shows up inside of those organizations as well. I'll pause there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):
I know kind of along those lines, you're a big believer in something called Parkinson's Law.

Stewart Butterfield (00:54:31):
Yeah. So the original of that is, I think it's 1956. It's an article in The Economist by Parkinson. And the Maxim is work expands to fill the time available for its completion. And the way that it shows up, this is a little bit subtle. So like one of the things I found, since I don't have a job is there's much less time pressure. And that maxim, like if you want something done, give it to a busy person. The inverse is also true that like, if you're not that busy, wow, basic things take a really long time.

(00:55:09):
And so Parkinson actually starts out with his example of writing and posting a letter. And I don't remember who he used with the first example, but someone who's incredibly busy and has all these things they have to respond to. And then another case like a retired robot who has all the time in the world. It takes her a long time to write the letter. It takes her a long time to put it in the envelope, and then you go to the post office and post it.

(00:55:28):
But the real meat of it is, for me later when he talks about the size of the organization, and he uses a bunch of examples. This is again 1950s, and he's British, so he's looking at the Royal Navy. And specifically he's looking at a chart that shows the relationship between the number of capital ships in the Navy, the number of sailors, and the number of administrators. And very familiar graph for people looking at any part of government. Any part of the relationship between the number of administrators at a university and the number of students and faculty, teaching faculty. Where it's like, okay, the number of ships goes like this and the number of sailors is looking right along with it. And the number of administrators goes like this.

(00:56:14):
And the reason this ties into the work expands to fill the time available for its completion is people hire, and they train. And here's the sad truth for anyone running a company is there are exceptions. There's certain types of engineers that are an exception to this. But the overwhelming majority of people you hire want to hire more people who report to them. And it's not because they're evil, and it's not because they're stupid. In fact, they're smart because everyone knows that the number of people who report to you correlates with your career trajectory, the amount of money that you're paid. The amount of authority you have inside the organization and on and on and on.

(00:56:57):
So we would hire 27 Royal product managers in Slack who immediately want to hire someone. It's like, what the hell? What would that person do? And they articulate it this way, but essentially it's like, "Well, that person would do the product management and then I would do strategy."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):
Classic.

Stewart Butterfield (00:57:12):
It's really, I think the essential thing to understand about this is it's not because people are evil, and it's not because they're stupid. And it's to me, very related to everything is complex. And if maybe this is my butterfly's law, I haven't thought about this way before. But I tweeted this a very, very long time ago like if you... Everything is simple if you have no idea what you're talking about. So the other side of that is like if something seems simple, probably you don't understand it. And there's obvious exceptions to that.

(00:57:53):
But for anything that involves a large organization or a lot of human beings, if the problem seems simple, you don't get it. So every budget process, no head of engineering know, head of sales, no CFO, no GC, who's ever going to come back and say, "Oh, I've actually think next year we can just hire fewer people. Or we're going to keep it flat or we're going to shrink through attrition because we don't need any more people to do what we're doing." Not because they're evil, not because they're stupid, but it's almost overpowering impulse inside the organization that often leads to disastrous results. And so there's an...

(00:58:30):
I'll give one example from Slack's history, and I have tried in the past to disguise this example so that no one feels bad about it but I... Unfortunately, the specifics are so important to the example that it's not disguised and so I'll just reiterate that the people involved aren't stupid or evil. And one example that's from the outside. So the example inside of Slack was we introduced threads, which was the ability to reply to a message inside of a channel. And let's say you, Lenny, post a message. I, Stewart reply to it. You will automatically get a notification. And now Sarah later on replies to the same message. Both you and I, as people who have push in that thread will receive a notification that there's been more activity, and so on. So like every single time anyone replies to it.

(00:59:23):
So when the feature first was released or like when we did the final product review before it was released, the input box was pre-populated with at the person before you in the thread. And I was using the feature and I would put the insertion point there, select all delete, and then start writing my message. And even if I wanted to add someone specifically, I almost never wanted to start my sentence with at that, because it just made it hard to reference what they were saying before. So I said, "Get rid of this because, A, I think most people won't use it. Or if they did want to add someone, they're not going to want to do it at the beginning of the sentence.

(01:00:07):
And by the way, you're teaching them to use the product wrong. Because it's important that everyone understand that every previous poster in this thread will automatically receive a notification unless they've figured it."

(01:00:20):
So okay, we release it. Six months goes by and suddenly the at thing comes back. And so I messaged someone around the team and I said, "Hey, there's been a regression. This is super weird. I don't know what happened. But the at thing came back." And they said, "Oh no, this is on purpose. We did a bunch of research." And so I was like, "What?" And I went through this and it was, if I recall correctly, it wasn't even P-95 certainty on this analysis. But it was something like when we do this, threads are 2.17 messages long, versus 2.14 messages long on average for when we don't do it.

(01:00:59):
And so first of all, why is a longer thread better? Like maybe a shorter thread is better? It can be fewer messages that people have to go back and forth. Also, that's such a tiny difference. Also, again, I don't remember the actual statistical analysis, so I'm not going to claim that it was incorrect. But I'm pretty sure this was outside the bounds of certainty that they can have. But the real thing was, oh my God, so you guys put flags into the product, you A-B tested it. You did the instrumentation. You created tables in the database or whatever we're using to record all of that.

(01:01:39):
You wrote queries to pull that. You created charts based on that data. You had meetings to discuss it. And just kind unpacking all of the things that would've had to happen for this to come back. And it's like thousands of person hours at a minimum, because any feature change at that scale of organization, it's involving like a dozen people. Engineering, QA, analytics teams, project managers, user research and stuff like that. The problem with that, so I think it was a bad idea, right? But the problem with that was the difference that you could possibly achieve between having this feature and not having this feature is like this much whatever units you want. The cost of doing the analysis was this much. So it's guaranteed to be a loser.

(01:02:29):
Like there's just, there's no world in which anyone could imagine putting the at previous respondent in the thread at the beginning of the message could possibly make that much of a difference to the quality of Slack, and how much utility it provides for people and all of that. But you know that to put the feature flags in, to ship new versions of the product, to put the instrumentation in. To have it all the API calls to record every action that people take to do all the analytics, to create the dashboard. To put paste a screenshot of that into a Google Slides presentation. To send the invitations to the meeting, to reschedule the meeting because someone couldn't make it. To have everyone sit down and look at the thing. Like guaranteed loser.

(01:03:14):
And I know that Fareed told you to ask me about this hyper realistic work-like activities. And so here's my grand theory. Hyper realistic work-like activities goes along with this other concept called known valuable work to do. And when I say known, I mean both you know what it is and you know that it's valuable. And the problem with almost every organization at the very beginning, you have an enormous amount of work that you know what to do, and you know that it's going to be valuable. So like starting a business, open a bank account. Because there's almost infinite general value of opening a bank account. You have to do it. It's very simple to do.

(01:04:01):
And so at the very beginning of any startup, they're like, "I'm creating a user's table, and I'm doing sorting passwords," and you're doing all the things that are kind of absolutely necessary. And everyone knows exactly what they are. And so everyone's going to work in the morning and they're like right on. And I have 10 things to do, and every single one of them is something I know how to do. And it's definitely going to be valuable. Time goes on. And the relationship between the supply of work to do and the demand for doing work just starts to change.

(01:04:32):
More and more people get hired. Every product manager wants to hire a junior product manager. Every new person, the first person you bring in on the risk and compliance team is like, "Oh my God, there's so many risks and things we have to be compliant with. We better hire more people on my team to do more risk and compliance work." Which probably to some degree is right. But we're going to have more and more of those people and they're going to call meetings with each other.

(01:04:54):
And now suddenly you have all these people with work to do and you've done all the easy obvious stuff. And now your questions are like, "God, should we do FedRAMP high and make a Slack version? Which is going to require us to have wholly separate physical infrastructure for the hardware that runs the software? And also a whole different operations team, which has only US citizens on it? What is the possible number of dollars that we could make from doing this? And how much complexity is going to be when we want to do updates to the software because we update two totally separate independent systems and rec."

(01:05:27):
It just gets out of whack, and so people end up... Like if you hire 17 product marketers, you're going to have 17 product marketers worth of demand for work to do. And if you don't have sufficient supply of product marketing work to do, they're just going to do other stuff. Again, very important, not because they're stupid, not because they're evil. But because they're like, I'm a product marketer and I want to be recognized for my work. And my spouse has criticized me because they take, I should have already got promoted in the last cycle, and they really got to demonstrate some wins here and whatever it is.

(01:06:02):
And so people are like calling meetings with their colleagues to preview the deck that they're going to show in the big meeting to get feedback on whether they should improve some of the slides. And that hyper-realistic work-like activity is superficially identical to work. Like we are sitting in a conference room and there's something being projected up there, and we're all talking about it. And that's exactly what work is. Hopefully not all of work for everyone inside of your company. But that's exactly what we do when we're working.

(01:06:34):
But this is actually a fake bit of work, and it's so subtle that I'll do it. Our board members will do it. Every executive will do it. And the further you are from having all of the context and all of the information and the decision-making authority and stuff like that, the easier it is to get trapped in this stuff. And people will just perform enormous amounts of hyper-realistic work-like activities, and have no idea that that's what they're doing. And the result of that, I guess, is that if you are a leader, if you're manager, director, an executive, you're the CEO, it's on you to ensure that there is sufficient supply of known valuable work to do. And there almost always is, but it's creating the clarity around that. Creating the alignment. Making sure everyone understands it, but that's what they're supposed to be doing, and then obviously doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):
Amazing. I could listen to Stewart's rants all day. Hyper- realistic work-life activities. We need to coin this-

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:34):
Unfortunately, it doesn't make a good acronym. It's pretty ugly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):
Okay.

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:37):
[inaudible 01:07:37].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:36):
Okay. [inaudible 01:07:37] it a try. And just to close the loop on that, the solution is the leader recognizing this is happening and stopping it. Telling people why are we spending time on this thing that is not going to get us anywhere?

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:48):
Yeah. And what you just said probably isn't the best way because that sounds like you're chiding them, and they're dumb. When it's actually your responsibility to make sure that there's sufficient clarity around what the priorities are, and explicitly saying no to things upfront and stuff like that. Rather than merging and say like, "Hey, you guys are a bunch of idiots wasting your time on this thing that doesn't matter." Whose fault is it? It's the manager's fault. It's the VP of whatever's fault. It's the CX, whatever, it's the C... Ultimately, it's the leader of the organization that has the responsibility to make sure that there is sufficient known-valuable work to do. And that's actually harder than it might appear.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):
Okay. Before we run out of time, I want to touch on two other topics. One is, when people think of Stewart Butterfield, I think a lot of people think of, We Don't Sell Saddles Here. Your legendary Medium post that is just, I don't know, it's become a historic piece of literature in the annals of product building and in startups. I haven't heard people ask you much about this recently. So let me just ask a couple of questions. What was the reason you put that out? What was the backstory on writing that memo? Why was it necessary?

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:01):
Well, it really was an internal memo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):
... Memo. Why was it necessary?

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:01):
Well, it really was an internal memo and there's a bit of a digression. One of the crappy things about Slack is if all your corporate communication is on email, depending on exactly how it works and what system you use, you probably walk away with an archive of everything you said at Company X. If it's Slack, once you're turned off, you lose access to all that history. And so it's kind of like, "Oh, man. If I had only exported all of my messages before I left, I would have all this stuff," but that was absolutely verbatim. I did not change a word of what I said inside the company. Well, I think we were still eight people. Maybe at most 10, but I think it was eight people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:45):
It was before Slack launched even.

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:47):
Yeah, it was before Slack launched. It was when we're doing private beta. And the point of it was to start to instill those ideas as early as possible and really create this alignment inside of that small team so that it could persist to survive as we grew and scaled. Yeah, that was the idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):
And the gist, just for people that aren't super familiar with it, but we'll link to it, is just it's not enough just to build a great product. You just as much have to put effort into communicating what this does for them, the problem this is solving for them, the outcome this is going to achieve for them. Is that a good way to think about it?

Stewart Butterfield (01:10:28):
Yeah. And again, comparing it to beer or cars, beer goes back to pre-civilization. Cars were obviously [inaudible 01:10:38], but at some point you had to convince people why they would want a car instead of a horse. For your new AI-based recruiting tool or your calendar app or whatever, there's some reason why you think that people should use yours instead of the thing that they're using now, which might be a wholesale one-for- one replacement, or more often is a change in the way that you're working that has a bunch of other adjacencies and you want to expand into these other categories. You're not just responsible for creating the product, but also, to a certain degree, creating the market.

(01:11:15):
There's this book, Positioning, which is an absolute classic. It's very short. I would recommend everyone read it, where the point of it is, from my perspective, it's almost impossible to create a new idea in someone's head. It's much easier to take a couple of existing ideas and put them together. So it's much easier to say it's like Jaws meets Star Wars, or it's Uber for Pets or something like that, than to come up with an actual new idea. But you have to do that because if your thing is different in any significant way from the alternatives, you're not just creating the product. You're creating the market. They're really kind of one and the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:56):
The reason I wanted to touch on it is I think still people continue to not listen to this advice and continue to over-invest in more features, more products, things like that. Just the specific example of, "We don't sell saddles here," just to quickly communicate this to folks, and correct me if I'm missing anything, is just instead of, "Hey, look at this amazing saddle we've bought," which you want to communicate as, "Here, go horseback riding. Look at this incredible experience you can have." And then they decide, "Oh, shit. I need to go buy a saddle to do that."

Stewart Butterfield (01:12:23):
Yeah. And 100%, that aspect of it is not original because I think that's something that marketers have done for a long time, certainly in the marcom and advertising. If you want to sell Harley-Davidson's, there are people who are going to geek out on the engines and stuff like that and the quality of the leather and stuff like that. But when you're selling the motorcycle, you're selling the open road and freedom and the wind in your hair. And if you're Lululemon, you are obviously selling yoga pants, but you're also selling health and aspiration and being the best version of yourself and a bunch of other stuff. Oh my God, I forgot the classic version of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:00):
There's the ship ...

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:00):
You're selling the screwdriver.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:04):
Oh, yeah. The nail.

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:05):
Yeah, the nail. Anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:07):
Yeah, we missed that one. Well, there's the one I think about is instead of trying to convince men to build a ship, instill a yearning for the sea.

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:16):
Yes. Exactly. That's something that goes back in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):
Okay. Let me ask you about pivoting. You are potentially the king of pivots. You started two companies both famously pivoted, both from video games, which is why I asked you about that at the beginning, into very successful companies. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting. Let me just ask when folks come to you asking, "Should I stick with my idea? Should I pivot?" what sort of advice do you find most helps them?

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:43):
Yeah, I mean, I think it's partly an intuition because obviously the decision is about, "Have you exhausted the possibilities?" and in the case where we were working on Glitch, this game where we used IRC for internal communication and we added a bunch of IRC which became the Proto Slack. I think Slack had an enormous advantage in the fact that we are working on this for several years without actually explicitly working on it and only doing the minimum number of features that were absolutely guaranteed to be successful in the sense that it was so irritating that we couldn't stand it anymore or such an obvious improvement that we couldn't help but take advantage of it. We still had $ 9 million left and everyone still liked the game and we were all happy working on it, but I think by that point I had exhausted every non-verdiculous long shot idea to make it commercially successful, and so I decided to abandon it.

(01:14:52):
But the default advice for anyone in anything is persevere. It's like a kitten hanging off the branch and a poster says, "Hang in there." There's so many stories of, "So-and-so started out going door-to-door and was rejected by everyone and then suddenly there was Nike," or something like that and just, "If you stick with it long enough, you'll eventually be successful." I think you have to really be coldly rational. Some of this shows up in the book Thinking in Bets. Some of it's in Annie Duke's second book, the title of which I'm forgetting right now, but someone will know it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):
Yeah, Thinking in Bets, and then what was the second? I forget.

Stewart Butterfield (01:15:39):
She actually uses Glitch and Slack as an example of a smart fold basically. My expected value here has diminished to the point where this alternative looks more attractive. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating. I convinced so many and you have to convince so many people to get a company off the ground. You have to go to investors. You have to go to early employees and say, "You should leave your other job and come work for this because here's the incredible feature we're imagining." You have to go to the press and you have to make all these promises and you have users and you've committed things to the users and you've convinced them to give up their time for this thing. And so I think for a lot of people, it feels better to just keep doing it until it dies of suffocation due to lack of capital or something like that. Then just to admit, "Okay, I was wrong. This didn't work," and it's humiliating. It's painful. It's wrenching. It has a bad impact.

(01:16:46):
When we shut down Glitch, there was a lot of people who loved it and would spend all of their free time and couldn't wait to get home from work to go play it more. And that was their community and the community just disappeared, all these people and all these identities that have been created. And obviously, people lost their jobs and people who had moved their families to a different city in order to take this job now weren't going to have a job anymore. So pivots aren't something I take lightly. I think it's very different to be like, "There's three of us and we started making this app and then we pivoted to a different app." That doesn't even really count. If you're six months into something, you're still messing around. You're trying to figure out what it is that you're building. It's not really a pivot. Obviously in this case, it worked out great and there's survivorship bias and that doesn't mean that everyone should pivot all the time. But I think creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual, rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):
I love, also, your piece of advice of just exhaust. Once you've exhausted all the ideas, that's a really good time to see what else is out there.

Stewart Butterfield (01:17:56):
Yeah, just all the good ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
All the good ideas,

Stewart Butterfield (01:18:00):
All the realistic. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Yeah. The point you made about just kind of persevering, I just had Melanie Perkins, CEO of Canva, in the podcast. 100 investors rejected her before somebody finally decided to invest and she just kept pushing.

Stewart Butterfield (01:18:19):
Yeah. I think that's a slightly different example, right? She eventually believed in the concept of the product and in the vision. It was just trying to figure out the right articulation to get investors who ended up being obviously very, very happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):
Extremely happy. Oh, geez. Okay. Maybe a final topic depending on how time goes. I want to talk about generosity. I talked to a bunch of people, as I said, that have worked with you and the number one theme that came up again and again and again when I asked them about you and what has stuck most with them is just generosity. So I'm going to read a few examples that I heard from folks that are examples of your generosity over the years.

(01:18:57):
So one person shared that he needed a little money before Christmas and he said, "Stewart literally walked me out of the building, went to the cash machine, handed me $500, told me to go home to my family." Other folks shared that, when you talked about Glitch just recently when you had to lay people off, you cried real tears when you were laying people off and then you spent an incredible amount of time helping them find new jobs and extending their severance pay and just taking it extremely, extremely seriously, much more than I think most people feel like CEOs do. Someone else shared that you paid 100% of employees health insurance to give them just fewer things to think about.

(01:19:35):
When you went public, you basically created the best possible situation for employees, no lockup, direct listing. Also, with the structure of the Slack deal, people said that acquisition was very employee friendly. That's employees. There's also just the way you thought about customers. A few examples: You gave free credits to businesses who were struggling to pay the bills during COVID. You released this fair billing, which I think was very innovative at the time, where you stopped charging people for seats they weren't using, even though they signed a deal to charge for those seats. A lot of times, you slipped release schedules because you just wanted to make features better and better for people. And I'll end with this quote: "Stewart is a leader who takes the responsibility he feels for his employees personally, and to which he extends the most generous circumstances he could muster. That feels worth celebrating."

(01:20:25):
So first of all, I just want to celebrate you. I think it's really rare and inspiring to meet a leader like that. Clearly, you've had a lot of impact on a lot of people. I don't know exactly the question I want to ask, but I guess in what part is this intentional, just like, "This is how we win. I'm going to be very generous and help people because I know this will help long-term"? How much of this is just a [inaudible 01:20:48] and it's just the way you are as a person?

Stewart Butterfield (01:20:49):
I think a lot of it is just the way I am as a person and I had wonderful parents who raised me right, but I think there is a little bit of a lesson there and I'm just going to assume people's familiarity with the prisoner's dilemma. The acts of generosity to me are, "Oh, I am demonstrating that I am going to cooperate as we iterate in this game." And if you do that, then people will also cooperate and you both benefit. Whereas if you never really know if the other person is going to defect at the first opportunity, then your best bet is to defect. And so there's a game theoretic aspect, usually in games that are much, much, much more complicated than the prisoner's dilemma.

(01:21:36):
I think one thing I didn't touch on before, but to me was important enough, is that at more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. It was, "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers." And I wanted to be super clear and explicit about that because it should be if anything you're doing feels like a little bit shady, a little bit cheating, a little bit maximizing at the wrong moment or taking advantage of a customer or anything like that, definitely shouldn't do it. Because to me, I mean I think it's literally true, but it's also an ethical way to run a business. And it's not just that the ethics are good. It's like there's advantages for you. You're able to attract a better class of employees. If all your employees are ethical, then it's going to be a better place for everyone to work and you're going to be happier and you're going to have fewer internal problems and all that stuff.

(01:22:48):
But I think it really is true that especially in the long run, you can't destroy value for your customers and expect to be successful. You have to actually make their lives better. And you could put effort into pointing it out to them and demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it. And I think that is incredibly important and that implies a real generosity, whether that's in negotiating terms with an enterprise deal or that's policy decisions. One time that it blew up in our face was our SLA was like, "For any downtime, you get 100 times your money back." Because from my perspective, it's like if we're down for two minutes, it's like pennies. It doesn't really make any difference. If we're down for 10 hours or something like that, then we have bigger problems than paying back people.

(01:23:51):
Fast-forward, we now have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and we've gone public. And shortly after we go public, we have one of the biggest outages we ever had. I don't remember how long it was, but it was many hours. But by the time we got that scale, 100 times the money back for the third of a day that we were down was $8 million or something like that. It didn't cost us any money because we just gave it to people in the form of credits, but it meant that a bunch of revenue that we had already anticipated for the next quarter wasn't going to show up because people's credits were going to offset what they would've otherwise paid us. And so we definitely changed the terms of service after that because being a public company is a little bit different. But in every other respect, I think they were all really important decisions that were helpful in us becoming successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):
Was that policy ... It was automatic? You didn't even have to claim it. It was just automatically you get this credit?

Stewart Butterfield (01:24:52):
And the default is you don't have to pay if you let us know. This was, "We will automatically, proactively, preemptively without any input from you ..."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:00):
Too generous.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:01):
"Apply this credit to your account, and just send you a message that it happened. And by the way, we will do it on the aggregate for downtime, even if the issue didn't affect you as a customer."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:13):
Wow. Too generous. You found the edge of where you want to be.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:18):
What was that mantra again that you had the company chant? I think this is a really nice way to end it.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:22):
It was, "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value we create for customers."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:28):
Incredible. I'm just trying to picture the entire team at Slack reciting this mantra.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:33):
It was hundreds of people. It felt very like, Kim Jong-Un or Stalin or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:38):
Well, on that note, most people don't know this about you, but your actual name when you were born was not Stewart. It was Dharma.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:46):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
And this all makes sense as you learn that.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:49):
Yeah. My name is Dharma Jeremy Butterfield, so my parents named me. And when I was 12, I changed it because I just really wanted to be normal and for some reason I thought Stewart was a normal name. And by the way, you'll notice this now that I said it. Any character except for Stuart Little the mouse, anytime you see a character in a movie, a novel, TV show or whatever, there's only the loser Stewart and the asshole Stewart. It's obviously, in the collective consciousness, a terrible name and I shouldn't have chosen it and I regret it. But by the time I realized that, Dharma and Greg had already come out and it would've seemed like I was bandwagon jumping. And people thought it was a girl's name, even though in India it's obviously only a boy's name.

(01:26:32):
I'm going to add just one last little tidbit because I forgot about this earlier on and I think it helps tie things together, and it's called the owner's delusion. And this is based on something I posted on Twitter. The person who came up with the name later deleted their account and so I have no idea who it was and who to credit for this. But what I had posted was, and this was a long time ago when restaurant websites have gotten better and it doesn't really matter because Google Local was taking over everything, but this is, let's say, 10 years ago.

(01:27:00):
There's five things you could possibly want when you go to a restaurant's website and it's their street address, their phone number, the menu, the hours of operation ... Oh my God, I'm forgetting the fifth thing. Oh, and making a reservation, how to make a reservation. And again, this problem has to some extent taken care of it's itself or at least improved, but what you would get was this super slow loading photo, the Ken Burns effect as it [inaudible 01:27:30] ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):
The flashed.

Stewart Butterfield (01:27:30):
And then fading in and then some music starts playing. And then if they show you the phone number, it's not clickable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:38):
Image.

Stewart Butterfield (01:27:39):
It's not even text that you can copy because yes, it's an image. And they don't have the hours. They don't put the address or whatever and it's just like, "What?" For sure, whoever made this website for the restaurant owner and the restaurant owner themselves have definitely been in the position where they went to somebody else's restaurant website because they wanted to get the address or the opening hours or the phone number or whatever. So why does it end up like this and what should we call this?

(01:28:01):
And whoever replied to the tweet, she said, "We should call it the owner's delusion," and I was like, "Oh my God. That's perfect." And I think that is incredibly powerful and what ends up with the result, like Apple naming whatever that feature is called Sleep, which it's too hard to understand what that can possibly mean. And that's why people anticipate, despite the fact that when they get to your website for the first time, their intent is absolutely the minimum number of micro points above the threshold required from them to actually take that action.

(01:28:41):
You're like, "All right. Welcome to my website," and there's a bunch of BS and there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense and the buttons are inscrutable. And it's unclear what to do next because I think that my thing is so important and I don't recognize that you are at work and you were late this morning and you have to go to the bathroom and you're just a regular human being who has stuff going on, that you're concerned that your kid is a fuck-up and they're getting in trouble at school and stuff like that. They're not subjects who paid money to go to your play and are sitting in the audience and waiting for that curtain to go out. They're people who are going to bounce in a fraction of a second. And so everyone should always be conscious of the owner's solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:27):
I love that. What's the solution? Is it have other people look at it and give you feedback?

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:31):
Yeah, and recognize it. And unfortunately, it's one of those things like Murphy's Law.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:35):
Yeah.

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:37):
Even you can go wrong even when you take into account Murphy's Law.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:39):
That's right.

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:41):
But if you don't name it and recognize it and discuss it and train yourself to think that way, take a breath, pretend you're a regular person, and then look at this again and see if it makes sense, then you're screwed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:55):
I love that. I love that you threw this in here. I have a billion other questions I'm going to ask you in part two when we do this someday. Stewart, thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for being here.

Stewart Butterfield (01:30:04):

# Lessons in product leadership and AI strategy from Glean, Google, Amazon, and Slack | Tamar Yehoshua

## Transcript

Tamar Yehoshua (00:00:00):
Make sure you go somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. Because if you have great ideas of what to build but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned. You don't want any of this ... Like people in the organization, they ask mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other. That doesn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Today, my guest is Tamar Yehoshua. Tamar is currently president of product and technology at Glean, one of the most successful enterprise AI companies out there right now. Prior to joining Glean, Tamar was chief product officer at Slack for four years where she led product design and research as the company scaled 10Xed their revenue, went through IPO and then got bought by Salesforce. Tamar also led product and engineering teams at Google, where for many years she was responsible for the Google search experience. She also spent five years at Amazon as director of engineering and vice president at A9.com. She was also a venture partner at IVP and has been on board of directors for ServiceNow, Snyk, RetailMeNot, and Yext. In our conversation, we get into all kinds of juicy advice, including why companies don't have to be run well to win, why you don't need a career plan, the two habits she credits most for helping her succeed throughout her career, what she learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield and Marc Benioff, how to build stronger cross-functional relationships and a bunch of advice on AI including how it will likely change your jobs, examples of how she and her colleagues are already using AI to be more productive in their work and what she's learned about building AI-based products that are non-deterministic and can be very unpredictable.

(00:01:51):
This episode is for anyone looking to level up as a leader and get a better sense of how AI will change your job.

(00:02:12):
Tamar, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:02:15):
Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:17):
I've had so many people recommend you coming on this podcast. I'm really happy that we're finally doing this. I want to start with a question that I've started to ask people who have had extraordinarily successful careers, which you've had. So let me ask you, what are one or two specific skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success during the course of your career that you think might be helpful to people who are trying to figure out how to accelerate their career or just be more successful in their career?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:02:47):
One of the things that I think is overlooked is do a really good job at whatever your job is at that point. People have a tendency ... Especially product managers are very ambitious and they want to get to the next level and they're always eyeing the next job, but you're not going to get the next job unless you do really well at the job that you're in. Knock it out of the park. However simple, however easy it may be to you, do a great job. And in tech jobs, there's table stakes. There's table stakes of you need to be technical, you need to know the latest technology, you need to understand your product, the product you're working on. No matter what your role is. You have to understand it deeply. You need to understand metrics. So especially product managers have a wide breadth of things that they need to understand. So those are a given. You need to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:40):
This episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports and analytics within your product?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:05:55):
So now the question is the difference in leadership and executive roles and when you're getting there. So how do you start transitioning? So after you've done a great job at everything and you understand the core skills that you need, another thing you really need to know is understanding people and motivations. And when you're building products, you have to understand why does somebody want to use your product? What problem are they solving? Why do they want to click on that button? What's going to make them feel good when they click on it? What's going to give them delight and what's also going to make them feel bad and frustrated and what do they not want to do? So you need to understand motivations in people for building products and for building teams and organizations. So just like why does somebody want to click on a button, why does somebody want to join your team? Why do they want to work hard? What are they trying to accomplish? What's the goal for their career?

(00:06:54):
So you have to be able to read people, ask lots of questions to understand them. And I'll say one thing that really helped me, this is a strange segue, but my father was a psychiatrist and when I was growing up, we would have family occasions, go to events, whatever, and afterwards in the car ride back, he would always give his perspective of analyzing what happened at the event. What this person was thinking. Why did they say this? And then he would quiz me of, "Why do you think they did that?" And it was really interesting because it taught me to see the whole room. To see how people react. Like Lenny, if you say something and somebody else is there, look at the other person. What's their face saying? You can understand so much if you're paying attention. So I think when you want to build for people and lead organizations, it is about the people and understanding them and motivating them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):
I love this advice. I feel like we could do a whole podcast on just this topic. So on this last point about understanding people, is there an example of this in either a product you built of just like, "Oh, here's something I noticed about someone using Slack or Google or Amazon that changed the way I think about building this specific feature."?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:08:17):
One of the things that I caution product managers about is that you don't want to be too overly reliant on metrics and you want to also have an intuition. You want product managers who understand intuitively their customers and their product and sometimes you'll make decisions because you just know it's the right thing to do because it feels right and it usually is right if you understand your product well enough. How do you get good at it? Ask a lot of questions. Don't assume you know. Marc Benioff would always say, "Have a beginner's mind. Go in assuming that you know nothing and listen to your customers, listen to the people." Because I also see this as you're building a feature and you think it's the best thing. Because of course everyone's going to want it because you worked on it and you're going to put it front and center in the interface where everybody's going to see it. Well, no, you got to earn that right. And that is another thing that people do is they want the thing they worked on to be right there, but it might not be the most important thing that a person needs at that point. So have perspective. Have perspective of what your users are actually trying to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):
Going back to your first point about doing a great job at the job you have, I imagine some people hear this and the advice is do a great job at the job you're already doing, and they may feel like they are, and there's other reasons they aren't being promoted. Is there an example from your career or a story you could tell of just like to clarify what doing a great job look like where it's not just like I hit my goals. It's like, here's what it looks like. Here's how you actually get ahead.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:10:00):
Are you helping the business move forward? So it's not about I achieve what I was asked to do, but did you build something that people actually used? It's not about just launching something and did you do the right thing for the company? And that is different. It's a different mindset. Did you enable the entire organization to be more productive despite you? I remember very early in my career I was working as an engineer and I was offered a job to manage a team that was across different programs. I took a vacation, I came back and I said, "I don't think this team should exist." It was my first management job and I wanted to be a manager. And I said, "Here's why I don't think that this team should exist. It's not the right thing for the company. It's not going to be productive." And my manager was so stunned. He was like, "Wait. You're saying no?" I'm like, "Yeah, because here's how you should organize it." And then he's like, "You're right, and I'll find you something else," and he did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
If I were to put this into one word, it's impact. Drive impact.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:11:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
Amazing. Okay. Going in a different direction, we were chatting before we started recording this and something that you shared with me, and some people may be really surprised to hear this, but I completely agree with this take, is that you don't need to be a well-run business to win. I've seen this myself. I'd love to hear your insights here and especially where you notice this. What parts of your career noticed this to be true?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:11:45):
I love working at well-run companies. It's more fun, your people are happier. I like running a well-run team, so I aspire to have a very well run team and to work at a well run company. But what I've seen is when a company isn't well run like IT isn't working, marketing is broken, there are not enough people in HR, there's a lot of turnover. All of these things I've seen that they're not correlated to the company being successful. So I can think of a couple examples right now of companies I know ... Not Glean, where I'm working today. Where there's high executive turnover. Where people get yelled at. There are lots of people fired. There's reorgs all the time. People I talk to are super unhappy, but the numbers are amazing. They're growing like crazy. And the opposite sit is also true. I can think of one company I know really well, amazing, CEO, well run, well oiled machine, everything. Hired good executives and they flat lined.

(00:12:51):
So you just see it. You see it over and over again and people get very upset about these things that aren't working. And one of the things that I try and do is give a perspective of what matters and what doesn't. And it might even be to the sales team because you get all these requests for features all the time. If you did every single one, it would be impossible. Even if you did, 80, 90% of them won't matter for the success of the company. But then there are some that really matter. So what are the things that really matter? We always talk about product market fit. Nobody really knows what product market fit is. Everybody has a different explanation, but it means people want to use your product. That they're clamoring for it. So you've built something that people value and that people value and that solves a problem for them, but that's also not good enough. You need to build a great product, but you also have to have distribution and you need to have a sales team that works. And you have to have enough money in the bank to get there. So those are probably the things that are the most important. I might be missing something.

(00:13:58):
And then within each of those, there's the things that really mattered and there's so many features that we built at Slack that were the most important features ever that failed and nobody used so it clearly didn't have an impact. And you can see that in retrospect, but I think after being at multiple different big companies and small companies, I have that perspective of let's just make sure that we do the right things and don't get too worked up about all the things that are broken because every startup has so many things that are broken.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:29):
So I think a really interesting insight here is that if you're working at a company that is just chaotic and it feels like we don't know what we're doing, I don't know how this thing is running, I don't know how this will continue to be successful, your experience is it ... Is it that most of the successful companies you've been at are just chaotic internally and aren't incredibly run and that's normal, that's very typical?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:14:51):
Until they get to a certain scale. Now, once you reach a certain scale and you've already conquered the market, then you need to be well run. Then you bring in professional managers and things are about the cost and executing and getting all the ... Once you get to over 5,000 people or 10,000 people, you got to have things that ... Then you're a growth engine. You have to know what phase you're in and what's important at that phase. So it isn't that at every phase, chaos is okay, and also some chaos is okay and some chaos is not okay. If you're changing your strategy all the time and you're changing your direction and you're changing projects on people all the time so that they can't actually achieve anything ... So this is again, so you can't simplify it that some chaos is okay and some isn't. And also some chaos is right for you as a person. There are some really great companies I would never work at because they don't fit me. They're not a company I would enjoy going to work in the morning or they're not aligned with what I'm good at. So just because a company is doing well, if the chaos is chaos and something that's going to make you upset and unhappy don't work there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):
Is there a correlation there? Just like companies that have strong product market fit, things are just breaking as they're going through hyper growth? Just thoughts on why this is the case.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:16:21):
A lot of it is that because if you are in hyper growth, you've got customers coming at a really fast pace, you're growing your company really quickly and the number of employees and it's just really hard to keep up. Because things in the infrastructure break, things in the communication breakdown. You've got at any given point 50% of the company has been there less than six months. But you have to grow really fast because once you hit product market fit, if you don't, then your growth will stop. So if you're suddenly growing, especially if you're an enterprise company, you have to have salespeople, if you're a consumer company or systems have to keep running as you scale. And look at companies like MySpace, well, they died because their product got too slow. And so some companies have initial product market fit and then they don't keep up. So I do think a lot of it is it's very hard to grow that fast. And so things really do start breaking, but then once you get all the right leadership in place, processes in place, then it starts to get better. So it goes through ups and downs in level of chaos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:28):
There's one takeaway here that product market fit solves a lot of problems. Strong product market fit.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:17:33):
Well, no product market fit is a death sentence. I would say it more like that. If you built a product that people aren't really excited to use, then you don't have a company because it's very hard to do that unless you have distribution machine and then you catch up over time. But we will not name companies like that. So there are other ways of doing it, but yeah, that is the most important thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:00):
Yeah. I will say during my experience at Airbnb, I absolutely saw this. It was just nonstop chaos. And I always felt like, well, how is this continuing to operate and succeed? Things are just out of control. Everything's changing every six months. I don't know what's happening here. And I think a lesson here is just that's normal for a hyper growth business that has strong product market fit. But again, not a good excuse to just allow chaos. And it's not like chaos means success, right?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:18:30):
And it's not a good excuse to not have an organization that's functioning. You should still strive to have an organization that's functioning and keep people happy and motivated and all that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):
Great. Okay. Another maybe contrarian opinion that you hold along the career track is that you don't need to plan your career. I also 100% agree with this. I had no plan for my career. I never knew where the hell I was going to go. I never had this vision of here's what I want to do. I just followed things that were pulling me and things that seemed interesting. I love that you also tell people this. I'd love to hear your insights here. Especially for someone that's either struggling with their career or just stressed. They don't have a plan or their plan's not working the way they wanted it to.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:19:12):
Really recently I was talking to somebody in their twenties who was asking me for career advice. Should I be a product manager, et cetera. And I'm trying to put together my five-year plan and I said, "I never had a five-year plan." So to be clear, some people need that. That's the kind of people they are. They want the planning. I said, "It's great if you want that, but I never had it." And the person I was talking to just relaxed and they're like, "Oh my God, that's so great to hear because I have no idea what I want to do in five years." I'm like, "I still have no idea what I want to do in five years. I've never had an idea what I want to do in five years." Early in your career you have a lot more angst about it because the forks in the road are more significant because they can go, do I go get an MBA or do I go work for somebody? Do I be a product manager or an engineer? And those really take you in very different paths.

(00:20:09):
And I meet a lot of kids in their ... I shouldn't call them kids. My kids are my kids' friends. But a lot of people who are younger in their career who are struggling with this a little bit. So what I believe, and I've always believed is that you follow people. You learn the most from people. I don't look for domains. Some people have a domain, like I'm super interested in climate or whatever and they really want to work in that area and that's fine so maybe within that area. But you follow people who are the best at what they do. So it's not good enough to follow somebody who you like. You want to follow somebody who's either the best product thinker or the best engineer or the best salesperson. And so that you will learn the skill of how to be the best at that.

(00:21:01):
So you follow people where you're going to learn the most. And a way to do that also is you look at where the great people are going. So you want to go to companies where there's also a nexus of great people because they together will do great things. And even if the company fails or succeeds, but not as much as you'd like, you still have those connections. Everybody talks about the PayPal Mafia and how they've gone on to do things. I was super lucky to be at Google for so many years and I spent a lot of time with Googlers that I met and that are all working in different companies now because you build those relationships by working together. So if you follow people and where you're going to learn the most and you go step by step, I think that's a great way of progressing in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:53):
That's such tactical advice. And I've seen this work for a lot of people that just go where their favorite former employees work. And not favorite to your point, but the people that they most respect and have been most impressed by. And I think it's such an easy thing to do. It's a really easy heuristic for understanding where to go. There's something Marc Andreessen once shared that I'm reminded of when you say this. There's a term for this, I forget the actual term, but there's certain companies have this gravitational pull where they are acquiring all the best talent. They're currently the gravity in the space and everyone awesome is going there. And you have to, as a company, know you're one of those companies or you're the opposite. You're losing all the people and they're all going to this other company. I guess any thoughts on that?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:22:43):
Yeah. And it's really bad when you don't have a gravitational pull. It's super hard. I would say that one thing that if you're a manager, I always advise managers, go somewhere where you can recruit. I got a piece of advice from a friend that I thought was amazing advice as a leader. She said to me, "Take a job where if you hire people, it's going to make their careers." I was like, "Whoa." Because I was getting offers for some turnaround jobs. And if you think you can turn around, great. But if you're going to hire the best people, you want to make sure that it's going to be a good place for them and that they're going to learn and they're going to grow. And so you want to do right by them. And you really earnestly want to say you can make your career by coming here.

(00:23:36):
And I thought that gave such a higher bar for every job I was looking at as a leader that I thought it was just amazing advice. And then on the flip side, on the negative side, some people are putting too much emphasis on where will I get a big financial return? And I've found that financial returns are the hardest to predict. You know who's good. You know who you want to work with. You can predict where you're going to learn. Because even if a company fails, you learn a lot. But predicting financial success is so hard because you don't know what's going to happen with the market, with the world, with crypto, and Meta AI. And people who do that and say ... I had one person say, "I took this job because I'm a mercenary. They just paid me a ton." Did not work out for him. And I feel really bad when people do that, but I think that it's a dangerous thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
I imagine some people hearing this advice are going to feel like, "I'm not going to get a job at OpenAI or Glean or other awesome companies that everyone wants to go work at." Any advice to those folks?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:24:52):
There's lots of good companies and there's lots of smart people. You don't have to be at the top brand. And if you go somewhere where you're going to learn and it's going to get you there. I made mistakes. I went to some companies, multiple companies that failed or stopped growing and didn't do well or didn't have all the right people. Careers you don't make every step is to the right place. You remember in what you cited, all the companies I went to that did well, you left out all the ones that I went to that didn't do well. And so then people will assume that every time I made a job change, it was to a company that did well. No. That was not the case. So if you focus on that learning bit, you will get there. And there are lots of paths. There isn't just the OpenAI or Glean or Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):
Awesome. And again, I love how tactical this is. If someone is trying to figure out where to go work if they're unhappy in their current job or don't have a job right now is just make a list of the people you most respect that are the best at the thing they do, see where they work and there's your list of companies to potentially go after. There's a lot of benefits to this as you shared. It's not just helping you pick the place to work, it's the network. It'll level you up. Is there anything else along those lines that is helpful for people to think about why this is a really good strategy?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:26:10):
Skills can't be taken away. A company can fail, but if you learn a skill, you will always have that skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):
I love that. And I've totally seen this to work, so I really love that you're focusing on this advice. You've mentioned places you've worked and folks you've worked with. You worked with folks like Jeff Bezos, Stewart Butterfield, some of the top product thinkers, leaders in the world. So let me just ask, what's one thing you learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:26:37):
Probably can't narrow it down to one, but I'll talk about Bezos first. I was very lucky to join Amazon early when I still ... I had quarterly meetings with Jeff Bezos. And this was before AWS launched, so it was before Amazon was known in the Valley. This is another example. I went there because I went to work for Udi Manbe who started A9 and he was talking to me one night trying to recruit me and he spent two hours on the phone with me telling me how amazing Jeff Bezos was. And this was before there were any books on him. And that really convinced me to go there. So there's a lot written on Bezos. Read his shareholder letters, read the books about him, read Colin Bryar's Working Backwards. The Everything Box I think it's called or The Everything Store.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):
The Everything Store. Yeah.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:27:27):
There's so many good books and there's so much to learn about how he works. So I won't try and cover those things. The things that stood out to me from the meetings I had with him were a couple of things. One, a lot of people have written about these six pagers, so he doesn't believe in PowerPoint. You write a six pager about ... It's like studying for the final exam is writing these six pagers. So you go into the meeting and there's the people around the table, his executive team and him. First he does not speak until everybody around the table speaks. So he goes around to all his leads and said, "What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?" And I'm sitting there like, "I don't care what anyone think. I just want to hear what Bezos thinks." But he wants to make sure that it's a team effort and that he's listening to what everybody in his organization thinks.

(00:28:17):
And he always spoke last. He is by far the smartest person I've ever met in my life. I've worked with a lot of smart people. But his ability to go deep in any domain and nail the core issue, and remember. We would've quarterly meetings and from quarter to quarter he would remember things that he had talked about before and then he would go into the architecture of search and why are you doing it this way or that way? And you're just blown away that he knows that. For me, the biggest takeaway from those meetings was his consistency, which is he had principles that it made it easier for you to operate in his company because you knew what he cared about because he always had these principles. Everything had to be customer driven, everything had to be relevant for the customer.

(00:29:12):
He hated icons. That was just the thing. You had to write what they were because people couldn't figure out what they are. So anytime you showed an icon, he would get annoyed. But you would go in and after a couple of meetings you're like, "Okay. I know what he's going to ask about. I know how he's thinking and I know what his principles are." And I think that consistency enables you to operate a large organization more effectively. And then there's one other thing that I really remember was one of the few really small meetings I was in with him and we were presenting working on a new product, and I was like, "Our competitors have 10 times as many people as we do on this." And he looks at me and he said, "That is your advantage." And then he goes into his talk about how it's a hill and it takes seven years to build a product. You can't look at it in the near term. You have to be in it for the long term. You can be sure I never went in and said, "I need a lot more resources." So that was Bezos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):
Awesome.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:30:17):
Stewart. Again, I went to Slack because I wanted to work with Stewart Butterfield. I think he is the best product thinker in the Valley. He's not working in product right now. He's taking time off. But he's got this combination of long-term thinking and in the details. So in 2014, he wrote a master plan for Slack, which was build a product people love, build a network. That's Slack Connect. Build a platform that makes all of your other SaaS products more valuable. That's Slack Platform. And then do some magic AI stuff. Magic AI stuff took a lot longer, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):
That was part of his plan early on is magic AI stuff.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:30:55):
It literally was. There was a grid with four boxes in 2014 and it never changed. That was his master plan and what we worked on each year changed. But somebody recently asked me, "You guys did Slack Connect much later?" I'm like, "Yeah, but it was always part of the plan." It was always part of his vision. So he saw forward in the vision, but he also was very much into the details. And I think the thing that I learned from him the most was the power of prototyping. And that even though he was such a great product thinker, he would always say, "I can't tell you if this is going to work. I have to feel it. I have to try it. And a mock-up doesn't tell you what it's going to feel like." And he would push people to do prototypes, not incremental of just to get a feature out, but really to think. Very soon after I started, we launched ... I hired a design lead, Ethan Eismannn, and he led a redesign of the new information architecture for Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:59):
I worked with Ethan at Airbnb.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:32:00):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):
He was head of design for the search experience and the search team.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:32:04):
Yeah. Ethan is awesome. And he came in and his first task was to work with Stewart on this redesign. And Stewart came in and said, "I want you to take everything in the interface and put it behind one button." And everyone's like, "That's never going to work." And he's like, "Do it. Just do it." And so we had our prototypers ... We had also engineers, front-end engineers who were really good at prototyping, literally took everything in the interface and put it behind one button and he said, "This is how you're going to see what you really need in the interface." So we were never going to ship that, but it was the beginning of the redesign.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:43):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career and your life. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. Having a group of trusted and amazing peers was key to my career growth. And this is the Sidebar ethos, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers on your own. Sidebar is a platform for senior tech professionals, director to C-level to advance in their career. Members are matched into peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, all running on Sidebar's technology Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your career journey.

(00:33:35):
If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Check them out at sidebar.com/lenny.

(00:33:52):
As a product leader, how do you think about just the time it takes to create a prototype in something like this? As a pm I'm just like a lot of times we don't have time to build this whole prototype. We got to ship stuff, we got to hit these calls, we got experiments to run, we'll just build it and see how it goes. How do you think about making time for something like that?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:34:08):
If you're doing it right, it'll be faster and you need to have an engineering infrastructure that enables prototyping. So some engineering infrastructures are too heavy and they don't actually enable prototyping. We had a problem with our mobile apps that it was too hard to prototype and we actually redesigned our mobile apps until we got to the point where it was easier because our desktop app was pretty easy to prototype. But you have to have a layer of abstraction that enables you to do that, and you have to have engineers who have a prototyping mindset, and if you build multiple things and you have this mindset as I'm willing to throw it away, you write code that is never going to make it to production so you can just crank it out much faster and then you can see what works and then you build the production code. Until you actually get to your end goal of something working faster.

(00:35:02):
But you need the engineering team to have the same mindset. The product and engineering have to work together and design because design is just in it. Sometimes you can get design engineers who are doing the prototyping. So your first prototypes are like Figma prototypes, and then you get prototypes on real data. When I was at Google, one of our teams, a front-end team, I remember we hired a bunch of prototypers and our head of front-end engineering said to me one day, this is my secret weapon. This is how we move faster. So I do think it's a mindset shift and a tech stack shift.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:39):
We're going to talk about AI later, but it's also getting easier to build prototypes with AI. There's this video recently that went around on Twitter where an eight-year-old girl was building an app and in like 45 minutes, she built a chatbot using this product called Cursor. So I think that'll unlock a lot of great product on opportunities and just accelerate this sort of work. I asked about Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield. I'm curious if there's another leader you've worked with that maybe is less known that you also learned a ton from that might be worth talking about.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:36:12):
I think that there are people who are really, really good at what they do. So Marc Benioff is an amazing marketeer. His marketing mind ... After the acquisition, I got the opportunity to onstage with him at Dreamforce for ... Because Slack was a new shiny thing so of course Slack was going to be in the keynote. And so I was in the Benioff's keynote two years in a row. And so I watched how he approaches his keynote and the whole thing around Dreamforce. Dreamforce is incredible at the impact that it has on the ecosystem. And so I think that as a product, people don't think of him as much, but as his marketing abilities are amazing what he's done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):
I've written posts about how various companies got started in Salesforce history. Always comes to mind where they go to conferences where's there's no software mascot walking around. And I remember they did something around one of their competitors where they just created some real controversy around someone.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:22):
Well, they went into their competitor's conference and stood outside their competitor's conference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
Mm-hmm. Right. That's what it was.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:29):
This is in the Beyond Software. This is in his book that he wrote about the early phases of Salesforce. And it takes his guts. He pushes the envelope.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
I love that. It's a really good point that people don't think of Marc Benioff as a marketer. And that's interesting that that's maybe the main thing you took away from him is just the power of marketing and the skill.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:49):
He approaches his marketing presentations like a product person approaches their building their product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):
Amazing. Okay. Speaking of former colleagues, I asked one of your former colleagues, his name is Fuzzy Khos. He's now the CTO of Notion. You worked with him, I believe at Slack.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:59):
And at Google.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):
And at Google. Wow. Okay. So I asked him what to ask you, and he said that you're amazing at building strong cross-functional relationships, especially with engineers. I know you used to be an engineer, so I get where that skill come from. What can you teach people about building stronger cross-functional relationships, especially PMs to build better relationships with their engineers, designers, other folks on their team?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:38:34):
Probably the most important thing that a product leader does because if you have great ideas of what to build, but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So one, make sure somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. So Henderson was the co-founder and CTO of Slack, and I couldn't have asked for a better engineering partner. He's just awesome. And that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join or you know that it's not the right one and the organization is willing to make a change. So that can happen too. You can go in and understand that something has to change, but that is a very, very important thing of what you're doing and what you're assessing when you go in. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned.

(00:39:29):
You don't want any of this ... People in the organization, they asked Mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other, that doesn't work. So one, you have to know that you're not going to do that. So if somebody would ask me something that it was in Cal's domain, I'd be like, "Did you talk to Cal?" I would never try and go around him. So we were very clear on, you're going to drive this, I'm going to drive this. And if it was unclear, we'd talk and we would say, "Okay. Who's going to take this one?" And we would do all our reviews together. And so all of the OKR reviews, we had weekly exec reviews, we had the updates on our OKRs, so we did them all together, but I knew here's the things that he was going to ask the questions on and dig deep. And then when I was, he would take a back seat, but of course we could ask questions in each other things, but I knew that he was taking ownership and he knew what I was taking ownership of.

(00:40:24):
But I think the bottom line was respect. Is that you have to respect and trust that they actually will follow up on what they say they will. In Cal and Fuzzy were amazing at that. I would go to Fuzzy and be like, "Hey, we need more mobile engineers because this one product is not going to ship." And he's like, "I'm on it. Got it." And that was all I needed to do. And obviously if he couldn't do it, he'd come back to me and, "Hey, there's going to be a problem." But it was like just things got done. That's the best part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):
You talked about being aligned, which I love and I fully have seen that power of that of you and your engine manager, design manager being aligned on ... And you tell me if I'm wrong, but specifically on what goals you're trying to achieve, what success looks like, things like that. Are there any tactics you found to create that alignment? And also if there's anything else you want to add to the point I just made about what it is you're specifically aligned on, that'd be great.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:41:19):
One, you got to spend a lot of time together. There isn't a way around that. And you have to document things and make sure that you've talked it through. And if you don't agree with something and you're not sure it's a priority, you have to speak up and you can't just be like, "Okay, whatever.", and then go to somebody in your team and be like, "Oh God, that that CTO, why did he make this decision?" That just doesn't work. So I'm a very direct person. So if I don't think that something is the right priority or is working, I will be very clear. We had different forms, so I'll be very tactical here on the forms that Cal and I had together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
Perfect.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:42:00):
We used OKRs to drive our processes and we would have the teams present OKRs to us. When the team got too large, it got to be too much time to go through every team's OKR review so we had a Slack channel for each team, their OKRs, a planning channel for each one. And people would post a doc and then a Slack video of going through the major points. And we had a time limit of how long they were allowed to be. And they would say, "Here's our OKRs, here's the things that you would pay attention to." And then Cal and I would do a marathon and we would watch them all together. And-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
In a room sitting there watching them together?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:42:38):
Correct. And then we would say, "Do we have any follow-up questions?" And we put in channel our follow-up questions to the team. And sometimes there'd be five to 10 teams that we would then have a follow-up meeting with. We would say that this is a really high priority project or there are a lot of questions that we have, and then we would do a meeting but we were always doing those meetings together. So that was the OKR reviews of getting the alignment. And by asking the questions, we could then ... By it just being us, we could dig into the team. And we each had a chief of staff, so it was the two of us plus our two chiefs of staff, and which they also did a divide and conquer and they worked really well together. They were both long time Slack employees. So for years they had ... One had been an engineering director and one had been a TPM. And then every Monday we had a Monday meeting where we reviewed the progress on the top OKRs and red, yellow, green and don't talk through the green ones, only talk through the red ones and what are the issues. And again, both there. And then we had a weekly meeting with the four of us where we would just go through any issues in the organization, what's going on, what's not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:50):
And the four of us is you, the CTO, the chiefs of staff.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:43:54):
Yep. And sometimes we would invite people. Like there's an issue with QA, so we'd have the QA leader come in and present to us. But we tried to limit the number of meetings with teams. So it'd be like the Monday meeting was the big meeting that you had to be there and you had to be able to talk to your project and that was it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
There's so much awesomeness here. I love the idea of this Async share your plan in a video instead of meetings with everyone in real time. And you could just do a lot of the stuff Async.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:44:22):
We iterated every quarter, just like you iterate on a product. So every quarter we would say did the OKR planning work or not, and then we would adjust. So we got to the point where at one point we added up all the hours of OKR reviews and all the people in them and it was some insane number, like 300 and something and we're like, "This has gotten out of hand." So then we're like, "We have to do something drastic." And that's when we moved them to Async. It was also right after Slack Clips launched.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:51):
Got it. That's the video feature. Very cool. Then I know you launched huddles, right? Slack Huddles? Did you use that as a part of this or eventually you just get people into a little huddle asynchronously and talk-

Tamar Yehoshua (00:45:01):
Sometimes. Absolutely. We would be in the reviews and we would huddle with somebody to ask a quick question. We use Huddled all the time. I still do. I love Huddles.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:09):
I love it. One crazy thing about Slack is people in Slack don't actually use email internally. It's like all in Slack. It's like the actual vision of Slack working within Slack.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:45:18):
No email unless you're dealing with somebody external. And no, it's mostly Slack Connect anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:24):
Anyway. Wow, that's amazing. Okay. I have one more question around product stuff and then I want to talk about AI. So I was reading your newsletter on Substack, which we'll link to and you share this really interesting insight that I've experienced myself that I'll quote you here. One of the mistakes that I see a lot of product managers make is they over index on people who are going to be unhappy with the products they're launching. And basically your advice is not to worry so much about making users unhappy, which I think is counterintuitive to some people. Can you just talk about this lesson and I'd love to hear what product you launched that made people unhappy that you realized, oh, maybe we don't need to worry about this as much.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:46:04):
I saw it more when you unlaunch things, you take things away there's always some set of users that are using a feature that nobody else does, and then you take it away and they're super unhappy, but there are more people you're going to make happy. So a product manager gets caught in this trap of the vocal minority and the number of people using your product ... Depends on what phase. Are you a Google? Are you Slack? Are you a Glean? But the number of people using your product today is usually unless you're a Google far smaller than the number of people who are going to be using your product tomorrow. So design it for the bigger number of people who are going to be using it tomorrow. If you have to redo the UI and the Who Moved My Cheese, people will be unhappy, but all the new people are going to be like, "This is so much easier." Then do it and deal with the people who are unhappy.

(00:47:02):
But the trick is you have to be respectful and you have to be transparent and you have to explain. You have to go to people and say, "This is why we made this change." And you have to be authentic. You can't be dismissive and you can't have marketing speak. You have to really say, "Here's for real why." And you have to listen to your audience. You don't want to alienate your early users because most people ... If you made a good decision on why you moved this or why we stopped using Slack calls and moved to Huddles and you have to do it over time and give people choice and then give them enough time to move. So you have to do it in the right way. But if people feel heard, it makes a difference.

(00:47:50):
I have an example that's not a product example, but I think is a really good one. It's a leadership example. So when I was at Google, there was always a controversy about something, but there was a controversy about ... It was Blogger or something. I can't even remember what it was. It was like we made a change. We were like 50,000 people at the time. There was an engineer in my team, an IT engineer that was super unhappy about the change. And I knew Rachel Whetstone, she was in charge of all of PR and global policy at Google. So huge job. And I emailed Rachel and I'm like, "Hey, do you have an FAQ or something that can help me? Because I don't know why you made this change and that I can help explain to the engineer in my team."

(00:48:33):
She did not respond to my email. She picked up the phone and she called him. I had no idea she did this. She just called this IT engineer and she listened to him and she heard why he was upset and she explained her reasoning. He was so blown away that she called him that he completely changed his opinion and then he told everyone else in the org. And so it had this effect. And I learned a lot from watching her do that. She never even told me she did it later. She just did it. You just act. You're authentic. You listen to people and you're transparent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):
It's so funny. This reminds me of a parenting book I'm reading right now that a former guest recommended called Listen. And the core thesis of the book is when your kids are acting up or they're getting off track, so much of what they need is a sense that you're connected to them, a connection which is rooted in you listening to them. And so all-

Tamar Yehoshua (00:49:34):
My favorite parenting book ... I don't know if this is the same one or a different one, it's How to Talk so Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kids Will Talk. Maybe it's the new name of that book, but it's so good and it's so true in everything and also in products. So whether you're in a forum and explaining to customers, whether you're enterprise customers, you're explaining, you're hearing them out, people want to understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:58):
Amazing. There's so many applications of just the power of listening. Okay. Well, not quite a segue, but let's talk about AI. You're at the epicenter of AI now with Glean. How do you anticipate AI will change our jobs and product? What do you think people may be aren't recognizing it, realizing it? What have you seen?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:50:21):
I'm going to give you a little bit of my history with AI to get to that point. When AI was a completely different technology stack ... I have a master's in AI. So I started working in AI when ... It's evolved so much. And then of course at Google using it for auto complete and search. It's transformed so many times. But then with this last transformation of GenAI ... And that's what brought me to Glean of seeing this, meeting lots of AI companies and like, "Wow. This is really going to transform how we work." And it's just fascinating seeing these products. I was one of those people like, "Oh yeah, it's going to be so far away." Until I saw GPT3. And I think AI, we are underestimating how much it's going to change how we work. It's not going to be sudden from today to tomorrow because people haven't figured it out yet. They haven't figured out how exactly to leverage it. But the people who have are going to be so far ahead. They're going to be far ahead of everyone else because they're going to be working faster, they're going to be working better.

(00:51:33):
And in five to 10 years, I think the lines between product managers and engineers and designers are going to blur because AI will enable product managers to build prototypes, to build designs. Designers to build a pro like Figma already has their Figma AI. You can press a button and you can get your initial prototype working. You've got all the co-pilots. So they're not quite there. You still, like with Copilot or with Cursor, you need to be an experienced engineer to know when it's getting it wrong, but they're going to keep getting better. I think people have to be careful about not getting left behind, but their jobs aren't going to go away. They're just going to change. I'm of the believer that we're just going to have a lot more software. But I talked to engineers and to PMs saying, "Yeah, I tried that. It doesn't really work." And then go back to how I worked before. And that's a dangerous spot to be in I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):
For people that get anxiety hearing this where they're feeling they're going to be left behind and like, "Oh my God, I don't know enough time to do this or I don't know what I'm doing here." Do you have any advice for what's something someone can do to not fall behind?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:52:48):
Use the products. This is what good PMs should do period. Always be using new products. It's not a unique thing for AI. When mobile came out, PMs needed to be using mobile apps all the time to try them out, see what the UIs are, see what's working and what isn't. And the same goes even more for AI. Use ChatGPT. If your organization has Glean, use Glean. Use Claude. Try them all. Try them and see what they do. I was talking to a product manager I know who is more forward-thinking and loves playing with new products and he had this use case that blew me away. So he said ... And this was a couple of months ago, so before ... It was right when Gemini had expanded the context window. So his product had a Discord channel and he took the transcript from the Discord channel, which was huge. And he fed it into Gemini the entire channel and then used it to ask questions. Like what is the sentiment of my product? What is the most requested feature? What are the things people are unhappy with? This never would've occurred to me. It's like, that is so smart. And he's like, "It was like a goldmine." Do you know how long it would've taken him to read? And he just wouldn't have done it.

(00:54:06):
So think about for the argument, oh, I'm too busy. Well, if you use these products it's going to be a leverage on your time. So you get a lot of articles sent to you, summarize them, use AI to summarize the articles. We use Gong at Glean to record all our sales calls. We have a Glean app that will read all the Gong transcripts, put them in a spreadsheet in a certain format of who the AE is, etc. And then summarize all the top requested features from all the Gong calls. And it took a while to get it right. At first the summarization, the prompt wasn't good enough and would give us features that our salespeople would recommend and didn't distinguish that this was actually the customer. So you have to tweak it. It's not going to work out of the box. But then we got it to the point where it worked and these things really save time and you have to use your creative juices as a PM to figure out how it can help you and have patience to iterate and keep trying because the models that we have today can do a lot already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:22):
Yeah. I love your example of the PM and what they did with the Discord channel. Is there anything else along those lines that either you've done to leverage some AI tool to be more productive or folks in your team have done to be more productive youth, either your product leaders or other folks?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:55:38):
So many examples. So one that I did really recently is I wrote a prompt in Glean to help me get the status of features. And we have a Launch Cal, and you can look at Launch Cal it'll say a date. But then is it really the date? What are the outstanding issues? So it will look at our Launch Cal and it will see if there are any open year tickets, what the Slack conversations are and the customers who are beta testing it, bring all these together to tell me, okay, launch date is this according to Launch Cal, but here are all the open issues and here are the open conversations that people are talking about. So then it can give me the confidence level of the future looking. So I can run the prompt, just put in the name of the feature. So I don't have to read all of these channels.

(00:56:28):
So this is a prompt that I built two weeks ago because we're advancing our prompting capabilities. And so I was testing it out and I was like, "Ooh, I could do this." So that's another example and engineers are using it for automating part of the incident management of I got an incident, how do I see were their previous incidents that were similar to it, where they're not. And so these are the type of things you can look at to help you. But the simplest, simplest is there's so much news. Let me just paste in all of these things and summarize them. As a product manager at Gleam, here are all the latest news. What do I have to care about? What's impacting me and potentially competitive to any of the products that I have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
And putting that into say Claude or ChatGPT you're saying.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:57:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):
Yeah. I think that beginning of the prompt is something a lot of people don't know is the power of just giving it a role like you are a product manager at Gleam. From that perspective, give me this summary versus just summarize this and that ends up being really powerful right.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:57:42):
A hundred percent. And you can compare what is Claude's PR saying that ... They just launched Claude Enterprise. How is Claude Enterprise different from OpenAI Enterprise? Again, you can do it yourself, but these micro improvements in your productivity help. For my newsletter, I interviewed Claire Vo who came out with ChatPRD. And so product managers are using is. We're just starting to evaluate it internally, so I haven't personally used it yet, but it's super cool and you can use ChatGPT to do a PRD. And ChatPRD, it's more templatized and more frameworks of how to do that. And again, these things are going to keep getting better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
Claire's been on the podcast, she's going to be speaking at the Lenny and Friends Summit coming up October 24th.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:37):
Oh, cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):
Yeah. A crazy stat she shared. She's making six figures off this product that she builds on the weekends ChatPRD.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:45):
So cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
Incredible.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:46):
But it also shows what you can build with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
Right. It's just her. I think she just recently hired some engineers to help because she has three kids CTO at LaunchDarkly and just is building this on the side making a hundred thousand plus dollars. Incredible. I want to add a couple of things here. So one is for folks looking for ideas for how to use AI tooling for their PM job. There's a couple of posts I've written that I'll link to in the show notes just to put that out there of just a bunch of PM sharing, here's what I've done with these various tools. Another thought I'd love to get your take on. There's a lot of fear that the PM job be replaced by AI. And I've recently realized that it's the opposite. I think the PM role is the best positioned to thrive in the world of AI because if you just think about you have a tool that can just build a thing for you, just like you're staring at this blank thing that can build anything for you, which function would you think would have the best chance of asking it of what to build and how to articulate what to build best?

(00:59:47):
To me, it's clearly Product People. They're best at figuring out what to build, what matters most, where the impact's going to be what customers need. Not to say other functions don't also have the skills, but I feel like of all functions, PMs have the most of that specific skill. I'd love to get your take on that.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:00:01):
That. I think that AI, the one thing it's not good at is being creative. So if you're a PM who's doing the grout work, it's going to take your job away. But if you're a PM who actually is strategic and can pull the pieces together and be creative and think how you do something that it's going to differentiate. Because it's not going to give you that leak. It'll say, here's what customers are asking for, here are the problems today, but you have to figure out how to solve it. So in some ways it might weed out the good from the bad PMs. Because there are a significant number of PMs who are more just execution. And I think that part of the job hopefully will be lowered because I hope a lot more of the execution will be able to automate updating Jira and all these things that just take time and creating even little Launch Cals, which PMs have to do manually now. So hopefully a lot of that work goes away and then people can be more creative. And I think designers and PMs are going to blend because the best designers I've worked with are product thinkers and a lot of really good PMs can also design. It depends on what kind of product you're PMing for. So I agree with the caveat that it will become harder to be a great PM.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):
Wait, say more about that. It'll be harder to be a great PM because many PMs are doing things that are mostly project management and that's the stuff that-

Tamar Yehoshua (01:01:30):
Yeah. Let me rephrase. It's not going to be harder to be a great PM, but to be a PM, the not so good PMs jobs will go away. The great PMs will still have great jobs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):
Yeah. I totally hear you. So in a sense there might be fewer. You might need fewer PMs, but I think that applies in theory to every function. Fewer engineers. Fewer designers.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:01:49):
I don't think you'll need fewer. I think you'll be able to do more things. Think about every company. Our head of sales came to me the other day, "You need to hire more engineers because we just have so many things we need to build." I'm like, "When have you ever worked in a company where you thought that you didn't need more engineers?" You always want people to build more stuff. So I don't think you're going to need fewer. I think you're just going to get so much more done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
A lot of people are building AI into their product. Glean is obviously an example which integrates LLMs, which innately are non-deterministic and hard to know if they're going to provide anything good. Sometimes something really dumb comes out. Do you have any advice on working with these very complicated systems that don't necessarily ... You can't control and building them into your products? Anything you've learned that might be helpful?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:02:41):
My first week at Glean was eye-opening in learning some of these things. But let me first just explain what Glean does for people who may not know. So Glean was started as enterprise search. Glean reads content of all your SaaS apps. So it reads the content from Microsoft, Google, Slack, Salesforce, Jira, like any SaaS tool that you use, it indexes it and enables you to search. So it started as just enterprise search and using AI. So it was an AI search using BERT models and using vector embeddings in 2019. Because the early engineers at Glean came from Google and Google created BERT to enhance search. And so it was obvious that they would be using ML techniques for search. Then GPT3 came along and added a natural language interface, a chat interface. You can ask the question in actual language and get an answer, and it basically is a knowledge graph of your organization. So you can ask any question. Think of ChatGPT for your enterprise. Ask any question about your enterprise.

(01:03:45):
So people understand search because they understand Google and you put in a query and then you refine it. But chat interfaces, people still don't really know how to use. If you look at the stats from ChatGPT, from what I understand, the retention is fairly low. People use it, they play with it, and then they don't get back to it because it's not in their workflow and they have a hard time figuring out what they can and can't do for it. When I got to Glean the first week I met with the assistant quality team and one of the biggest issues they have is people trying to use Glean for things that there's no way it could know. Like what should my top priority be next week when we don't even know what your priorities are. But then there's golden cases that are just amazing.

(01:04:44):
The example of refining queries and searched years for people to understand how to do. And it took a lot of features of auto complete and refinements at the bottom of the page. So we need to build in those things, guardrails to help with the change. To help suggest, oh, Lenny, here's what you could do. Here's a prompt to find out the status of your feature that Tamar built. So how do you give people guardrails so that they understand what is going to work and what isn't going to work? Because this whole, I don't know what I can ask. And then on top of that, the non-deterministic. An enterprise CIO will go use ChatGPT on the weekends, but they come to work and they expect their software to be deterministic. So how do you help educate users about that?

(01:05:34):
And then the other thing I'll say about using LLMs is the industry is transforming so rapidly that you need to make sure that your product gets better as the LLMs get better. And that too many people are building things to make up and compensate for the LLMs that all that work is going to go away. So it's okay to do it to understand that it's going to go away, but that can't be your differentiator. You have to understand that your differentiator is something that will continue to be there as the LLMs get better and smarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
And as part of that, because the LLMs get so much smarter, everyone else will become awesome. And to keep up, you need something that is actually outside of the LLM that continues to differentiate you and is better than what other people are doing.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:24):
Well, yeah. That your whole product gets better as the LLMs get better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):
That makes sense.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:30):
It's a frame of a of mind of how you approach the value add you're having.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Awesome. Tamar, to close out our conversation, is there anything else that we did not cover that you think is important to share or you think might be helpful to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:51):
I in my decades of working in tech, have never been working in an environment that's moving so quickly and it's really exciting. It's super energizing and it's also scary. But you have to change how you're working. You have to change how you're working so that you can keep up because it's going to be an interesting decade ahead with all these new tools that are coming out. And staying ahead will be hard, but it's also, there's so much I think richness and opportunity here. So I advise people to get in the thick of it and try it out because you'll be surprised at how many products we can build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):
I love that. I can't help but drill in one level deeper. Is there anything you found to help you stay ahead and help you stay aware of what's happening? Are there newsletters you find useful? Chat, podcasts that just help you keep up to date on where things are going? Is it like a person you look to like, "Hey, what's new?"

Tamar Yehoshua (01:07:56):
There are definitely AI newsletters that I look at. There's AI podcasts that I listen to. I now have a commute, so in some ways that's good because I get to keep up on the AI podcasts. So I just try and listen. I'm trying to build some prompts for myself to make it easier to say ... Take in ... I haven't perfected this, but the ChatGPT voice mode where you can load it. Somebody who I just hired it at Glean was saying he does this. He loads up stuff before his commute and then he'll be like summarize these articles and then he can ask questions to it. So I need to up my game there. But I definitely have a list of Ben's Bites and The Neuron. Those are good summaries and I like Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast. I listen to Cognitive Revolution. There's too many of them right now, but I pick and choose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Awesome. Okay. We'll link to those ones you just mentioned in the show notes. We'll have Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast, it's called No Priors. I was actually just listening to it on the way here. Sarah is going to also be at Lenny's and Friends Summit. She's going to be moderating a panel between Kevin Weil and Mikey Krieger who are the CPOs of Anthropic and Open AI. So there we go. Another quick plug for lennyandfriendssummit.com. I think it's lennyssummit.com.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:15):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
With that Tamar we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:21):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:23):
Okay, let's do this. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:29):
So one book was recommended to me by Shashir, the CEO of Cota. When I started at Slack, he recommended the book Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath. And it's such a good book. And it's about how do you set a path for people to follow. It's the whole elephant and the rider. So setting the path but yet motivating people to go down the path. And I read it. We had an all hands about ... I don't even remember the topic. It was something that we were like all up in arms about that we had to do. And I had just read the book and after the all hands I went up to store it and I'm like, "You did that all wrong. You need to read this book. That is not how to get people motivated." And he read the book and he's like, "You're right." So it just changes how you think in organizations to affect change. So that's on the organizational leadership. And one book I really liked was a Team of Rivals. It's a book about Lincoln and putting together his cabinet during the Civil War. One, I just learned a lot about the Civil War that I didn't really know. And it's about, again, a book about leadership and it is fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):
I don't think anyone's recommended either of these. So love them. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:00):
I don't know if you like British murder mysteries.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
I don't know either.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:07):
It's a niche thing, but there's a guy named Anthony Horowitz and the latest series he did was called Magpie Murders. And it's just an intricate story so I enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Very niche but amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:26):
Well, I'm going to give two. One is tech and one is non-tech. So non-tech I really like dark chocolate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
Actually just like a dark chocolate bar.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:38):
A really good dark chocolate that's simple. Like no frills, none of this. Just dark chocolate. And I discovered this chocolate called Bisou chocolate. It's a guy in Oakland who makes it himself. Super niche. He was selling at the farmer's market. And it's just like if you want like a simple play, no nuts, no anything just-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
No sea salt.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:12:03):
Great pride in the beans he resources them from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
Wow. It's called Bisou with a B?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:12:08):
Yeah. Bisou as in Kiss in French. And then on the tech side, the honest answer is Glean. I was listening to your podcast with Nikita who said that people over 22 don't use new products except at work. And that stuck with me. The new products I usually use are at work and I use Glean 10, 15 times a day. I use it so much and it changed the way I onboarded. It changed the way I work. Even the simplest questions, you don't bother people, you don't interrupt people on Slack. You're like, "What's the latest status with this deal? What's the last time we talked to them?" I meet somebody at a conference and I can quickly say, "Have we ever talked to this company before?" And I can just get an answer. Or without asking an engineer, "Where's the latest design doc?" It has really transformed how I work. So I know it's cheating in that it's the product I work on, but it's the actual honest answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:10):
And for folks that haven't heard of Glean, it's one of the most successful B2B AI companies out there. It's like a very large successful business and company that if you haven't checked it out, you should definitely check it out.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:13:24):
As our investors say, it's one of the AI companies that's actually making money.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):
Very few of those. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, repeat yourself, share with friends or family and work or in life?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:13:41):
I have one that my father told me when I was being really indecisive about what college to go to. He was really bored of the conversation and he said, "There are no right decisions. You make a decision right." And it is so true. Because you never know what's going to happen in life. You just have to commit to whatever you're doing and have no regrets about it. You can't be like, "Oh," 10 years later, "what if I had taken that job over there?" It's like you make your success based on how you approach the decisions that you've made.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:18):
So if you feel regret about something, this is a good one to pull out of just I will make this the best I can make it, and that's all the best I can do.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:14:27):
You can move forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:29):
Move forward. I love that. Last question, I know you're a parent. I'm a new parent. I have a 14-month old at this point. Is there a piece of parenting advice that you learned early on that you think might be helpful to me or folks that are new parents or something you've just learned yourself that you think might be helpful?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:14:46):
14 months. I think the best parenting book I read besides the How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kid Will Talk is, I think it's called Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby. We are much happier when we sleep well. We perform better at work when we sleep well. Children need to sleep. So making sure that they sleep well. And sometimes that's like, I did the whole sleep training, cry until you fall asleep and my kids still speak to me. So it was okay. That is the basic things. Make sure that their basic needs are met and then as they grow up, share your life with them. So a piece of advice I was given was analogous to Talk so your Kids Will Listen is when they had come home from school. You can't just say, "How was your day?" Say, "You know what? I did a podcast with this person and it was super interesting because they talked about this or that." Or, "I'm massively screwed up and I should have asked them this or that." And they'll be like, "Oh my God, I was at school today and this is what happened." If you share your life with them, they will share their life with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):
Such good advice. I really appreciate it. Tamar, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. We got through so much great stuff. Everything I was hoping we get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to read up on more stuff that you share and just follow you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:19):
Find me on LinkedIn and I have a subject called Practical Intelligence where I've been interviewing practitioners who are working with AI. It was my way of learning. I started when I was a VC. Trying to continue doing it. And how can I be helpful if you are a customer of Glean, I'd love to know what you think, what works and what does more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):
What's the best way to share that with you? Is it like messaging on LinkedIn, subscribe to Substack?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:45):
Message on LinkedIn, or comment on your-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:49):
On [inaudible 01:16:50]. Yeah.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:51):
Yeah. Those would probably be the two ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):
Awesome. Tamar, thank you so much for being here.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:56):
Thank you for having me.

# Hard-won lessons building 0 to 1 inside Atlassian | Tanguy Crusson (Head of Jira Product Discovery)

## Transcript

Tanguy Crusson (00:00:00):
Been in the product management team at Atlassian for roughly 10 years now. I worked on HipChat and Stride, and more recently I started Jira Product Discovery.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):
Why is it so hard to start new products, go zero to one within large companies?

Tanguy Crusson (00:00:13):
The company has a tendency to over-invest. Startups have the benefit of starving, and so you need to create scarcity. What we try to do is remind everyone things are going to fail, let's not drag the rest of the company into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Sounds like one of the biggest lessons is super silo sort of team.

Tanguy Crusson (00:00:28):
I needed the rest of the company to go away so we could get the autonomy to test the things that we needed, but it's not going to scale. That is not going to respect all design guidelines.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
The biggest challenge I think a lot of companies have is just, it's been six months, no one wants this, we're going to kill it. How do you protect that?

Tanguy Crusson (00:00:41):
Be very clear about what we're testing, doing that with data, doing that with personal customer stories, give people a sense of velocity and speed. No one wants to fuck with a high-speed train.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today, my guest is Tanguy Crusson. This is a really unique and important episode because we get into something you don't hear much on podcasts like this, the real talk challenges of trying to innovate and build zero to one at a large company like Atlassian. Tanguy has been at Atlassian for over 10 years and has worked on a bunch of internal big bets, some that have worked and some that have not, including products like HipChat, which I was a huge fan of back in the day, also a product called Status Page, and most recently Jira Product Discovery, which is one of the fastest growing products in Atlassian history that Tanguy led from idea to launch. We go through each of these stories, and Tanguy shares what went wrong, what went right, and everything that he's learned about creating space for innovation within a larger org, including how they structured their internal incubation program called Point A.

(00:01:45):
There's a ton of gold in this episode and a bunch of really interesting stories, which is part of the reason that it went this long. It's the longest episode I've done yet. If you're looking to create change in your organization and foster more innovation, this episode will be worth your time. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Tanguy Crusson.

(00:02:13):
Tanguy, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Tanguy Crusson (00:02:21):
Thank you very much for welcoming me here, Lenny. I'm actually super proud to be on this podcast. I've been a huge fan. Whenever I get the chance, I listen to you when I drive somewhere so yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:31):
What we're going to be talking about in this episode is we're going to be talking about building new products and going zero to one within larger companies, and in particular, the pain and the challenges that come along with that, but also the lessons that you've learned from doing this many times and seeing it done many times. You've seen a lot of this happening at Atlassian, you've been there for over 10 years at this point, and Atlassian has, I don't know, over a dozen different product lines at this point, something like that. I know a lot of people come to you asking for advice on how to build zero to one within a large company. So let me just start with a general question of just could you just share a bit about your history of building zero to one and just seeing zero to one happening within Atlassian?

Tanguy Crusson (00:03:14):
Yeah, so like you said, I've been in the product management team at Atlassian for roughly 10 years now, and I've been working mainly on bootstrapping new things. Initially, I joined to start the cloud developer ecosystem so developers can build apps on top of the Atlassian platform and sell them on the Atlassian marketplace. I worked on HipChat and Stride. HipChat was well-known, Stride less so. We were trying to win the enterprise communications market before Slack and Microsoft Teams came about. I did lead a business case to invest more in IT operations, got nowhere with it than we acquired Statuspage, Opsgenie, and something I tried to do with didn't quite get off the ground. More recently I started Jira Project Discovery, which was part of our internal incubator for two to three years, and came out of the incubator and generally available a year ago.

(00:04:13):
My track record at Atlassian has been 50/50 at best. Jira Project Discovery is actually my first, what I would call big success here. That one worked, but it was hard and all the ones that I worked on before were really hard to, and that's the kind of stuff that really bothered me for a super long time. The good thing is working on a product for product managers, I got to talk to a lot of product managers and across all sorts of industries in the past three to four years, and I realize that 50/50 is actually not that bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):
Awesome, and I know there's going to be a lot of real talk in this conversation. I'm excited to share and hear all these stories.

(00:04:52):

(00:05:45):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(00:06:16):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:07:04):
Just broadly, why is it so hard in your experience to start new products go zero to one within large companies? What have you seen are the biggest challenges and hurdles generally?

Tanguy Crusson (00:07:14):
Yeah, so on the opportunity side, so Atlassian, 300,000 customers. We play in a whole bunch of different markets, everything in the collaboration space. We have a lot of markets that we play in, which means that we've got a lot of competitors. But basically when we look at the areas we could go in, there's an endless list of areas that we could go in, play and have a decent chance to win. Much harder to do if you're a startup. The breadth that we've got makes it easier to try find areas where we could expand into. We're not starving like a smaller company, so we can actually afford to try to play somewhere, to do some bets, to have some of them fail and some of them succeed, so that's amazing. Now our customers, I said 300,000. The thing that I admire the most about the Atlassian business model is it's very broad. It's across small and medium-sized companies. We have startups using our products, and we've got also enterprises and very large enterprises using the same products, which means that there's a lot of areas where we could find a niche and go after it and expand progressively into all these areas so there's a massive distribution potential that comes with that. When I worked on Jira Product Discovery, I didn't start with, okay, I'm going to need to start finding product managers and it's going to be how to find them. No, they were already all using Jira. Atlassian is a company that has a relatively deep organization hierarchy but relatively flat decision making. So it's more like a, imagine a network of key decision makers across the organization. It doesn't really matter the job title or whether you are a manager of people or not. The decisions are made by people who drive change.

(00:09:02):
So there's a lot of empowerment that comes from that, but also it's a mix of top-down, bottom-up happiness I'd say. And so it can feel really chaotic at first, but once you know how to navigate it, it's actually pretty easy to try to go after something that you care about. And of course, we're a big company, so there's lots of ways we can get help. Corporate development, research analysts that we can talk to whenever we want to explore something, thousands of customers that I just have to put something in the addressable community group and get hundreds of people applying to talk to me from one day to the next. So that's amazing, any startup would want that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:45):
This sounds like how can anything not work when you launch a new product? You have 300,000 potential customers to launch it to. You have all the resources to build it. It sounds like decision making is efficient relatively, it's flat. You have all these different customer segments that use all these different version product lines of Atlassian. It's just like all of the opportunity possible to launch new products and still, many things do not work out, so I think this is a really important point and I think many big companies are in this. We have so much opportunity. Everything we're going to build is going to, it's going to grow like crazy because we have everything we need, but still it doesn't work out. And that's why I think we're going to talk about, it's going to be so important.

Tanguy Crusson (00:10:27):
It's going to be a little bit of therapy for me. Hopefully some people out there could go, "Okay, it's not just me having a hard time." It can happen in companies like Atlassian too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:38):
Amazing.

Tanguy Crusson (00:10:38):
So yeah, let's talk about the challenges.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
Let's do it.

Tanguy Crusson (00:10:41):
Yeah, for that. So you want to start a new thing. This thing is going to take time, and you need to be able to have that time for the time it takes until you can prove whether there is a thing or not. The thing inside Atlassian is that the path for success is super high for a new bet. If you come in and you create a product and it's got 100 customers, it's going to look cute. Remember, we serve startups and enterprises, we have self-service and sales, we've got all these motions that are in place for our bigger products. A $100 million business is a good start basically. In most companies out there, $100 million business is a home run. For us, it's not like that. We're trying to build businesses that grow really big and keep growing big over time.

(00:11:36):
Now, evaluating success can look very different between early stage and established products. For a long time at Atlassian, we were treating everything a little bit equally in that the metrics success for the same. For example, things like monthly active users is the way that you, for a long time we looked at you go, is that product being successful on it? And what if you are building an "internal startup," your monthly active user number should look very low for quite some time up until you know that your product is ready to serve the vast majority of the customers that you want to put it in front of, so that they don't just look at it and go, "It's not ready for me."

(00:12:20):
They're going to try it and then they're going to churn and it's going to take forever to claim them back, so that makes it pretty challenging to try and start new things unless we've got the right metrics and processes and everything internally that can give room and breathing space for the bets to succeed internally. And for many years, we were not there. We started getting there more recently with the start of Point A, which was our internal incubator program, which is one of my latest that was successful. The ones before didn't have that, and I really struggled from that, and I see many companies struggling with that exact aspect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:58):
Amazing. Let's dive into an actual story. There's three that I want to talk about. There's HipChat, which you mentioned. There's Status Page and then there's the product you're working on now, Jira Product Discovery. So with HipChat, funny story, I loved HipChat. I was a huge user of HipChat at my startup back in the day. I can never forget the billboard that you all put out promoting HipChat where there's this little stick figure meme guy and it just said, "Why use HipChat?" And I thought that was the funniest thing, and the product was so delightful. There's just all these little emojis in there, and the idea with HipChat for Atlassian was basically to become the Slack killer, that was the vision.

Tanguy Crusson (00:13:39):
You just killed me. We were way before Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
Okay, so first mover advantage, amazing product.

Tanguy Crusson (00:13:47):
It works, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):
And it was an acquisition for Atlassian.

Tanguy Crusson (00:13:48):
It was an acquisition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):
Awesome. So let's talk about what went wrong with HipChat. What did you learn?

Tanguy Crusson (00:13:53):
All know Atlassian as company, as the tool that could almost have a, okay. [inaudible 00:13:57].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
Yeah, this is the therapy. The therapy session begins.

Tanguy Crusson (00:14:03):
Yeah, it's going to start right there. Me and everyone else from the HipChat team I can tell you. Okay, so yes, HipChat was an acquisition, team of 20 people or so. It was Slack before Slack was there. Great traction and lot of, it was a darling with startups. It was a new way to collaborate back then. There were a few of these smaller apps that were trying to do this thing. I remember actually joining Atlassian. Before that, I was working with financial services, banks and stuff like that, and we were big meeting to talk about stuff, or going to someone's desk to talk about stuff. I joined this company where my colleagues who sit on the same floor as me and on the same table, we talk over the computer via chat. I often felt weird at first looking over my shoulder to the person I'm currently talking to and we're having an argument, but we're doing it over text. Anyway, it might seem a bit cute to the people who had been born in the Slack world, but it was a major change back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:03):
Yeah, I remember that. I remember that, I was in the same office with my team and we're using HipChat to chat and it felt strange. Now it's completely normal.

Tanguy Crusson (00:15:10):
It's just normal, and Hipchat was one of the first to move there. Slack came out of nowhere. Company actually initially was focused more on gaming and they really took the market by storm. The growth numbers were dizzying when we're looking at them. And so at some point, Hipchat was left relatively alone for a while inside Atlassian. You're doing something good, so keep going after it. But with Slack, we now had to try to go bigger, so we started this thing called HipChat Go Big, the team, they recruited-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):
That was the name of the project? HipChat Go Big?

Tanguy Crusson (00:15:46):
Yeah, HipChat Go Big. And then it was HipChat Next Gen, there was a few different. Anyway, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:51):
Very clear. HipChat Go Big, I love it.

Tanguy Crusson (00:15:55):
Go big. But it was really a go big, lots of new developers, lots of new product managers, designers, the full company behind this product kind of thing. We tried to grow it very aggressively for a product that did not change that fast before it had reached good product market fit already, hundreds of thousands of users on a daily basis, and all of a sudden that you get a lot of people who want to make changes to it, to compete against this new threat. The platform is not so ready for so many people to work on it. And so we got to the inevitable, okay, it's too much tech, we can't do much about it so we made the decision to rewrite it. There's lots of literature around there around should you do rewrite? Should you not do rewrite? You ask me now, I tell you never. Trust me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):
That's what most of the advice is, never do a rewrite, and people still do it.

Tanguy Crusson (00:16:46):
Never do a rewrite, and there's good reasons for that. But basically we did that and out of it came up actually a new product called Stride, which was initially "HipChat next gen." The problem is that the product was great, but by the time we were done, Slack was just miles ahead of us. At that point, Microsoft launched Teams. I don't know if you remember this moment where Slack put an ad in the, I think it was The New York Times, copying the Apple versus Microsoft thing from ages before going, "Welcome to the game, welcome to the party, we'll welcome you competitors," and stuff like that and Slack got pretty much destroyed by Teams. We started coming because it was like Microsoft distribution advantage. Everyone in Office is going to get it. They're giving it for free as part of Office, it was unbundled I think a few months ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
Which is ironic because in theory, Atlassian also has that same advantage, right? You have all these products, you could bundle it.

Tanguy Crusson (00:17:46):
We are going to talk about that actually in a minute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):
Okay, great.

Tanguy Crusson (00:17:51):
Because that was what helped us, how we thought we would win, and it was how I think we lost.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):
Amazing. Let's get in.

Tanguy Crusson (00:18:00):
So anyway, this all happened, and in the end we executed the market. We sold HipChat and Stride to Slack and basically exited the enterprise communications market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:10):
Just to double down that, but you sold that to Slack and now Salesforce basically, that's the word ended. I don't know if people know that.

Tanguy Crusson (00:18:19):
Yeah, actually, it was noticed by the market in that as soon as we did that, our stock price went up. I think it was $60 back then and it went up to 70. I mean, that really sucked for us, the team working on it. First, no one tells you, but failure, everyone tells you failure is great because you learn so many things, but failure to start with really sucks. None of us here were really happy about this on the team because we had spent years, on my part, it was three years, but the people who were before that on HipChat was longer than that. Obsessing over it, obsessing over every detail, every customer conversation, every solution, should we rewrite, should we this, should we do that?

(00:19:07):
So many intense conversations, and from one day to the next, it didn't matter anymore. We had worked on something and that's it, that's the end. I'm sure many startups have been through that before. For me it was the first time it felt that personal, and the market the next day went, "Oh, you're stopping doing what you're doing? Awesome. Yes, 10 more dollars to your stock price." So yeah, there's a personal side to all the stories. For us, there was a bit like the seven stages of grief after we shut down HipChat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
How long was that period of mourning and stages for you and the team?

Tanguy Crusson (00:19:42):
It lasted a few months. I was not part of the decision making team for shutting down HipChat. I was one of the product managers on the team leading one of the three pillars. I got brought in, I think it was a month or two, a month before it was announced for the team to go, "Hey, Tanguy, by the way, just so you know, HipChat is no more, and now your mission is to find a new mission for the team after that."

(00:20:11):
We basically spend the next two, three months trying to make sure that the squads were created to fully own what they do there, to make sure that they're the ones talking to the customers, they're the other ones trying to come up with strategies, trying to come up with solutions and everything in that area. As long as it was people interacting with Atlassian products on other surfaces, everything was fair game, and so there was a lot of ups and downs and everything. I think it took about two, three months before we got back to a new rhythm. And some people, when we talk about it, were still scarred by it basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:49):
What are some lessons from that experience?

Tanguy Crusson (00:20:51):
Yeah, so the main one that I personally got from this, and it's back to the hypothesis that you talked about, which we have all these successful products, we can expand into this one which is, and I quote it, but it's just myself, don't eat your own bullshit, which is a mix of two things. We've got a company value that says open company, no bullshit. So we need to be able to talk about the things like they are, and we don't try to make things sound smarter than they are. We don't try to hide the truth, we go after that truth, and we don't hide stuff from each other. We share with everyone, we are open by default. So that's one of the values and we do a lot of dogfooding, so eat your own dog food. We do test our own software a lot.

(00:21:36):
I've noticed that sometimes there are things that we do while we tend to believe stuff because it's worked for us before, and we have this assumption that it's going to keep working for us forever. The founders keep telling us what took us here won't take us there. That's a thing we keep hearing over and over again. But it's very easy for teams when they see success of something to think that it's successful because of X, but X is not validated. That's where we go back to the topic we've got today, which is why is doing this in a successful company harder sometimes. Well, Atlassian was successful with the playbook, and the playbook was we've got people in developers or tech or IT. They choose Atlassian apps, they love them. They start to recommend them to people in the business, and we start to see adoption, bottom-up adoption across the company before people decide to standardize on Atlassian.

(00:22:43):
We made the bet that we can apply this playbook to this market, which is basically we can, from people to use Jira, introduce HipChat, and then people will go into HipChat first in tech teams, and then it will expand into business teams, and it'll go world to world basically from that. The thing is we didn't, in my opinion, do enough to validate that assumption early enough. We did a lot of work, a lot of work even on other things, even when faced with signals that this might not work. I do remember talking with a lot of customers who were like, "Well, we've got, the IT is on HipChat, but the business prefer Slack." And then we started to see those businesses choosing Slack, which is the, initially it was like the developers try things and they like it and then everyone starts to adopt. In that case, the Slack managed to create a very strong fund base in roles that were not tech and IT.

(00:23:48):
It was the moment where the consumerization of apps, that trend was starting to get really high. Slack really rode that and they focused everything in their experience to catch that. They gamified onboarding, they focused a lot more on the look and feel. They try to make it pleasant, modern, functional to use. There's a lot of stuff that we learned since then from what they did, we had missed that part. The part that I took personally from that is that there's a lot of assumptions in what made us successful, it doesn't mean that it's going to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:23):
Just I understand what you're saying, which is really interesting that Atlassian was really successful selling basically to the buyer within the org, the IT team because they had everything they needed. They checked all the checkboxes, but it turned out in the Slack case, it was the users that ended up having the most influence over what tool they'd opted.

Tanguy Crusson (00:24:42):
I'd actually phrase it more as both were going after the users. Atlassian was going after the users in tech teams, Slack was going after the users in business teams. And in both cases, what happened was a bottom-up adoption. The people on the other side, the business would prefer Slack, the developers, they prefer the HipChat. We did a lot of work in the streams I was working on. We're integrating with every developer tooling out there to make sure that every tool that they use goes into HipChat and from HipChat back to those tools. And basically, they can do a lot of work by seeing an activity stream in HipChat. Business? Eh, not so excited by this. Emojis, a lot of other things that may at some point I remember we were thinking those things were trivial. No, they were not trivial. It was just a different approach for using the tool by a different set of users that we did not talk enough to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:36):
So is the lesson here, don't underestimate the challenge you'll have convincing a new segment to buy your thing. You may think they're close or similar, but they're probably not.

Tanguy Crusson (00:25:46):
Yeah, that's one of them. The other one is what took you here is not going to take you there. And so go back and try to explain why you are successful today, and then if you think you can use the same thing on the next thing, find ways to validate it, find ways to test it. Don't just go and build on those assumptions. That's the main thing I got out of this ordeal basically for the stuff I did after.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):
How would you do that? How would you go about and test it? Is it use research? Is it the PMs talking to potential users? What would you have done there?

Tanguy Crusson (00:26:22):
For example, when we started Jira for the Discovery, which is, so maybe I should introduce this for a second. It's a product for product managers, which is mainly used for prioritization and roadmap. People use Jira to plan and track work when it's committed. We wanted to create a space before that so people debate priorities with everyone that should be involved in that prioritization process, whether it be the developers, designers, so people in the product team or people outside of it, customer success, salespeople, support, leadership and so on and so forth. When we started, that we thought, okay, the product managers are already in Jira. You know what? We can reach them. So we create the tool, and then we'll distribute it from Jira. We could have gone down the path of building that and then started to start to distribute it.

(00:27:15):
Instead, we did things like before we brought a single line of code, put an ad inside a Jira newsletter going, "Hey, we've got this thing for product managers coming up." And then we had a website that before we had any line of code written that said, "Hey, product managers, your job is hard. We want to help, put your name here if you want to join us on the journey," that kind of thing. And that's when we saw, I think it was in two weeks, we got more than 3000 signups to that waitlist. We're like, "Okay, cool. Validation of demand." We are talking to people who are interested and we can reach them. That's one examples of the things that I tried later, just to make sure that we validate the hypothesis that we've got much earlier on in the game basically, and not once it's too late.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):
Awesome. That's an awesome, very tactical example.

Tanguy Crusson (00:28:09):
Yeah, most of those are, none of what I'm going to talk about today is revolutionary. A lot of it is just trying to apply, asking the right question at the right time, and trying to go by whatever means to answer it really.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:22):
Any other lessons from the HipChat experience before we shift to a different product?

Tanguy Crusson (00:28:26):
I've got two, I'm going to do them quickly. The first one is competitive myopia, don't fall for it. At some point, the Slack was really gaining round and gaining round and capturing more of the mindshare. And everyone on Twitter was always loving them. Even when they had outrages, they were getting congratulated. I was like, "This is working mad." But the love was so strong, and the way we tended to revert back is to our functional side of the brain going, okay, we just need this one more feature. We just need this one more feature, we just need this one more feature. And we ended up reacting to whatever.

Tanguy Crusson (00:29:00):
... more feature. We just need this one more feature. And we ended up reacting to whatever the competitor was doing, which I think is really, really bad because that's when we lost basically what made HipChat successful so far, which is to serve some users really well. And instead we ended up fast following based on what the competitor was doing, which is super bad because your competitor, if you think of what they do as an iceberg, the top side, what comes out of the water is what they've shipped in terms of features, but it's based on all this stuff that they've built in terms of research and understanding of their customer base and everything else. And so you're just seeing the manifestation of what they were thinking maybe a year ago, based on what they're shipping now. But we got there.

(00:29:44):
And now whenever I work, I tend to try and ignore competition other than watching every three months or so, seeing what came out, if there's anything we should be worried about, afraid of, stuff like that. But really just try to disconnect all the creative process and the research process from what competitors do, because you can't compare. The market is huge. There are hundreds of thousands of companies out there. Not everyone has the same needs. We serve a particular set of segments. We would do better learning from them to then expand to the others than watching what competition is doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:21):
And this is advice you give to your teams, just ignore the competition, maybe pay attention at big announcements and things like that?

Tanguy Crusson (00:30:26):
We always see in the Slack Channels team sharing, okay, they just did this with AI, they just did that. So it keeps coming up, and so we often have discussions to go back, to okay, let's watch again the user interviews that we did over the past three weeks. Let's watch them all together now and remember who we are building this for. So there's a lot of trying to anchor back on what we know and how, basically building our own journey on it. And I think it's much richer for everyone to be involved.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:58):
I love that. So you're finding that when there's a big announcement and everyone's like, "Oh my God, look what Slack's doing," or "Look what this company's doing." It's like, "Okay, now let's spend a little time reminding ourselves what our customers have been asking us to do and let's watch a couple of user interviews."

Tanguy Crusson (00:31:11):
And even when there is something that competitors do that is right, remember, we're playing the long run and we don't always need to be first and shinier. We need to make sure that people have a problem, we solve this problem. They tell us, we solve this problem for them. They are delighted when we solve these problems for them. And so that's the stuff we should be obsessing about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:32):
I love that. And you said you had one more lesson from this experience.

Tanguy Crusson (00:31:37):
Yeah, the last one, startups have the benefit of starving. Right? We're a big company, we can throw a lot of resources at something that we're excited about. So this notion of we rebuild the HipChat, was coupled with we rebuild the HipChat and we'll do this on a new platform, which is microservices and everything that we built can be reused across all the other products. So the chat text box that you've got, it's an editor that can be open full screen and it's a Confluence editor with everything that you can do there. It's built as a platform component, which is amazing when the platform is there when you start building the product. Where it's really difficult is when you try to do the two at the same time. So I think that part, if I were to work on HipChat again and say I was leading that thing, that's the part I would go, okay, we need to win the problem space first, and if the platform is there, let's use it. If it's not there, we'll hack it, test it, iterate on it with customers, and then whatever is good there, let's platformize it later.

(00:32:44):
But that's where you see what makes us super powerful as a bigger company, can also slow us down and make us focus on the wrong assumptions. So in that case, I think we thought we will win. Interestingly, I think we were convinced that we had a great shot at this market. And at the same time we thought that we could tackle the rewrite and we could tackle the platformization. All these things were necessary, but all of them at the same time was probably a bit too much to bite. Now I'm saying that, but today the editor you see in Confluence started with what we did in HipChat back then. So I would say that in terms of code, purely in terms of code, 70% of what we wrote for HipChat is probably still in the Atlassian platform today. But for a new bet, local Optima, that was really bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:37):
Yeah. Just thinking about the fact that Atlassian could have had this $30 billion business if this worked out, and I could see why people would be frustrated that it didn't work out. So thank you for sharing that story. Let's talk about Statuspage, another journey that you were a part of, that also didn't quite work out the way folks had hoped. Our therapy session continues. Talk about what that product was and what happened there.

Tanguy Crusson (00:34:04):
Yeah, so this one is actually a success story, but became a success story after I was gone [inaudible 00:34:08]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
Okay.

Tanguy Crusson (00:34:10):
That's more like a story of big companies can play the long run and for you individually inside that process, it might look like a loss and you might feel like you're going nowhere, yet the company stays on the opportunity for long enough to make it happen. So what we're going to talk about here are my own challenges working through it for something that ended up being very successful in the end, but I felt as a failure personally back then. So Statuspage at some point... So Jira is used by developers, right? And back then, I think it was back in 2016 or even before that, 2015, everyone was moving to the cloud, everyone was adopting DevOps, you build it, you run it. So basically developers would implement the software and then they would put it to production. And after they put it to production, they don't throw it over the wall to operations people. It's the same developers who operate the software in production. They go on call, yada yada.

(00:35:12):
So back then I did market research to see whether Atlassian should play there, whether we had a crack at going after all the jobs around IT operations. So Jira was basically Jira software to build software. Could we have Jira for operations? So for operating this software. And so I did market research, found a few companies that were doing super interesting things there, like [inaudible 00:35:37], Opsgenie, New Relic. BigPanda was a small startup doing lots of cool stuff there, and Statuspage. Now I discovered Statuspage and found their offering super interesting, in that Atlassian is not an operations... We don't really build super deep operations tooling, what we focus on a lot is the collaborative aspects around everything. And when I was watching teams in incidents, I realized that there's a lot of chicken without a head syndrome, headless chicken, people running around like bunch of headless chicken.

(00:36:14):
Shit hits the fan, and then what you see is teams just scrambling and everything gets mixed up all together in trying to fix the problem straight away, but at the same time questioning what happened, arguing over why we got there. Your boss is pinging you to go, "Hey, what's going on? I've been hearing that the app is down. We're losing money." Customers are emailing you and asking you what's going... Your support channels get blown up. Sales people are worried because their customers are calling them. So basically, it ends up being a super stressful experience for everyone.

(00:36:48):
And what Statuspage was offering is something seemingly super simple, which is, well, what you should have is a status page for your services and you tell your customers about it and you can subscribe to your status page. Over there, you've got your services, and for those services you can publish an incident whenever there is one, and your customers will be notified, which means that they're not going to get in touch with support because they know you're on it. It's going to build trust with them because basically you are open in your communication with them. They're more likely to empathize with your position and be supportive as opposed to, "Oh, that stuff is done again." So there was just so many benefits of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:31):
I'm going to share a quick story while you're on this topic.

Tanguy Crusson (00:37:34):
Yeah, of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
Funny enough, a decade ago, I used to work at a website performance monitoring company and I started a blog called Transparent Uptime. And my whole blog was about the power of being transparent about being down, telling people the status of things are broken right now, here's when things are going to return. It was a whole thing I was really obsessed with, and I was deep into this space. So when I saw Statuspage back in the day and Atlassian working, I was like, "I love this." And I actually chatted with the founders a bit, because they were fans of that work I was doing back in the day. Completely unrelated to anything else I've done in my life. But I was really passionate about this very strange topic and I love that companies are embracing it.

Tanguy Crusson (00:38:21):
I really loved diving deep into it for a few years, it's an amazing topic. And so anyway, there's so many fascinating things about this particular domain, but back then... So find Statuspage and we invited a few of those companies to work with us for a week to go, hey, so we're at Atlassian, we're basically the collaboration hub for everything that happens for developing teams. What would an experience look like that puts everything together and where [inaudible 00:38:48] could actually help you get the right information to the right team so they can act on it?

(00:38:52):
And so we did a week of hackathon in San Francisco all together. So people from New Relic, Statuspage and a few other companies. And out of that came really interesting concepts and there was really something there and I was like, "Okay, I should start to work on a business case for Atlassian for basically IT tool/operations." Now, big companies like Atlassian, we've got money. So in every strategy that we've got, we've got cash in the bank, we always look at should we build, should we buy, should we partner? Acquisitions can be really powerful to accelerate you. We've got quite a few success stories there. Can't remember how many we did, but Trello is one of the good examples of that, for example. So we decided to buy Statuspage and I was running the integration of the Statuspage business inside the Atlassian business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:49):
Thanks for sharing all that context. What are some of the things that you learned from going through this experience? It sounds like basically it was really painful when you were a part of it and then it ended up being really successful. What are some lessons from the pain?

Tanguy Crusson (00:40:02):
My learnings from it were on the acquisition side. So big company, we've got cash, we can buy a company, it will make us go faster, is not always the case. In my case, there were quite a few things that were not as easy as I would've thought. The first one is the culture shock of a startup that joins your company. So imagine you're a startup, you've got, I don't know, 20, 30 staff or something and things are going well, and you are in full control of your destiny. And then a company buys you to accelerate you, but then you stop owning all the decisions. So the CEO, maybe you become a product person. The person who was running GTM but was also doing a bunch of product stuff, and was also doing a bunch of maybe engineering stuff, all of a sudden is just working in marketing.

(00:40:52):
There are decisions that are made above your head. For example, portfolio fit, which should be part of your product, which is things that should be used from the platform that we've got. So there's a lot of decisions that we're able to make on the day-to-day basis, that start to escape you. Big companies look much further out in the future. So Atlassian would look at the long game. And so I remember with Statuspage when they first joined, we asked about the roadmaps and they were like, well, for the next three months we're working on that and for the following three months we're thinking about potentially X, Y or Z. And so when we're like, "Okay, so what's the three-year plan?" They're like, "What do you mean the three-year plan? I don't know, we'll survive, I guess." Which is what startups do. And they were very penciled ideas about the future, but not to the extent of what a big company would expect. And so that's a really big culture shock.

(00:41:53):
And what you end up with as well, and that's for companies who are looking to get acquired out there or buying other companies, before, you had a startup and everyone was one team, depending on how the buying company is organized, you might land with silos from within your team. So the way Atlassian is organized is like many Atlassian companies, we've got a product organization, we've got an engineering organization, we've got a marketing organization, design organization, and they each roll up to a different leader which may then roll up to the same person, but still by and large different organizations that are then assembled into squads and those squads operate together. But there are rituals that are part of the squad and there are rituals that ladder up to where you are in terms of craft. So I do remember how daunting it was for the Statuspage team when they joined, to understand how to navigate that.

(00:42:47):
If I want to hire a new designer, I'm not talking to the Statuspage CEO anymore, I need to talk to the head of design for this area, which has pretty much nothing to do with the Statuspage business up until the acquisition. So that is the things that people told me when I started working on the integration, which is, hey, remember, you don't know yet, but integrations are mostly about people. They're not about technology as much or product vision. All of that stuff is the easy stuff. The hard part is the people. And I didn't quite understand at first and then I really got it by the end of it.

(00:43:27):
Because what we tell those companies is we can accelerate by buying, but in reality they are going to be faced with more internal processes around how they manage staff, performance reviews, this concept of engineering allocation, revenue forecasts, OKRs, long-term roadmaps, all that stuff comes in very new to them. So one part of the company top-down says, we bought you because you are successful, keep doing what you're doing. While many other teams without meaning to, basically end up constantly interacting so that the right processes are followed, so that the right things are done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):
That's a really interesting point, that one group is keep doing what you're doing. We're going to leave you alone, you're the experts. And then other people that are on the ground actually building it are like, "Hey, build with this component. Hey, we need this process, we need this document."

Tanguy Crusson (00:44:15):
And it's the things that you used to be able to focus 90% of your time working on your product, and all of a sudden all of that stuff may seem parasitical but comes in and interrupts you all the time. And often the new joiners, they don't know that they basically are not only being acquired, they've been hired by the company. So they basically are joining a different company with different sets of rituals, with a different culture. All of that is very different, basically. It's not going to be the same for every acquisition. Like I said, we had some acquisitions that were great. Statuspage ended up being a huge success inside Atlassian, but when I was there, I basically worked through the difficult parts of it, where I was like, "It's not as simple as people may think." So one warning, if you're planning to do acquisitions, make sure you factor all of that in and think about the integration plans to compensate for these aspects. So you don't expect the business to join and keep running at exactly the same pace, because going to be a big slowdown before it accelerates again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):
So maybe as a last question here, is just say you were to do an acquisition again and I don't know if you've gone through more, what's one thing you would change? What's one thing you'd recommend of let's make sure to do this thing very differently?

Tanguy Crusson (00:45:27):
One aspect that I'm going to talk about to then go there, but one aspect we didn't talk about which is we bought a product, how does that product fit with the rest? And so we had different types of acquisitions that we did. One is we buy the company and we keep the product running and then we try to integrate it with our tech stack. And then the other acquisition is we buy the company and then we kind of rebuild on our platform, or we buy with this huge synergy with our platform. And so we call that the frankenstack, otherwise. Which is, you get one tech stack here, one tech stack there and they can't quite talk to each other, identity is different, integrating is different. And so it looks like a patchwork of products and that's not what our customers want from us.

(00:46:09):
So the next time I try personally, I would treat it like hiring over treating it like buying business only. So there would be a huge component which is to both educate and tease out what it means to actually hire the team inside the company. At the same time I'm saying that because I don't want to do a big one. The next one I want to do is relatively small. Find a company that has amazing product that we can bring in as a tech-in, shut down the product, rebuild it on our platform and so it's basically the equivalent of an acqui-hire, because basically what we'll be buying is the acceleration of our roadmap.

(00:46:51):
We could try and form a team to do what they did, but they've been successful so they know what they're doing. We could probably get there one year faster. What does that mean for our revenue at the scale of Atlassian, if we can enter a market one year earlier? It's probably going to pay the acquisition back on its own. So my learnings from it were basically that it needs to be treated like hiring and what I would like to do next time is more doing it like that, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:24):
What about in the case of HipChat, where it feels like it was a mistake to rebuild a thing. Is there for this kind of startup, don't rebuild for this kind of startup? Start again. Do you have a thought of how you separate those two?

Tanguy Crusson (00:47:36):
There's actually a big difference. There's a big difference. Which is in one case what you try to do is.... So when you rebuild, you've got a successful business, you've got hundreds of thousands of customers, for example, and you're trying to rebuild the same thing or a different thing, but for the same customers that have got expectations about your current product. In the other one is you buy a company that's got some traction, not too much, so you can shut down the business and then rebuild on your platform to reach your customer base. So it's not the same as trying to rebuild the plane mid flight, it's delaying takeoff. It's like, "Yeah, we did a trial run, the plane landed. Okay, cool. Switch to another plane, takeoff again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:17):
Got it. I love that. Any other key insights and lessons from this experience before we get to your product discovery?

Tanguy Crusson (00:48:25):
One last one and then I'm going to stop with the therapy session, thank you very much for offering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:30):
No, no, we got to keep it going. I got to rack up the bill on this therapy session.

Tanguy Crusson (00:48:35):
Which is, remember I mentioned I was working on a business case for... Basically going bigger in IT operations. And so there was as Statuspage as part of it, but there was a lot of stuff that I wanted to be able to do inside Jira and a whole bunch of other products to basically go big in that area, IT operations, before Jira service management, which is a very successful product we've got around that. Before it was really entering that part of the market. Everyone was excited. It was before we had an incubator internally. And so I was trying to pitch it like let's build a new product that's centered around that thing. It's on Jira and it integrates with these tools that we discussed and we can put in Statuspage there and that's actually how we could accelerate them as well, and so on and so forth. Everyone was excited, thought it made sense, lots of encouragement. I pitched it to every level of the organization from business leaders, to the CTO that we had at the time, to the CEOs. No one said no, no one said yes. For months.

(00:49:44):
For months, I was in this limbo of, I think everyone's excited about this, everyone wants this to happen, but it's not happening. And so I remember talking with my boss at the time going, what's going on? When do I stop pushing? Because at some point I'm sure I'm going to start pissing people off. And he was like, "Well, basically when you lose the passion for it. Keep going up until you feel like it's not worth pushing anymore." And I remember looking at this advice and going, wow, that was not helpful at all, based on the situation that I was in. But basically at some point I basically gave up. What happens though, and I understood that after because the company ended up going there just a year later, was that I misread the appetite and sense of urgency around that topic and the fact that Atlassian being Atlassian, we invest in so many markets, we have many opportunities like this that sit on a shelf.

(00:50:45):
Someone did the analysis, someone created a business case, that thing makes sense. There may not be a trigger for the why now. So we need a very strong trigger for why now to go after it. And I did not do a good enough job at articulating this. Why now? Why do we have to do this now versus in a year's time, in two years time? And the next team that came in afterwards did a much better job at that. But for me, that was a great learning, which is great work can get parked and [inaudible 00:51:20]. And yeah, that's just what happens, which is because we have so many opportunities and there's many companies out there that are probably faced with that, doesn't mean that we have to go after all of them. But it does make sense to explore them, and then decide when to pull the trigger, and that rationale for the sense of urgency needs to be there. It needs to be beautiful to the business days.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:42):
This reminds me of my chat with Mihika, who does similar work at Figma where she works a lot of zero to one stuff. And she described it as your job is to keep the flame alive and help it spread throughout the entire business if you're trying to get everyone on board with a new idea. And I like this very tactical piece of advice you're sharing here of how to do that, is make it clear why this is.... I think of it as why is it perishable? Why is this opportunity perishable? Why is it going to disappear if we don't act on it now? And you could think of it as why do we have to do this now? It's not just like "This is a huge opportunity." But we also need to do it right now to give people motivation.

Tanguy Crusson (00:52:15):
Yeah, that was a huge learning for me. I wasted months on it, but like with every failure, learnings came out of it in the painful way. So product managers are often biased towards action, or at least that's my case. I want to go and do stuff and build stuff, and try stuff with customers. And so being idle, waiting for a confirmation is not a great spot to be, but sometimes you need to recognize when you're there and it's good to step back.

(00:54:09):
Let's try to summarize some of the biggest lessons so far that you've shared before we get to product discovery. So a few things I noted here, just how to be successful, building zero to one at a large company. One is be very clear, are the users you're going to be building this new product to actually the same users you're already selling to? And it may feel like they are close enough, but in the case of HipChat, you learned maybe not, and it's a lot harder than you expected.

(00:54:33):
Two is be careful when you rewrite. In some cases, shut it down, rewrite it immediately, accelerate this new idea internally. In other cases and you shared, and so you could rewind if you want to get the actual details of when it makes sense to go one or the other. Sometimes doesn't make sense to rewrite, just keep what you're doing and focus on the user problems and don't slow down. Another tip I wrote down is ignore the competition. Don't be obsessed with what they're doing. Focus on what your users are asking you for. And then this idea of paying attention to the why now, that's a really good one. Just like when you're trying to make a case, make it clear why it has to happen now. Is there anything else that comes to mind as I try to summarize some of the advice so far?

Tanguy Crusson (00:55:12):
No, that seems like a good one. The main one I'm getting also out of this, is if you try to start new things, it's going to be coming from your drive and your passion, and that's what pushes stuff forward. So don't give up. Because I try really hard before getting to one that worked. So I guess that's probably a testament for it's possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:36):
And a testament to your grit and desire to make something work. So on that note, let's talk about your product discovery. I know this is a success at this point. I know there was also a lot of pain that went into this and things that didn't work. So I'd love to hear both sides of it, just like what was hard about getting this off the ground and then also just what worked, what allowed you to make this work? So start wherever you want to start.

Tanguy Crusson (00:56:00):
Yeah, cool. So let's start with the good stuff before we go back into therapy. Some of the good stuff here is Atlassian at that point had recognized we are innovating in our big successful products all by doing acquisitions, we have to correct that and start building new products ourselves as well. And so there was a huge push from the founders to go, "Hey, we need to restart that." Out of it came Point A, which was an internal incubator program that was meant to fix that. And the way they framed it was that innovation is like a muscle. Unless you exercise it, it becomes weak, and what we have to do now is to work on it again. And so out of that thing, Point A and Jira Product Discovery was one of the... I think it was one of the 100 pitches that went through that innovation program. There were 100 pitches and out of it came out three products that basically went through all the different stages of it. And so it started with Jira Product Discovery was actually made possible because of that and because we're inside Atlassian. So we started with a lot of, I could take time to focus on this stuff with nothing else to do it. It was a full-time job, because of this incubator. I was able to form a team easier because there was budget allocated. I was able to form a team that was not worried about losing their job because the program was made so that technically speaking, you would borrow people from other departments. If that thing doesn't work out, they go back to your department. So there's no fear of losing your job, basically.

(00:57:34):
We were able to tap into all the research that was done by our research and insights team internally. We were able to have the corporate development team working with us. I met with probably 20 companies that played in things around product management before forming a view that, hey, maybe we should play there. And all those teams are willing to talk to us because Atlassian is a big player in this market. And so there's always the opportunity of integrating, being bought, partnering that can...

Tanguy Crusson (00:58:00):
The opportunity of integrating, being bought, partnering, that kind of stuff. I was able to meet with analysts to say, "Hey, so what do you think about the product management market?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):
This was all part of the Point A structure?

Tanguy Crusson (00:58:14):
So the Point A structure, not all of it was formalized in Point A, remember Point A back then was created alongside the first bets that went through it, and ours was one bet as part of that. So we forged the path for all the ones that came afterwards. But basically, it gave us the crags to go in and ask for help from everyone, and everyone knew it was important. Because everyone knew the company priorities and the new products were top company priority. And so Atlassian, playing the long game, had decided that it was okay to invest in these bets and to reassess them into every three to six months to understand whether we should put more chips in it.

(00:58:52):
And so the psychological safety of everyone's job was safe, coupled with access to all the resources from the company. That part was just invaluable to the success of what JPD is today.

(00:59:03):
So to give you a bit of context, Jira Product Discovery started four years ago with some research. I was alone back then, and then we were three. The first line of code was written three years before we launched officially, as generally available. Which means that for three years we were dogfooding alpha or beta and able to do that with the full support of the company. So when I mention the long game, I mean it. It's something that's very hard to get in most companies out there.

(00:59:36):
And when people ask me about how to stop incubators, it's like think about it with when you're going to get your dollars back and forget about it for a while. What you need to see is how the teams are answering the right questions that they ask along the way, and seeing whether you are still excited about the bets as they do that.

(00:59:57):
Anyway, so we launched a year ago. Fast-forward to today, we've got 8,000 customers, amazing CSAT, great traction. It's one of the fastest growing products in Atlassian history, which is great. So what was hard though, the first one was reminding everyone that failure is the most likely outcome. And I will die on that hill to explain to people when they want to stop things internally, frame it like that, remind everyone. There's a [inaudible 01:00:28] 70% chance, [inaudible 01:00:30] completely pulled out of thin air that whatever you're working on is not going to exist in six months.

(01:00:35):
We're trying to launch a new product, enter a new market. Our goal is to get to $100 million businesses. So there's not that many of them out there. We have tried and we have failed. And a few of them are Atlassian. And so remember that, and it's super important to remember that because otherwise the company has a tendency to over invest, not the company top-down, parts of the company have the tendency to come and try to help.

(01:01:07):
So for example, "Here, we want to build this." "Oh, if you want we could change this service to be able to XYZ for you." "No, we are a bet, which is seven people. Let's not drag the rest of the company into it. The appetite that the company has right now is these seven people. We'll see what we can do with these seven people," was what I was telling everyone.

(01:01:26):
The reason I was saying that is that, otherwise, yes, you get the help, but the help always comes with condition and the condition is usually things slow down. So what we try to do is remind everyone, things are going to fail, so that we could basically buy the opportunity to hack shit together that is not going to scale, that is not going to respect our design guidelines, that is not going to fit with the JIRA target architecture. But we're going to test this with customers and see if the concepts make sense, if the prototypes make sense, whether they get value out of those before we tell you, "Hey, you know what? That thing is a thing and by the way, now we're a proper business. We should build that thing into the platform."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):
This is really interesting because it's counterintuitive to think that you should position your new bets as, this is most likely going to fail. This is just the thing we're trying, don't worry, don't commit too much this yet, don't worry about giving us all these resources. Why do you think that's so important? Because I don't think most companies position new incubations that way. Why do you think that's so effective and more effective?

Tanguy Crusson (01:02:29):
Yeah. So the thing that we're trying to do when starting new products is to basically emulate a startup in an environment that is not hungry, is not starving. And so you need to create scarcity. What I wanted with my team is to make sure that they feel the urgency. That thing needs to move. I also needed the rest of the company to go away, so we could get the autonomy to test the things that we needed to know whether this thing is even going to work or not.

(01:02:57):
We could not go into a planning session for the next six months to negotiate something with a platform service so we can build a feature to then test with users. I said, "Now, we're rebuilding this component and we're testing this with customers next week. It's not perfect. It's not perfect." And so that helped us a lot, but otherwise there's always this tendency of the process that works for everything else is going to work for this and we do need to keep reminding them, "Hey, we might not exist in six months. Do you really care that much about this process right now? The product might not exist anymore." The process goes away usually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):
So it's basically a trick to keep everyone else within the org away and not worry about what you're building? Because you just tell them, "Don't worry, this is not going to work out. We're just going to try this thing just to see." So it's not for your team to feel like, "This is probably not going to work out." I imagine the team is like, "Oh, we got to make this work. It's such a good idea." It's more as a trick to keep the org from swallowing you up and pushing you around?

Tanguy Crusson (01:03:52):
So there's a part of that, but there's also really a need from... We need to respect Atlassian's dollars here, and if we don't know whether this thing is going to work... I do not want to drag a team of 50 people into this. I want to know that this thing is worth the investment of a team of 50 people. So it's a bit of both, actually. Now, it's of course, easier said than done. And so that's where, again, Point A helped. We had four stages called Wonder, Explore, Make and Impact, where in the first stage it was all about proving that there was a problem area we could go into, there was a market.

(01:04:27):
We could answer very clearly, articulate why Atlassian should move there. We could articulate why now that stuff that [inaudible 01:04:35] struggled with before, and have enough data to validate all those claims. Explore was about exploring solutions, which doesn't mean build it and throw it out there and see what sticks. It's about if you get a bunch of customers raising a problem, can you get them to play back to the solution, [inaudible 01:04:53] address that problem?

(01:04:54):
And so in the case of Jira Product Discovery, because we were not building, we didn't need any new technology, it was mainly new UX and new workflows, we basically validated a lot of that with Figma in dozens of Zooms. But it's basically coming back saying, "Here's how those companies are framing it. Here's their problems, here's how this thing would be solving it for them."

(01:05:18):
So that's part of Explore, which is validating that it's worth investing in in terms of solution. We don't only have the right problem, we've got the right solutions. Then Make is about making it happen in stages, starting with an alpha, then a beta, and then going out there. And Impact is that stuff is actually ready to go [inaudible 01:05:37]. And now let's see the impact it has on Atlassian's business and keep monitoring it from there.

(01:05:42):
And it turns into a real business from that point onwards. But everyone at Atlassian knew these four stages, Wonder, Explore, Make, Impact. Whenever we were talking with teams, we were telling them we're currently in Explore. And we started doing that with the full bet itself. Then we started doing that to talk about the different features that we were working on or problem areas we were going after. Which means that now every time we go into conversation with other teams and we'll mention, "We're in Wonder," or, "We're in Explore," they know what to expect. When we go to someone in the leadership team and we say, "We want to go from Explore to Make," they know they're going to [inaudible 01:06:22] because they need developers now.

(01:06:23):
So all that vocabulary and clear expectations set for every stage of the process really helped us to facilitate all the conversations that we had with everyone in the organization. And really protected us again from all those, basically, teams that felt like they had to chime in. Now, we're in Explore, we don't have anything ready that's been validated. Let's not have opinions about how the architecture is done before we have validated that customers want something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:52):
This is super cool. I feel like we could do a whole podcast just on the structure of Point A and how you all do this. But just one question, what does the gate look like when you move from Explore to Make, Make to Impact? Is there a group of people that sit in a room and decide thumbs up, thumbs down? How does that decision work?

Tanguy Crusson (01:07:08):
So we basically write a six pager that looks at all the different aspects of all the questions that we're going to answer. And then we are in a meeting with the Point A stakeholders and the founders of Atlassian. And everyone reads that page for about 15 minutes and then question, answers, comments, and [inaudible 01:07:31] of that, by the end of this meeting, we know whether we are clear to go to the next stage.

(01:07:35):
We got booted back one time when we were like, "Hey, we're ready to go anywhere from alpha to beta as part of Make." And they're like, "No, you're not." And I was like, "No, we're not." And so we stayed and we basically got more time than what was initially allocated to us. But basically, the founders and the leadership of Point A as well as heads from the different lines of businesses at Atlassian were participating in those sessions, which-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
That is super cool.

Tanguy Crusson (01:08:02):
Basically, visibility all the way up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:05):
And they might also just decide, "Let's kill this thing, it's not working," at one of these meetings.

Tanguy Crusson (01:08:10):
So it might be, "Let's kill this thing," which happened to a number of bets that we did, or it might be, "Let's roll this thing into something else." So for example, our new whiteboards product. I say product, whiteboards feature part of Confluence initially came out of Point A. And was eventually rolled into Confluence instead because [inaudible 01:08:32] made more sense there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:33):
That's so interesting. So you said there's 100 projects that went through Point A. So there's this funnel. Is there a meeting for all 100 of these that the founders go to for all these incubations or did they come join later down the funnel?

Tanguy Crusson (01:08:46):
Not the full 100 of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:47):
Okay, good.

Tanguy Crusson (01:08:50):
And I'm saying 100, it's over a few different quarters of teams coming in and [inaudible 01:08:53], but not for the initial stage of entering Point A.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
I see.

Tanguy Crusson (01:08:58):
It's usually when they've been accepted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:01):
I interrupted you and took us on a tangent, you were sharing essentially the things that went well and how this all came together.

Tanguy Crusson (01:09:08):
So failure as the most likely outcome. It's the one thing I would stand behind in everything because I've seen before what happens when we get too complacent with it's going to work. Lessons from the previous things I was talking about. So this one really key. Second one, this one is much harder, which is if you're starting something like this, your teams will need to break a lot of rules that are established. But they need to be able to do that without breaking the trust of everyone in the organization.

(01:09:39):
The rules were created to support the business at the stage where it was successful, and it just so happens that they might not work for new bets. So the trick here for me has been to... The way I pictured it is, I've got a bunch of chips. Since I joined my class, I've been accumulating chips and those chips are-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):
Like social capital.

Tanguy Crusson (01:10:04):
Yeah. It's like trust I've built with the founders, with the different business leaders, with succeeding on stuff or failing and explaining why and trying to do better next time. And all that stuff gave me, like you said capital. I've got these chips and I decided on this bet, "You know what, I'm going to go all in." So I always said, "If it works, it works. If it doesn't work, I'm probably out of here, but I'm going to go all in."

(01:10:27):
So if I see something that's not going to work, I'm going to say it. We're not going to do it. And so I knew I was going to put myself in tough conversations because people are here to protect things that need to be protected. They just don't make sense for the stuff I was working on. So one example, breaking rules without breaking trust where it was tricky.

(01:10:48):
We have a lot of rules in a company like Atlassian, and this is how it works in engineering. I mean, engineers are the biggest part of our workforce. Basically, shit gets done because engineers work on it. And what I needed was to be able to hire the right team, only principal levels, people who have a lot of internal credits so that they can commit to any team's repo, no questions asked. People who are not looking for the next promotion, but they want to make a splash. And when that's not possible, I wanted to be able to hire contractors to fill in the gaps and stuff like that. And I was like, "A lot of the rules that I need to be able to break is basically in engineering." So I decided not to have an engineering leader in the team, and to do it myself.

(01:11:36):
So I was the product leader and the engineering leader. I was technical enough to be able to have these conversations, but mainly I was just working with amazing engineers who just could self-drive themselves. So they were able to make changes in areas that were not owned by them. They were able to do changes that do not respect any of our standards. They were able to hack their way around rebuilding services and whatnot. We are now not in the position where we need to do stuff like that, but at that time I needed to take a position like that so we could actually go and move fast with basically the equivalent of being a startup inside Atlassian.

(01:12:13):
That's not comfortable to do stuff like that. And I would not recommend that in many environments. Atlassian was very forgiving throughout the whole thing. It doesn't mean that I didn't [inaudible 01:12:27] on that.

(01:12:28):
That was not simple. For example, one of the rules is, at that time we didn't want to have a footprint in Europe back then for more engineering teams. It's different today, but back then it was like that. I was like, "Shit. I'm based in France, I'm trying to start this stuff. I don't want to move to the US or move back to Australia just for this right now." So I hired contractors, lots of contractors when we started, or not lots because we're not a big team, but contractors to build this stuff.

(01:12:57):
And again, contractors, they don't fall into the same rules as the rest of engineering staff. So basically, all the rules around you need to contribute to... For example, the engineering team could say, "[inaudible 01:13:10] to the next, leadership could say, "You need to invest 15% of your time in reliability."

(01:13:15):
And for us it's like, "We're not there yet. We don't even have a prototype out." Yeah. But that's the company rule, all right. Again, no engineering manager and contractors, boom, none of these rules applied. So it was people who were looking at it from the outside who were like, "Wow, dude, are you sure you're okay with all this?" And it felt super uncomfortable, but we have the support of leadership from it. It's just a tough transition for Atlassian from the, "We only invest in the big ones for acquisitions," to "Let's invest in [inaudible 01:13:46]."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:45):
This is a crazy story you're telling me. So you're leading this team, you hired a team of contractors to build this product. You're in a whole different country from the rest of Atlassian, basically. And the whole idea here was just to do stuff that wouldn't be necessarily allowed at Atlassian. They wouldn't let you work this way. And you found that to make the thing you needed to make, the thing that you were betting your career on, it sounded like, you're just going to be this pirate working on this thing in France and it worked out?

Tanguy Crusson (01:14:18):
So the Point A emoji and Atlassian is a [inaudible 01:14:24]. I was not the only one. There were quite a few of us working on new bets, basically operating like that. Each questioning different rules. The end goal was not to question the rules, the end goal was to get to the stuff that we needed to do, which is we just need to clean this space, to work with users to test prototypes up until it works and progressively get to, as I said, a product that's going to be enough to launch. So we never intended to break the rules, which is the things that we were going to choose the ones that were going to work to support us on this mission and say no to the others.

(01:14:58):
You mentioned Europe. At the time, a lot of other Point A founders were struggling with the fact that they were operating from their mothership in Sydney because they're still with everyone else. You were talking about doing all this stuff, but remember that we've got this OKR thing, we've got this vision for GR that we're building, you need to participate in all this. And so I was in Europe going, "Fine, schedule it at your time."

(01:15:28):
And I think a lot of teams were like, "We don't care enough about this test. They're telling us it's not going to exist in six months. I don't care enough about this to stay up late or wake up super early every day to disagree with them." And so there was a lot of the early success that we had in being able to move super fast that came from being so far, that people just did not engage to stop us.

(01:15:58):
And that's why we were initially the group with the fastest speed. Then it was possible to institutionalize those things into Point A to then make it possible to do it from within Atlassian. But at first, we just needed to blaze our way through. So that's what we did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:16):
So it sounds like one of the biggest lessons and things that work well for something like this is a super silo sort of team, as much as you can disconnect from the core business and let them just do what you think you need to do?

Tanguy Crusson (01:16:30):
You've interviewed Megan on the show before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):
Yeah.

Tanguy Crusson (01:16:33):
And I listened again to the way she pitched Point A, and yes, that's exactly what came out of what she was saying. Which is, we gave the space for those teams to be able to do this with a lot of autonomy. And that was the outcome of all that work, basically, which is the program was then set up so new teams could do it and fitting within the mothership, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
And I think people hear that, like yeah, okay, of course. [inaudible 01:16:59] incubations, silo, separate, they do their own thing. People hear and they try to do that, but I imagine it's not actually what they need to do. And what I'm hearing is you went to a pretty far extreme of making that happen, not basically breaking the rules to allow for a silo to actually exist. And I love that. What else was key to the success of making this work out?

Tanguy Crusson (01:17:22):
So the one that I'm most passionate about is how we work with customers is very different in a super early stage bet versus to what you do in a very established product like Jira. So the first part is, how can we innovate in a way that doesn't fuck up existing customers? Jira, 120,000 customers, Atlassian, 300,000 customers. We can't just go in there, start experimenting, breaking a whole bunch of shit that millions of people experience and go, "What are you doing, Atlassian?" So what we needed is to create this area where we could experiment that's away from Jira while being inside Jira.

(01:18:06):
That part was a bit tough. It's possible to do. In fact, I came across an article from Ben Weiss. No, sorry, Noah Weiss, it's from many years ago now. Where he was basically talking about innovating in a successful material product and talked about three stages of incubate, iterate, integrate. And as part of that he gave the examples of Instagram, Twitter, and Foursquare. Where basically he was explaining, at the beginning, for example, Instagram was a feed that was chronological. And then the team started to experiment with a popular tab that was on the side that was not integrated into the core of the product that everyone uses.

(01:18:47):
They iterated on that for a while. That became the explore tab and then the explore tab became the main feed. The feed is not chronological anymore, it's based on your interests. And that part really resonated with me where I was like, "You know what? We're going to try to apply that to Jira, which is we're going to build it in Jira, but we're going to extract ourselves from a lot of the core components of the core base to rebuild the UX that would work for the audience we're going after."

(01:19:17):
Our audience is product managers. They have no patience for spinners, things need to be visual. They need to be able to quickly move things around to visualize the potential options they've got on their roadmaps and stuff like that. It needs to be snappy, it needs to get out of the way, but also something that they can feel proud to present to their stakeholders to have discussions around that.

(01:19:39):
It can be bogged down into the details. It can go to very, very deep [inaudible 01:19:43]. It needs to be an area, a space where you feel like you can breathe and have creative conversations. And Jira's UI was not exactly known for that. And in fact, most of the product managers I talked to were like, "I don't want to do this in Jira. It's too strict, there's too many workflows, it's owned by IT," yada, yada. And so we said, "That's fine. We're going to experiment with an experience that's going to be detached from Jira still on the same platform."

(01:20:09):
And that's what we did, basically. And so this concept of incubate by working on something on the site, iterate until you've got it right and then integrate it back into the main product is something I would definitely do again. We're currently in the middle of the integration phase for Jira product discovery.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):
So the lesson there is don't force yourself to be a part of the broader product, initially. First, figure out what it could be if it's its own thing, and then eventually you can integrate?

Tanguy Crusson (01:20:40):
It depends who you're doing it for and the programs that they've got. Don't feel limited by your platform to answer the core things that are necessary for your product to work, basically. So if the platform is good enough for us, if the UX was good enough for the product managers, we would not have done that. And we would've had a hard time justifying it, but because it was not, we basically gave ourselves the stamp to be able to do it. So still in don't fuck existing customers, something I read from a site, from Reforge that talk about the Safety Funnel.

(01:21:16):
So they have this thing where the typical growth funnel goes from acquisition all the way to revenue and there's a whole bunch of different stages in between. Your goal is to maximize the number of people who go through this funnel successfully.

(01:21:29):
And I was trying to explain to people what we were trying to do with Jira Product Discovery, and I was struggling to put a name on it. And it was we're going to work with a few, small number of customers up until it's right for them and then we're going to expose it to progressively more people. And I know it's very common sense, but that's basically what we decided to do instead of the Atlassian way, which was more, "Hey, we measure our success based on..." For example, at that time, I think it was still before all those projects, "... monthly active users." If that was a measure of success, we would've been pushed very quickly to go and expose it to as many people as we could. We didn't want to do that because if they would have a bad experience, it would've been very hard to claim them back afterwards.

(01:22:11):
So someone in Reforge put the name on Safety Funnel. So the Safety Funnel is amazing. People don't understand that. You basically put a hard stop and you limit the number of people who had bad experiences. And you do that for a while, up until you can prove it's amazing and then you invite more people. So we did a lot of that. So we basically created that pocket away from Jira to reimagine what Jira could be for product managers. And we only exposed that to a very small number of customers at first. So that's don't fuck existing customers' first principle.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:45):
And the reason that's important, just to put a point there, is the business will start to get upset if you're making many customers upset.

Tanguy Crusson (01:22:53):
That would've been it if we had triggered an incident that brought down Jira for millions of users. And first time might have been okay. I mean, by the third time we would've been asked to pack up and go home, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:05):
Got it. So the advice there is just limit how many people get exposed to your very early product, even if it's going to hurt your numbers. You don't want to cause people to be like, "What the hell are you doing over there, man? [inaudible 01:23:17]."

Tanguy Crusson (01:23:16):
So [inaudible 01:23:17] your numbers is now the interesting one. So how do you frame success and how do you define metrics when your goal is basically to work with a small number of customers for a super long time? So that's what I ended up defining for this, is based on a term that was used at Atlassian that I tried to formalize it into something that everyone could refer to, which is the Lighthouse Users Program. And so the principle for it is it's a program, so it's an official thing. We have hundreds of thousands of customers at Atlassian, but we would only build the experience for a small number of them. And so there are stages to it.

(01:23:56):
The first stage is we work with 10 and we prove that the problems that they had are the things that we solved and where we spend most of the time for the first 10 Lighthouse Users is to explain why they are the Lighthouse Users.

(01:24:13):
Everything that explains why we believe they are a proxy for every customer that we serve afterwards. We then have this stage from 10 to 100 where we recruit more customers, but we're still not in the fully self-service, don't need a lot of onboarding stuff. We're still testing out the value, but we're testing the different variations in the scenarios that people face to make sure that the core solution that we've got can cater for those. So there's a lot of different options and different security needs. There's a lot of subtleties that you catch between 10 and 100.

(01:24:44):
Then we get to a stage where we're like, "You know what? It's good. It solves people's problems, but it's not self-service. We just need to explain stuff. We need to work with people on Slack. We need to work with them and answer a lot of support tickets or do a lot of Zoom calls to explain stuff."

(01:24:58):
Now we need to get from 100 to 1,000, and by getting there we basically need to solve all of that and after that we graduate. So basically by detailing that and explaining all the success criteria in between, it helps to define success in that in the make phase, we've got 10, 100, 1,000, and then people can understand exactly where we're at there, and the types of questions we're trying to answer. In the 10, we're answering every question with a user, snippet of a video call with them, either talking about their problem and solution but showing the product and how they solve with it.

(01:25:34):
That's how we wanted our stakeholders to view it, which is it's very qualitative, but have it felt from the user's perspective. It's different when we go from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1,000, but for each of those there's a playbook for how you go from one to the other. That helped us because we could then clean the space to do the right thing and we will not ask to hit, for example, a multi-active user's number or number of customers' number or percentage of users who use this number. Because it's very qualitative still when we're at that stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:09):
That is super cool and super interesting. And it's along the lines of the gates. It aligns with, at each gate, here's how many users we're looking for. Basically, it sets expectations for what success is, keeps you from having to scale things too early. It's such a cool idea. And you call it Lighthouse Users, like the Lighthouse Users Program?

Tanguy Crusson (01:26:25):
Lighthouse Users, and there's two sides to it. We just talked about the stakeholder facing side. The one I love is the team facing side of this, which is I've seen a lot of teams, Atlassian and other companies as the products grow, you tend to leverage a lot more user research, formal user research or CSAT service. And the way I call it, it's hiding behind research and not being close enough to the ground with customers. And what I want to do in the teams I work with is to create a direct feedback loop with customers, but not like someone gives you feedback and you do it. We talk...

Tanguy Crusson (01:27:00):
... with customers, but not like someone gives you feedback and you do it. We talk to those customers, we build stuff for them. So there's something I've seen which is climate change. It's a thing. Everyone knows it's a thing. We all read reports about it. We're all like ... Every time we read an IPCC report we're like, "Shit." Do we change anything? Not enough.

(01:27:23):
What makes people want to change and actually gives them a trigger to change? I've seen is a lot more empathizing with individual people's experience. If I know someone that's impacted by climate change, it's going to make me relate a lot more strongly to the concept of climate change and want to change myself. Sorry for the power note here. I'm-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
No, that's such a good example. Such a good way of making that point very clear of just the power of talking to a small number of users versus thinking that the more data you have, looking at data, CSAT scores, NPS retention will tell you what you need.

Tanguy Crusson (01:28:02):
So what we do with that is we recruit 10 people and we put these people in front of the whole team, not just the PMs, PM, designer, engineering. We meet on Zoom, we chat, we work with the same ones over months to build a product. They are with us on Slack. We have regular things.

(01:28:20):
What we've seen, what I've seen going fast is that the engineers would go into a planning meeting and the PM would say, "So we should work on X," and the engineer will go, "Wait a minute. We've had a talk with this customer and they struggle with this so I think we should work on that instead and fix that part of the experience," and so on and so forth.

(01:28:35):
So all of a sudden you're not talking about a product manager, you're talking about a product team with product engineers. So there was this thing at Atlassian where we called some engineers were more like system engineers, some were more product engineers.

(01:28:49):
In my opinion everyone can be a product engineer. They just need to be exposed to the right user context. The right user context, what is it? It's 10 customers you know by name, you know their context, you know their problems. You can empathize with it. This empathy makes you want to act to change your product to solve their problem and you get really huge pride coming back out of it. 

(01:29:11):
It can seem counterintuitive in a company like Atlassian. 300,000 customers, right? We should build for them. Well, you can't, right? We're limited in our ability to make changes that will work for the vast majority so might as well embrace that. Embrace that we are indeed biased, that we are indeed reacting based on feelings, like wanting to help or not wanting to help or reacting strongly to what you've seen, but we are embracing that to try and build the best product possible. I've actually seen that the outcome is, so far on this product it's worked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:51):
If you actually think about this from the perspective of how would a startup approach this? This is exactly how a company that's just starting out would approach it. So it makes tons of sense to think of it this way. It's just people don't actually do this. It's hard to do.

(01:30:04):
This is a segue to a question I wanted to ask. So it took probably a long time for you to show real success, real progress, real like, "This is going to work." First of all how long was that period of just like, "This is probably not going to work too. Oh wow, maybe this is going to work"? And along the same lines, how does Atlassian slash ... What have you learned about how to protect this, Pixar people call it an ugly baby? When an idea is new they call this an ugly baby. People don't want it. It's just like, "Get rid of this thing."

(01:30:36):
Man, that sounds mean to say, but that's the way they talk about it. That's the term in creativity.

Tanguy Crusson (01:30:44):
That's a good one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:46):
How do you protect that because that's the biggest challenge I think a lot of companies have is just like, "It's been six months. No one wants this. We're going to kill it." How do you protect it? So how long did it take for it to show success and what have you learned about how to protect?

Tanguy Crusson (01:30:58):
Yeah. So basically, internal comms is everything there. The way I saw my job as, a large part as being very clear on where we were, on what we were learning on, how fast we were learning, how fast we were moving. Being super honest every step of the way, not try to make shit up and try to make it bigger than it is, more successful than it is.

(01:31:18):
On the contrary, be very clear about what we're testing, where we're testing it. Doing that with data, doing that with personal customer stories because we all can constantly relate to the heart and to the mind. So that's what I always try to weave into comms that I then send weekly.

(01:31:36):
So we've got this product internally called Atlas, which have a project on Atlas. People can subscribe to this project and then weekly you send a tweet-sized update about your project. I was using that as a platform to communicate internally about this product and there were actually hundreds of people who ended up subscribing to this thing.

(01:31:54):
Every week when we were at the stage where we were trying to get the first version out to customers it was a weekly demo of the product and everything that we built. Show the momentum as much as possible. I was even saving features for one week to the next just to ... When I knew we were going to be on vacation, for example, just to have something to show this train that keeps moving, it keeps moving. You don't want to get in front of it.

(01:32:17):
But then what I needed to do is to balance that out with all the customer side of things. So when we started to put it in front of customers then it was snippets from customer conversations. No one is going to read a research report that takes 30 minutes to read. Everyone is happy to watch a three-minute snippet with four customers talking about something. So I was using that a lot every week by posting those out there and then sharing them widely on Slack to go, "This is what we learned. This is what this customer is facing in terms of problem with Jira. This is how we're solving it. This is them talking about it," that kind of stuff.

(01:32:48):
So I was publishing that there and then sending that everywhere on Slack. Those kinds of things are what give people a sense of velocity and speed, and no one wants to fuck with a high-speed train. You don't get in front of it. That doesn't help and you're going to look bad by doing that. So basically that ended up buying us the time that we needed to get out of this, I don't know how you call it, the ugly baby phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:13):
An ugly baby phase.

Tanguy Crusson (01:33:16):
So basically it helped us get out of this phase where we don't have anything to show for yet because what we're showing is based on the learnings we're trying to get and we're trying to do that with, "Here's some numbers, here's some demos, here's some user snippets." Doing that every week because people can consume bite-sized content every week. They just struggle with the stuff where you come in three, four months later and go, "This is what we have to show for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:43):
Right. How long was that period before it got out of this ugly baby phase for you? When did people start to get like, "Oh wow, this might work"?

Tanguy Crusson (01:33:49):
Honestly, we had something dogfooding within two months, in the hands of the first lighthouse user within five months. We iterated on the alpha for maybe six months. We then entered a beta that lasted close to a year.

(01:34:06):
So I think at every step of the way people could see us going somewhere, and I think initially they judged, not the outcome. They judged the team a lot more than the outcome.

(01:34:22):
So there's all this talk of founder market fit and I think really that's what you need to be teasing out, which is, is it the right thing, going after the right problems? Then if they can answer yes in ways that you haven't thought about asking consistently week over week, it's enough. I think that's where we were up until the stage where we were able to give something to customers, but the first lighthouse user was five months in. So it didn't even matter whether it looked good or not because people could see, "Okay, that's what ... Oh, there's something there," right?

(01:34:51):
So I'm not sure if there's one precise moment where it happened. However, there was this one moment where we were like, "Okay, that's it. We're ready to go GA." One of the founders, Mike went, "No, you're not. That thing is ugly. I do not want to look at it. It needs to level up with the rest of the Atlassian design standards. Our customers have expectations from us on that front. Your stuff is functional, but it's way too early."

(01:35:19):
So we went and fixed it. Took us two, three months and then we were okay to go. But yeah, no, because we had point A, because we had this expectation set that it would take a while to get there and because we were able to show progress every week, we basically didn't really feel that moment where we don't know what to do with this because it's too early.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:42):
This design improvement phase, what I'm visualizing is you're this pirate that is invited to a nice dinner and you have to start cleaning up. You have to start looking good and become inter-society. It makes a lot of sense. 

(01:35:54):
Also, what you're describing makes me think again of this concept of, it's your job to keep the flame alive and help it spread within the organization. So you have this idea and you're just like, keep momentum going, keep the flame growing by sharing constant updates, sharing progress, make it very easy to consume with little snippets and videos. So there's a lot of great advice here.

(01:36:13):
So timeline-wise, interestingly what I'm hearing is it basically took a year from idea to alpha, something like that. Is that roughly right?

Tanguy Crusson (01:36:21):
Just like seven months ... No, five months to first alpha1 customer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:26):
Okay.

Tanguy Crusson (01:36:27):
We stayed in alpha for six months.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:30):
Okay, got it. So through alpha about a year total. Many people are hearing this. On the one hand it would be like, "Of course, Atlassian has all these resources. They're going to spend a year on this idea that who knows is going to work out. It's so easy for them."

(01:36:43):
I imagine there was much pain and suffering and challenge along the way that happened that makes it not so easy. Is there something you could share by just the struggle to actually make this real just as a way to wrap up conversation, go back to therapy if there's anything you want to share?

Tanguy Crusson (01:36:58):
Yeah. Basically, it's pretty much what we talked about earlier with lots of processes that were not changed yet because we're at the very beginning of point A, and people still wanting us to chime in on the things that were important for their part of the organization where we would play a part later if we become successful.

(01:37:19):
So none of that stuff was just solved once and for all. It was just a constant process to play with that, but I think we managed to get out of these things pretty gracefully in the end and I think we gained some level of admiration for some teams from that and some found it a bit ... It's always interesting to see someone breaking the rules and getting away with it. I think it inspired some of the other founders to try and do that, which was pretty cool to see.

(01:37:46):
It's actually something I'd love to see more, hearing back from the customers I've been talking to about this in their company, rather than feel suffocated by the current processes and they don't feel like they can break the chains. So I'm hoping it inspires a few more teams to give it a go, really.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:09):
There's clearly more I want to learn about point A and how other companies do this incubation stuff. So this is a really good inspiration to dig deeper into those sorts of programs.

(01:38:18):
We've covered a lot of ground. We've talked about things that have worked and haven't worked, all kinds of therapy and pain, but also things that help you succeed and build amazing products. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Tanguy Crusson (01:38:32):
Yeah. I would try to balance the point I just gave, which is it's hard so someone has to try. Always feel like you can push. I'd like to balance that a bit with be careful for yourself as well and make sure that you're doing this in an environment that's ready to welcome it.

(01:38:54):
So as I mentioned, I worked at Atlassian now for the past 10 years. Before that I used to work in banks, in heavily regulated industries, in a whole bunch of different areas where that kind of stuff was not okay. I could have tried to push, it would have not gone well at all. 

(01:39:15):
So I think I'm deeply convinced by the fact that we don't need so much top-down leadership. What we need is a lot of autonomous leaders, regardless of their position within the org, able to push for change, fighting for the right things, but you need to do that in an environment that's safe for you to do so. If it's not, I think it's okay to consider alternatives.

(01:39:37):
So in other words, don't feel like you're trapped. Right? You only have one work life. Do it in places where you really believe you can do amazing work and surrounded by people that you're excited to work with. Otherwise, I've been there before where it's possible to become cynical by the weight of the things that are not possible and ending up doubting your own ability to do stuff really. So it's a bit of a balance of push for the right things, but also watch after yourself and if the environment is not right, it's okay to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:09):
This is a really hot topic and common question in product management and I imagine other functions in product of just how much can actually change as an IC at a company. I hear all this advice about making change, changing culture, incubating stuff, innovating. How much can you actually make an impact versus, "Nothing's going to change. I should go work somewhere else"? Do you have any advice there? It sounds like basically you're saying there's oftentimes you have no impact on how the business and culture's going to work and you probably should go find a company like Atlassian that does learn how to incubate and innovate and think differently.

Tanguy Crusson (01:40:44):
Yeah. This one is a ... I'm not sure how to answer that really because I've worked with, consulted, worked for close to 50 companies. Atlassian is the first company I joined where I was at home from day one, challenged in the right way, but fuck, I can really choose my battles and go after them. Things are hard, but it's okay.

(01:41:09):
So I joined Atlassian. [inaudible 01:41:13] found the trampoline like that, but yeah, I would just go, not settle for status quo because you cannot be the only sane person in a room. At some point you will go insane. The environment will permeate on you. You are not this entity that is absolutely permeable to everything that happens around you. Everything around you will affect you and will change you as a person. I really believe that.

(01:41:36):
So you need to surround yourself with people and environments that can help bring out the best in you, otherwise you can turn bad. I myself have been cynical in the past working in environments that were cynical and I then decided it's not me. I do not want it to be me. It was me back then. I do not want it to be me.

(01:41:55):
So yeah, that's my only advice, which is have the courage to ask yourselves those questions because otherwise it might change you in ways you don't want to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:07):
Amazing advice. Really important advice. With that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tanguy Crusson (01:42:15):
I am, looking forward to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:17):
All right, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Tanguy Crusson (01:42:23):
Yeah, the first one was a book that was recommended to me by Scott Farquhar, founder of Atlassian co-founder. Who: A Method for Hiring is basically a book about how to do the thing that I for a while was really bad at, which is try to interview to understand who's going to be a good person, not a good person to join your team.

(01:42:44):
Second one, so that's one book about work. Two other books that are not about work. Highly recommend reading Hakim's Odyssey. It's the story of a Syrian refugee moving out of Syria, trying to move into Europe. We hear a lot of these stats and numbers about people trying to cross the Med Sea or basically become refugees in other countries and it's very easy to look at it complacently up until you meet a personal story. This personal story of Hakim that was told very beautifully by this illustrator is well worth a read on that front.

(01:43:19):
The last one is a book that I'm not sure has been translated from French. It's called Vivre avec la Terre, To Live with the Earth and it's about how we could build a different agricultural system to the one that we have today that might have better ways to feed us into the future that doesn't require large monoculture of vegetables that may not be as sustainable.

(01:43:47):
They managed to create a really efficient structure on very small parcels of land with a lot of species working together to control and not need the use of any pesticides and stuff like that. They've been always surrounded by teams of researchers from the, I think it's called the Inria. It's one of the French research centers, have got really amazing results, but I don't think many know that this stuff exists and that it could actually be used out there and I think that's a shame.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:14):
I think it's the first book that sounds recommended that's only in a different language, but may not be translated.

Tanguy Crusson (01:44:20):
It might be translated. I hope it is. It's pretty thick though and it's very technical. So I've read the principles bit and I would get lost in all the technical aspects of growing food, to be honest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:26):
Okay, love it. So let's ask you your favorite interview question. What's your favorite interview question?

Tanguy Crusson (01:44:32):
Yeah. So I struggled a lot with interviewing and I've read all the standard interview questions there is out there and I've heard them in your podcast as well. There is one that came from this book that Scott Farquhar also told me was working really well for him is when people describe an experience, you ask them the name of the person that they worked with back then. And you ask them, "So when I call this person after our call, what do you think they're going to say about that?"

(01:45:02):
Apparently this does something and I've seen it happen where people are unable to project and invent on the spot something from the lens of another person talking about them. So they might be able to talk about, "I did this, I did that, I did that. So when I talk ... "Who was your boss? My boss was ... So when I ask this person, what do you think they're going to say?" It's like, "Ah, well actually, I was only leading a part of it and maybe you shouldn't call them because XYZ."

(01:45:33):
That part makes people all of a sudden go out of this scripted version they give of themselves and become more real for a second. You get a bit of the authenticity coming out, which often is very hard to get to for me in interview questions. I've seen it happen. I find that very funny to do now because people get really uneasy for a second and then you get to something real.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:57):
That is genius. Makes so much sense. Makes me wonder how I can integrate this tip into my podcast interviews. Really good tip. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Tanguy Crusson (01:46:08):
Yeah, it's got nothing with tech, nothing to do with tech. I'm kite surfing a lot at the moment and I came across hydrofoils, which is basically these things where there's an airplane underneath you on a mast which is connected to a board. You're on the board with your kite and you basically just fly over the water.

(01:46:32):
That invention is just brilliant. It's relatively easy to learn and I can spend basically, parts of my weekend flying over water in as much as a breeze of wind because there's absolutely zero friction between the board and the water. So that's, technically speaking I think is genius the way they created that and inspiring themselves from airplanes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):
Is that the thing that Zuck was riding with his sunscreen with the flag or is that something else? I don't know if you saw that photo. Don't worry about it.

Tanguy Crusson (01:47:00):
No, I didn't see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:01):
I like that you say it's relatively easy to learn even though there's a kite on you pulling you in the water on this thing that's above the water. I don't know if I believe you.

Tanguy Crusson (01:47:11):
Yeah. I mean, there's sports and crafts that are difficult to learn. This one you can get comfortable in 18 months to two years, which is really, really short. It could be a sport that you would have done before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:24):
Just a couple of years. Okay. I like your bar for ... I'm going to ask a question along these lines, but before we get there, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life, maybe share with friends and family?

Tanguy Crusson (01:47:37):
I've got two, one for work and one for everything in life. The one for work is initially a quote from Obama. I can't remember the exact quote. I'm going to paraphrase, but let's keep it about the work. So there's going to be moments in your career where you don't feel valued and you wonder, "Am I doing the right thing? Am I being recognized? Am I valued? Am I at the right place?" Whenever that happens, a lot of parasitic thoughts may come in. You may face imposter syndrome and stuff like that. Happens to me super regularly. 

(01:48:09):
Whenever that happens, what I do is I remind myself, "Keep it about the work," because as long as you make it about the work there's always work to be done and there's always a path that emerges from that work. It's a bit of the same of this, you've got this thing in yoga where once you're committed good things will happen. Well, that's exactly what I've seen and that's helped me every time. I reread this quote whenever I'm in these moments of turmoil around me.

(01:48:37):
Now when I face those moments I also remind myself of the other one, which I invented, but I don't think I'm the only one who has invented that one, which is, "Remember that in 100 years we'll all be dead and forgotten. So don't take yourself too seriously. You're not that important. You're probably not that important, as important as you think for the people that you are arguing with."

(01:49:01):
That's also the beauty in all things, which is it has an end. In the end it probably doesn't matter so might as well give it your best shot. That's what the existentialists back in France many generations ago were talking about. This point is close to Albert Camus' thesis, right? "If it doesn't make sense might as well go for it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:24):
Really good points, really good lessons, really good mottos. Final question, you were ranked number four worldwide in a form of free diving. First of all, can you briefly describe what is free diving and then can you share one thing that might surprise someone about the sport and the skill?

Tanguy Crusson (01:49:43):
Yeah. So yes, that's my claim to fame. I was ranked number four in basically, the distance you can swim in a swimming pool without fins with 167 meters, which is 550 feet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:57):
And underwater?

Tanguy Crusson (01:49:59):
Underwater breaststroke. I went further with the monofin, the thing you see back there, but breaststroke was one meter away from the French record and ranking number four worldwide that year. The one I'm most proud of is I actually went to 300 feet underwater deep, came back in one piece and I really enjoyed the whole thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:20):
300 feet. That's like-

Tanguy Crusson (01:50:23):
92 meters.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:25):
Oh, geez. I'm trying to imagine what that is like compared to a Statue of Liberty or something like that, but I'll look that up later.

Tanguy Crusson (01:50:38):
I look at buildings one. Buildings can be as little as 20, 30 meters and can go super higher, but 90 meters is pretty high, yeah. Last time I looked at a building like that, I can't remember which one it was, but it's pretty high. So it's take one breath, go down, touch the bottom plate on the rope and then come back up.

(01:50:54):
One thing that may surprise people with this is that everyone is much more gifted at it than they think. So I used to give courses on the weekend for free diving and most people when I ask them, "Hey, how long do you think you can be underwater?" And they tell me something like 30 seconds, maybe a minute. "How deep you think can you go? Ah, maybe five meters."

(01:51:15):
At the end of the weekend most people were able to hold their breath for two to three minutes and to go to 20 meters deep. So it's one of those things where it looks absolutely impressive and crazy and amazing and in fact we're naturally gifted to it. There's a lot of physiological changes that happen when we dive that make it possible, but I think it's fascinating how little we know about our bodies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:51:38):
I'm looking up what is 300 feet compared to real-life objects on perplexity. So what is 300 feet compared to real-life objects? Here we go, 300 feet. The length of a football field. Okay, yeah. I should have realized that. Close to the length of a Boeing 737.

Tanguy Crusson (01:52:00):
Yeah. You need to look at it this way to get some perspective. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:01):
Yeah, and a football field-

Tanguy Crusson (01:52:01):
You go underwater in that-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:10):
... Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. But I love your advice that people can do much better at the skill than they think.

Tanguy Crusson (01:52:14):
Yeah. Everyone from kids to adults are really amazing at it actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:20):
Tanguy, we've covered so much ground. I think this is going to help a lot of people that are trying to get better at free diving, but also at building zero to one within large companies. I am so thankful that you made time for this and that you shared some into this real talk and as you called it, therapy.

(01:52:37):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tanguy Crusson (01:52:44):
Yeah, so you can find me on LinkedIn if you know how to ... You don't need to know how to pronounce my name. You just need to know how to write it. I'm not super active on social media to be honest. I'm very much in the trenches building this product so I don't do much in terms of networking to be fair, but if you are using this product for example, and you have ideas for how we can improve it for you or you'd like to share some stories about how that's helped you or how it's not helping you, I'd love to connect because I spend a large part of my days talking to users, responding to support tickets and stuff like that. So, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:20):
Amazing. Tanguy, thank you so much for being here.

Tanguy Crusson (01:53:24):
Thank you, Lenny. Honestly, it's been amazing and I hope some of my gibberish is useful to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:31):
Definitely not gibberish. I think it's going to help a lot of people. With that, I'll let you go. Bye, everyone.

Tanguy Crusson (01:53:37):
Bye-bye.

# Inside Etsy’s product, growth, and marketplace evolution | Tim Holley (VP of Product)

## Transcript

Tim Holley (00:00:00):
When the CDC mandated face masks in early April 2020, that's when essentially we went to sleep one day with our typical April traffic, typical April sales, and then it was Black Friday overnight. And in part, because nobody knew where to find face masks. Our sellers are incredibly astute business people. And if you had been making wedding dresses, and you know how to sew, and you've got material, and you've got a bit of time, making a mask is quite a simple task. And so we just saw this huge surge of demand, and then supply rising to meet it. 
(00:00:37):
And we did something that as far as I know, we've never done in Etsy's past, which is we put out a call to our sellers to say, "Now's the time. Now's the time to make face masks if you can." And so it felt like this is our time to shine, to really help sellers continue to make sales, to help buyers find this critical item that they were looking for. 
(00:00:57):
And then from there, things kept going, and we really worked hard to make sure that the story was not just about face masks for our buyers, that they understood that Etsy's a place for so many different categories and so many different items.
Lenny (00:01:12):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences, building and growing today's most successful products. 
(00:01:20):
Today my guest is Tim Holley. Tim is VP of product at Etsy, where he's been for over 10 years, and has helped grow Etsy from around 500 million in GMV to over 13 billion in GMV. This episode is for anyone working on marketplace, or looking for ideas to increase growth, or looking for advice on how to change your internal culture. We get into the big cultural transition that Etsy went through that took them to the next level. Lots of examples of product changes that helped them with conversion, acquisition, and retention. Plus how Etsy organizes their teams, thinks about supply versus demand dynamics, how Etsy got started with growing their initial supply, and also their initial demand. Plus a bunch of frameworks and hiring advice, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Tim Holley after a short word from our sponsors.
(00:02:07):
This episode is brought to you by productroadmap.ai and Ignition. Productroadmap.ai is the first AI roadmapping suite. It helps ensure roadmaps drive revenue, by instantly aligning product with your sales and marketing teams to capture upsell opportunities.
(00:02:23):
Built by early leaders from [inaudible 00:02:26] and Craft, it automatically identifies feature gaps from your CRM data and your customer conversations, adds them to shareable roadmaps, easily prioritized by revenue impact, and then seamlessly closes the loop with sales reps via targeted notifications when feature gaps are closed.
(00:02:41):
As part of Ignition's broader go-to-market operating system, productroadmap.ai can also help create better handoffs and collaboration with product marketing teams, by giving both teams the tools to research, plan, orchestrate, and measure the process of building products and going to market. Packed with integrations, AI automation, and communication tools, it's truly a one-stop shop for product and marketing to bring things from concept to launch. To sign up, go to productroadmap.ai, and use promo code Lenny to get 75% off your first year.
(00:03:14):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.
(00:03:28):
Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.
(00:03:41):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.
(00:04:24):
Tim, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.
Tim Holley (00:04:28):
Thank you for having me on, Lenny, really appreciate it. Looking forward to it.
Lenny (00:04:30):
I'm looking forward to it even more. So you've been at Etsy for I think over 10 years, although I did notice that you left for a year and ended up leading product at SoulCycle. So first of all, what is that about? What happened there?
Tim Holley (00:04:43):
Yeah, at the time, I'd been at Etsy for over six years, and I just had the itch. I wanted to go work on a different product, build different things, experience different industry. Along, had a theory that working on the proactive side of healthcare, meaning fitness and wellness, is how you achieve better outcomes. And it felt like SoulCycle was a really interesting way to do that. Pretty well-known brand, high street presence in many cities. Could you affect change through that? 
(00:05:12):
Ultimately realized it wasn't a place that I wanted to spend a ton of time and energy. And so through a lot of soul-searching, grown, I know I found my way back to Etsy, really anchoring on three things. One, working on a product that you care about that adds value to other people's lives. And so what we do every day at Etsy is we help our sellers make sales, and that's really meaningful for the vast majority of them. It's reaching an audience that they wouldn't be able to reach. And so that feels like a really great thing to get up every morning and work on. 
(00:05:46):
And so that's maybe the business and the product side, and the other side is people. It might sound a little twee, but just working with people who you can learn from and who you respect, and ultimately can have fun working with, it matters a ton. We spend a lot of time of our days and our lives at work, and so doing it with people who you really value, it's awesome. 
(00:06:05):
I have one memory that we used to have an engineer who used to be a standup comedian, and so that really pushed the boundaries of what a standup meant every day. And it was always a little fun, a little exciting. You never quite knew what you were going to get. And so just little things like that, they make the work life really, really great.
Lenny (00:06:25):
That's hilarious. I never thought it that way. I feel like every standup needs a standup comedian in their standup. Sounds like that should be part of agile. We should need to change the manifesto. 
(00:06:35):
So I've always seen the Etsy journey from the outside, and so there's a few things that I've always wanted to dig into. One is I just remember this New York Times story back in the day when your current CEO Josh Silverman joined, and it felt like a huge moment in the history of Etsy, where it feels like it just kind of transitioned from this touchy feely, everyone loves each other moment to just like, "Hey guys, we got to build a real business here that's sustainable." And it feels like many startups have to go through that transition where it's like, "Nothing's ever going to change. It's going to be so we're all family here," to just, "Things have to change. This isn't working." I'm curious what that was like living through that. 
Tim Holley (00:07:15):
Yeah, I mean the first thing I'll say is it was a hard transition, and I was personally fortunate in the sense that the transition you're speaking of in 2017 also happened to coincide with rounds of layoffs. And I was super fortunate that I didn't lose my job, so I don't want to presuppose that my version of hard is the same as another person's version of hard.
(00:07:38):
But I think a lot of us, and myself included, we had a lot of our identity tied up in Etsy and what we're doing, a really deep passion for the mission of the business and what we're trying to achieve. I just mentioned helping small independent sellers. And just to be clear, that hasn't gone away. I think that that's something we've been really successful at pulling through as a line that was true 10 years ago and is still true today. But it was a time when we were really forced to rethink a lot of how we worked and what we worked on. 
(00:08:12):
Just to use a small example, we had had a pretty entrenched consensus-based culture, where we would really debate a lot of decisions and a lot of features. And on the one hand, I think that that does lead to good outcomes, right? Thoughtful products that have a lot of viewpoints really baked into the core of the thinking. 
(00:08:33):
On the other hand, not fast. When you have your identity tied up in the company and what you do, and then you're kind of being asked or you realize that you need to change how you're working, it can feel pretty existential. It's really cutting to the core of who you are and things that you hold really true. 
(00:08:53):
The reality is it's a business, and we needed to get faster at launching features, improving the experience, and ultimately, having a predictable way to drive GMS, gross merchandise sales, which is our north star KPI. And so it definitely took some time to work through that, but we got to a good place, and the results over the last few years to some degree speak for themselves. But it was a testing and trying time for sure.
Lenny (00:09:20):
I'm always curious how these changes play out and what works in making change. Is there something that you remember that Josh did well or that leaders did well to help that transition? 
Tim Holley (00:09:29):
One thing that is just such a standout is having... And I mentioned GMS as our north star KPI, just having that, being absolutely front and center, being the drumbeat that we talk about in every meeting, the measuring stick that we measure the success of launches against. And maybe it's a bit surprising, but we didn't have that type of clarity in the past.
(00:09:51):
And so rallying everyone around that. And you might not pay into it directly. You might pay into it through one or two levels of abstraction, but you're still clearly aligned with what the company's trying to achieve. And that was something that was a really stark difference, and I think that helped.
(00:10:09):
It helped the prioritization discussion a lot. If you can't really articulate why this thing matters to driving GMS and the type of timeframe that we're talking about, be it a quarter or 12 months out, and different projects will contribute in different ways. But that was just one huge standout, and that's been a drumbeat over the years that let's continue to stay focused on that as a metric. 
(00:10:32):
The other thing to me is bringing an outside in perspective, really benchmarking against your competitors and your competitive set. Don't get me wrong, I think Etsy is a unique marketplace. Our sellers are independent sellers. They sell unique items. The reality though is that our buyers are shopping all over the internet. They're shopping on High Street, they're shopping in different places. And so we have to be aware of the broader context of where they're spending their dollars helps us make better decisions over time.
(00:11:04):
And so on the one hand, there is no one-to-one direct competitor to Etsy. But there are other businesses and other brands that are competing for eyeballs or wallets that we need to be aware of. And bringing that into the discussion was a really helpful one that helped ground us in the overall dynamics of what buyers are doing,, where they're spending their money, and how they think about us.
Lenny (00:11:28):
Is there anything else you took away as a leader from watching that shift, that you bring to making change, transitioning people to working in a different way?
Tim Holley (00:11:36):
Definitely focus on a clear KPI that the teams can rally around. That's one. The other is... And I respect Josh immensely on his ability to tell a really clear narrative and use that consistently over time. The old adage of you need to say something three times before people understand it. I would wager you need to say it another three times before they internalize it.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And having that be part of the day-to-day conversation, it seems like such a small thing, but it adds up to having clarity on goal, the KPI point, and then clarity on why, the narrative point. If you can marry those two things, I think that's an incredibly powerful combination.
Lenny (00:12:15):
While we're on this topic, I'm curious what Etsy's values are. I imagine you've codified a few, we call them core values at are Airbnbs or something like that at Etsy. And if so, I'm curious what they are.
Tim Holley (00:12:26):
We call them guiding principles at Etsy. We have a few of them, and I won't go through all of them, but just to give you a flavor, one of them is around digging deeper, and that really speaks to aiming to really understand the why behind a change, to really push on the insights that we're learning through qual or quant research, or other inputs that we might be looking at in order to make the best decision possible with the information we have at the time. 
(00:12:52):
Another example of a principle is minimizing waste. It aligns with how we think about product development, which is, we want to know, is the work we're doing adding value to the customer and the business? And so something that isn't working out a lot of times in product development we're wrong. And so being able to say, "No, this is no longer valuable, we need to move on to the next thing," has been something that's served us really well.
(00:13:17):
Ultimately, we are quite a small team. There's just over 2,000 people in the business, and if you then scale back to engineering and product, we're not big. And so we have to be really diligent about how we're investing our time and our resources in order to be successful.
Lenny (00:13:31):
Awesome. Okay, so another big moment as an outsider that it feels like Etsy went through is during Covid. There's this huge transition to e-commerce, and I think Etsy was a big beneficiary of that. People wanting to buy more stuff online, go to stores less. And it feels like it was a huge accelerant for the business. I'm curious just what that experience was like leading the product team through that.
Tim Holley (00:13:51):
It was quite wild, I'll say that. And to be more specific, as many or all of us did in probably the world of tech at least, we went home not knowing what the next weeks or weeks as we thought would bring, turns out years. But when the CDC mandated face masks in, I think it was early April 2020, that's when essentially we went to sleep one day with our typical April traffic, typical April sales, and then it was Black Friday overnight.
(00:14:26):
And in part because nobody knew where to find face masks. Our sellers are incredibly astute business people. And if you had been making wedding dresses, and you know how to sew, and you've got material, and you've got a bit of time, making a mask is quite a simple task. And so we just saw this huge surge of demand, and then supply rising to meet it.
(00:14:47):
And we did something that far as I know we've never done an Etsy's past, which is we put out a call to our sellers to say, "Now's the time. Now's the time to make face masks if you can." And so it felt like this is our time to shine, to really help sellers continue to make sales, to help buyers find this critical item that they were looking for.
(00:15:08):
So it was a very, very exciting couple of weeks while we were kind of adapting to that change. And we were just really... Every day there would be standups. "What's happening? What do we need to change?"
(00:15:20):
I remember distinctly, we were worried about certain sellers not being able to meet the demand that they were seeing. And so we did the old-fashioned thing, of not personally, but we called them and we said, "How are you guys doing? What can we do to help?" And some people said, "We've got this, don't worry. This is squarely in our wheelhouse. We can absolutely meet the supply." And others said, "Actually, we need a little bit of help. We need to take a pause for a moment while we catch up with all these orders, and then we can come back to taking more."
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so just getting back to good old-fashioned know your customer, what do they need from you at that moment was just a really kind of powerful thing that took away from that time. 
(00:16:03):
And then from there, things kept going, and we really worked hard to make sure that the story was not just about face masks for our buyers, that they understood that Etsy's a place for so many different categories and so many different items. And that was then the next phase of the challenge. We got a huge influx of new or reactivated buyers. How do we keep them around? How do we make sure that the product does a little bit more work to retain them, and can really have hooks that bring them back time and again? And so that was kind of the journey that we then went on mid-2020, to probably the subsequent 18 months or so.
Lenny (00:16:39):
Is there anything you learned as a leader working in leading teams through that time? It must've been a pretty surreal experience, a lot of stress, people worrying about their own health.
Tim Holley (00:16:46):
I was one of the fortunate ones back then. No kids, worked in an industry that was clearly critical at the time. So I am in awe of how parents worked through that time. So stressful yes, but not to the extent that other people experienced the stress of Covid. 
(00:17:05):
We just tried a lot of stuff. I remember early on, I think we had maybe even daily, but at least three times a week coffee chats with the team, just like, "How are you guys doing? What's going on?" And at a certain point we realized all we're talking about is exactly the same things. Nobody wants to be on more calls and more video video chats. And so we just continued to evolve, and really try to keep a pulse on what the team needs.
(00:17:29):
And that, like I said, given context of being parents or whatever, differed pretty dramatically person to person. So definitely wasn't a one size fits all solution. That's more on the people side.
(00:17:40):
I think on the product side, as I mentioned, we were really starting to get focused on driving retention, or maybe said slightly differently, driving frequency. And that was a newer topic for us. We've long at Etsy been a really, and maybe rose-tinted glasses speaking a little bit, but a really great experiment, A/B testing driven culture. And so when you think about things like retention, you can absolutely test, course I'm not saying you can't, but you're looking at a different time horizon. Instead of someone making a purchase in that visit or in a week, you're looking at do they come back in 30 days, in 60 days, in 90 days?
(00:18:19):
And so that forced us out of our comfort zone to some degree in terms of how we understand, how we measure change, how long we're willing to wait to see it show up. Back to the incrementality point on minimizing waste, is this actually adding value to the business? And so those were great challenges to tackle, of course on a pretty heightened degree of intensity and focus from the business. But that was an exciting time.
Lenny (00:18:46):
Okay. So speaking of that, I want to chat about the marketplace and the marketplace you've built and things you've learned from building. I think it's one of the, I don't know, maybe top 10 marketplace businesses in the world, somewhere in there. And first of all, I'm curious just broadly, what have you learned is really important to just building a really successful thriving marketplace? And then I'll dig into more details. But just broadly, is there anything that comes to mind?
Tim Holley (00:19:09):
This narrative is still there, but I think we really focused heavily on the seller side, so the supply side of the business early on. And we really immersed ourselves in who sellers are, what they need, and how what they need maybe differs from what the solutions that they can find elsewhere.
(00:19:30):
Back in the day, we were doing studio visits with sellers. We were going to their workshops, we were going to their homes. We were seeing how they make items, we were seeing how they package and ship them out. We were bringing them into the office when we were running hack weeks to say, "Hey, we've got this crazy idea. Is this interesting?" So trying to involve them in the product development process to the extent that it was reasonable or feasible. 
(00:19:57):
And so I think that served us really well. We have a very deep and rich understanding of our sellers. And then the next phase and the more recent phase has been, how do we create a world-class buyer experience that ultimately drives sales for our sellers? Because when you have over 100 million items, all of which are unique, you've got a different challenge than when you have 10,000 SKUs that you could kind of find anywhere or on many retailers.
(00:20:22):
And so topics like structured data, topics like how do we help you gain confidence? Buyer this thing will meet your needs from a seller who you may never have heard of. They don't have a brand that you you've ever encountered before. And so we have some kind of somewhat unique challenges on that front where we need to lean into themes that other marketplaces absolutely touch on. 
(00:20:45):
For example, customer reviews play a big role in our experience, but they play a heightened role given the things I mentioned, right? Unique inventory from a seller that is maybe an independent person who is a single entrepreneur, it's one person. 
Lenny (00:21:04):
So you mentioned that initially, the focus was on sellers, which is really interesting because a lot of marketplaces, first of all need to figure out which side do we focus on? Who do we cater to most? And the way you described it is initially it was how do we make sure the sellers that are joining at Etsy are most well-served? And then later on it became more of a focus on the buyer side?
Tim Holley (00:21:22):
Yeah, I guess I'm painting it as a linear approach. It certainly was not. Because if you've got supply without demand, then you don't really have a marketplace. If you've got demand and no supply to meet it, then you also don't have a marketplace. So there's this flip-flop between, do you have enough supply to satiate the demand you have? And playing that out is certainly, I feel like art, not necessarily strictly science.
Lenny (00:21:48):
Yeah. So I'm curious how you all think about that actually. So at Airbnb, there's always this thinking of, who do we prioritize if we have to make a decision? is it host or guest? And it's shifted over the years at Airbnb. How do you all think about that as a, "Here's who we're going to prioritize if we really have to make a decision"?
Tim Holley (00:22:06):
And maybe to your point, that's also evolved at Etsy. And the place we're in at the moment is the job of a marketplace, even pre the technology definition of a marketplace is a seller will go there to make sales. And if they're not making sales, they probably won't go to that marketplace. And so we really see it as paramount that we have a qualified set of buyers who are looking for the items, the type of items our sellers are selling, and that we can help them make a purchase decision, and therefore a seller maker sale. 
(00:22:41):
That doesn't mean that every single team is working on building features for buyers because it doesn't work. Not least because you have a limited piece of real estate marketplace. And if you have too many teams working on it at one time, you'll end up getting in each other's way, and you won't be that productive. And so of course, we have a team that's laser focused on improving the seller experience. How do they list their inventory? How do they manage their sales? How do they fulfill their items? As one example.
(00:23:08):
But really back to the GMS is the north star, GMS represents a buyer buying from a seller. So it doesn't necessarily say build only for one of your audiences or one of your customers, but it says that that's really the job to be done here is helping facilitate that transaction.
Lenny (00:23:24):
That's exactly the same transition Airbnb went through. Initially it was focus on hosts, make sure hosts are the happiest people, and do everything we need to make them happy. And then eventually the business is the customers buying the product, and you have to make sure that they're the happy people. And sometimes you have to push hosts to do things they're not as excited to do for the good of the guest side.
Tim Holley (00:23:47):
And I think it's also the fact that we as the marketplace, and I'm curious if this was true at Airbnb as well, but we have the insight into information, into data, that an individual seller won't. And so we can help them make hopefully better decisions that lead to sales, leveraging the insights that we have. 
(00:24:06):
If you put an item on sale during this time period, chances are it's going to resonate with buyers, and you might get an incremental sale. And so trying to be really data-driven in how we help and guide sellers to take actions that we really believe will be valuable for them and their business, because simply, they're either a small business owner and so they don't have time to do that level of digging. Or it's simply not accessible to them because they have the worldview of their business, and we're looking at the entirety of the marketplace.
Lenny (00:24:37):
Maybe on this thread going a little nerdier, how do you think about supply constraint versus demand constraint? Is that something that comes up? I imagine maybe it's per category.
Tim Holley (00:24:45):
At the high level, we have 100 million items. So if you take that number at face value, you would think we do not have a supply constraint. We want to drive buyers to that supply. When you dig in maybe a more category, subcategory, sub subcategory level, that's where we do start to see pockets where, maybe we want to increase the type and the amount of inventory we have in wall decor. Seeing something behind you, that might not be the right example. But that's where we then start to focus and say, are there areas where we want to lean in?
(00:25:21):
Ultimately, really thinking about, how do we help buyers choose? Because that's when you have 100 million items and even in a sub subcategory or for a specific search query, you still generally have a lot of results to choose from. How do you distinguish one item or one seller from another, based on the needs that you have? When is it going to arrive? How much does it cost? Is it this size or that size? So really trying to lean into those types of things. And again, to some degree that's econ 101. But given the scale we're at, it is a pretty unique challenge.
Lenny (00:25:55):
What are ways you encourage your sellers to offer the things that you think you're lacking?
Tim Holley (00:26:01):
Back to that data-driven point, right? If we can clearly articulate that if you show more photos, you will help buyers understand your item in new ways, in deeper ways, then you're more likely to make a sale. That's maybe a somewhat reductive example, but those are the types of things where we generally know either through the data that we observe based on activity on the marketplace, and/or through the research we're doing, that this will be valuable. The challenge is often, we have so many things that we want our sellers to do. What's the most important thing for them to do right now? 
(00:26:37):
And that maybe changes somewhat seasonally. We're slowly starting to get towards the holiday season. And that just has a heightened purchase. It's a heightened time of purchasing. And contrast that with when it's around Mother's Day, maybe different type of inventory works really well. And so we need different inputs from our sellers. Because ultimately, they're business people. They have limited time in the day, and they want to spend time making. So how can we make sure that the time they spend on Etsy, managing their inventory, offering customer support is as valuable as possible?
Lenny (00:27:09):
So essentially in product messaging and recommendations that you're showing to the sellers is the way you communicate to them?
Tim Holley (00:27:16):
Yeah. And to some degree, we use the buyer experience to kind of signal what matters, right? When we're clearly highlighting photos, then that's obviously a very overly simple example.
Lenny (00:27:29):
Sellers [inaudible 00:27:30] here's what the search experience is highlighting.
Tim Holley (00:27:33):
As an example, yeah. And then really thinking about some of the signals or the snippets of information that we highlight. What goes into that? We know that great customer service a seller, they'll be responding to... We call them convos, but messages on our platform. They'll be responding really quickly. And that's something that we then highlight in the experience, and that if you're meeting that criteria, then we can start to signal to a buyer that, yes, this person offers really excellent customer service, and we can set your expectations accordingly.
Lenny (00:28:06):
Awesome. Yeah, we saw the same thing at Airbnb. One of the things that I worked on, that was one of the bigger shifts in the marketplace was shifting Airbnb to an instant buying experience. And many hosts didn't want that, because they really wanted to vet the guest and make sure they are happy with them. But it ended up being so important to conversion that we just encouraged them to turn it on. 
(00:28:25):
And one of the ways that worked best is exactly what you shared, where in the search experience, when someone came and searched, we just defaulted the search results to only show you instantly bookable listings. And hosts started to realize, "Oh shit, this is where things are going. I think I got to really take this seriously." And that worked really well.
Tim Holley (00:28:42):
Yeah, interesting. 
Lenny (00:28:43):
Pulling that thread a little bit more, I'm curious what you've seen as some of the bigger conversion wins on the buyer's side in terms of experiments you've run that have had some of the bigger impact.
Tim Holley (00:28:53):
I won't say we're consistently, because that suggests that we don't know what we're doing we do. We're often surprised by what works in an outsized way and what we think is going to be a knock it out of the park success, ends up being of minimal value. But coming back to maybe some of the themes alluded to earlier, reviews have long been really important. 
(00:29:13):
And when you're reviewing an item like I said, that's unique, that's from an independent seller, the type of information that another buyer is looking for is maybe a little different than other marketplaces, or even platforms that they might be shopping on.
(00:29:27):
And so really trying to lean into, well, what does it look like in a buyer's hand, in a buyer's home? Maybe that gives the next purchaser a bit more confidence that it's the right size, it's the right color, whatever it might be. And so that's long been a track that has been very fruitful for us, and continues to be something that we iterate on, that we focus on.
Lenny (00:29:47):
Just I understand, that essentially it's recommending to sellers, "Here's the photos you should have on your list."
Tim Holley (00:29:52):
Rather, collecting from buyers. So a seller will give us the photos that they're going to take, and then we can augment those with the, we call them buyer review photos. But ultimately, the experience the purchaser is having either through photo or video is super, super valuable.
Lenny (00:30:12):
Great. Okay, cool. So adding specific photos that you find help buyers convert. Keep going.
Tim Holley (00:30:18):
And then the other side is really leaning into maybe more the behavioral economic tactics of just helping buyers make decisions. Signals and nudges is how you'll see it referred to in literature. And we've seen great success in elevating little snippets of information that really help a buyer understand, "There is actually only one of these. Well, that's good information to know." It's something that then fits into their decision-making process that might've otherwise been buried.
(00:30:48):
And so really leaning into the quick summaries, the easy glanceable information that enables a buyer to gain enough confidence to say, "Yep, out of these 100 million items or the results for this search query, this is the one that I feel best about buying." We've seen lots of success on that track as well. 
Lenny (00:31:10):
That was a track at Airbnb as well. One of the ways they did this is they called it a rare gem, which is something that's available right now, that's very popular, and they created this kind of iconography for it. And engineers on the team ended up for Halloween dressing up as a rare gem. It became a whole thing at the company. And what's funny about Airbnb is every home is a one of a kind. There's only one left always, and there's always jokes about, "We should always be one left, you better book now."
Tim Holley (00:31:36):
I believe it was introduced... I don't believe. I know it was introduced as issue or a bug. But we ended up showing four stars and the fifth star when it was a half star, got rendered as a horse emoji. And so for a second there on Etsy, we had four stars and a horse showing up for some of our review ratings. And that spawned a huge amount of internal fun. And then back to your point around Halloween, we had a few teams being four stars and a horse. It was pretty interesting. 
Lenny (00:32:15):
Was it like five people were four people were a star and there's a horse person?
Tim Holley (00:32:18):
Yeah, exactly.
Lenny (00:32:21):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. 
(00:32:43):
Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. 
(00:33:01):
Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53, and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.
(00:33:27):
So going down this track a little bit more, one of the biggest wins for Airbnb's search experience was this very small idea of just, what if you open each listing in the search results in a new tab, and ended up converting 1%, like increasing conversion by 1%? Is there anything like that that you remember that you've done of just like, "Holy moly, that was so simple, but such a big win"?
Tim Holley (00:33:47):
Yeah, we have similar learnings around that exact example. Oftentimes I think about effort and reward. So it might be a smallish GMS win or conversion rate win, but it was a one line text change. And we've seen those where we add a small snippet of, maybe we feel like it's almost marketing copy, and it ends up having an outsized impact. 
(00:34:13):
We had one example where we added some text to the cart experience, and we just saw huge uplift that we really, really didn't expect. It was more us communicating our values as a business, and it was something that really seemed to resonate with our buyers. And so that drove conversion. We've got examples where it's a one line copy change, and it's quite shocking the impact that that can have.
Lenny (00:34:37):
I'm curious what that change actually was, the text change that had that much impact, if you can recall.
Tim Holley (00:34:42):
We've long and continued to invest in sustainability, and the text change was in our cart where we call out Etsy offsets carbon emissions from every delivery. And just adding that simple line of text was something that, like I said, really resonated with our buyers and the type of customer that comes to Etsy, and really drove conversion.
Lenny (00:35:03):
I had Ronny Kohavi on the podcast who's one of the lead experts on experimentation, and he had the stat that 80% of experiments fail at each company on average. Does that sound about right in terms of how you guys find experiments working out? 
Tim Holley (00:35:18):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:35:18):
Awesome. Okay. What is your just general philosophy and experimentation? Does everything run as an experiment? Do things sometimes not run an experiment? How do you think about that at Etsy?
Tim Holley (00:35:28):
Right now, the vast majority of our changes do. And to be perfectly candid, I think that's one of our growth edges as a product org, and maybe even as a company, is bringing in different ways to validate changes. Because to some degree, or maybe the way I think about experimentation, that's the highest bar. That proves with near absolute certainty that there's a causal relationship between the change you made and the KPI that you want to move.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]But I think that it maybe misses the point in some changes or some areas where you are working towards a bigger net new thing or this specific change won't really be indicative of the greater whole you're building towards.
(00:36:14):
So like I said, I mentioned earlier, we've long been a very A/B testing driven organization, not least because Etsy's background and history has deep, deep roots in an incredible engineering culture. And so that's really tried and true. So the vast majority of things are tested in that way. 
(00:36:33):
We're expanding how we think about looking at cohorts over time. I mentioned retention earlier, that to some degree, it necessitates a different type of test. When we look at our SEO work, you can't think about it in exactly the same ways.
(00:36:46):
But the through line is, is the change that we're making adding value? And that's what we want to try to understand. A/B testing is a great way to do that. There are others, some of which we're starting to employ, others that we we'll continue to investigate and think about how we can leverage.
Lenny (00:37:02):
Is there an example of anything? And if there's not, that's totally cool, of something that you shipped that was maybe negative on an experiment results, or you just didn't want to write as an experiment.
Tim Holley (00:37:12):
When we're collecting inputs from sellers, we just simply don't feel it's appropriate to not either show or honor. We talk about a tried and true practice of sales and discounting. If a seller offers something on sale, then we need to show that. We are really curious about how that actually drives buyer behavior. And there's ways that we can kind of construct pre-post analysis and things like that to try to understand the impact. But ultimately, those are the kind of areas where we err on the side looking at our data in different ways. And so we have maybe a slightly different degree of confidence in the value, but we're still confident that it does help the marketplace as a whole.
Lenny (00:37:55):
That's a great example. Yeah, I'm not sure what I do there. That is tricky. So we've been talking about conversion. I'm curious in terms of acquisition, what you've seen work. And just generally, how do people find Etsy? How do you drive top of funnel for Etsy?
Tim Holley (00:38:06):
Yes. There's two sides to Etsy, right? There's the seller and the buyer. Getting in the Wayback Machine, on the seller side, we would be at craft fairs like Renegade and other places where our sellers were selling in person and really letting them know that Etsy exists. And so that was very boots on the ground, let's get out and try to acquire sellers into the marketplace. Some of that predates me to some degree. We were probably doing it on the tail end when I joined.
(00:38:37):
And then we have a lot of great word of mouth through our sellers. A seller probably knows other people who are similarly inclined to be incredible craftspeople, who want to sell their items. And so we've seen some success with our... We have a Teams platform where sellers can come together, ask each other questions, and the word of mouth type of growth through that.
(00:38:56):
On the buyer side, we really leveraged the fact that we have a ton of inventory. And to some degree, it ends up being quite a long tail of inventory where we can meet really niche and specific needs. And so that lends itself really well to thinking about SEO, lends itself really well to thinking about Google Shopping, where someone is not on Etsy, but is often looking for something either somewhat or very specific. And we can really meet their needs in a really meaningful way by showing them not only just a single item, but maybe that and then other options that they might find that are of a similar vein, in a similar, sub categories in some cases. And so those have been long tried and true areas that we've invested in, and we've seen really great success in driving new buyers to Etsy.
Lenny (00:39:44):
I've researched and written about that story of how Etsy started with sellers and craft fairs. And so that's a really classic story. And I think there's also an element of the early sellers drove the early buyers, because they're just advertising their listing page, "Here's where you could go buying," which is a really unfair rare, opportunity to grow the marketplace by just focusing on sellers.
Tim Holley (00:40:04):
I mean, yes, and a seller is a buyer. And so if they're making something that they've poured their heart into, chances are they will value that exact same behavior in someone else. And so if they're selling an item, they're looking for other things in maybe not their exact category, but in adjacent categories, and they become buyers. So it is a nice dynamic when that starts to work.
Lenny (00:40:29):
Yeah. So many natural advantages to getting this marketplace off the ground. How cool is that? You mentioned word of mouth as a big part of how Etsy started spreading. I imagine even today there's a lot of just, "Hey, you should check out Etsy." Is there anything you've done that accelerates word of mouth or build on word of mouth, referrals comes to mind? Is there anything along those lines?
Tim Holley (00:40:46):
Yeah, we dabbled with referral programs a while ago, probably eight some years ago. What we saw, it was a different time. And so I think we maybe didn't value a new buyer, for example, in the way we do today. Because to some degree, you're unlocking future value. They make a single purchase, and then the bet is over time they'll go on to make subsequent purchases. We didn't necessarily have that as deep an understanding then as we do now. So our buyer referral program ultimately wasn't a huge success.
(00:41:15):
But on the seller side, this was back in the days of Dropbox referral program being a huge, huge driver of their growth, and the whole get concept that was really prevalent back then. And on the seller side, one of the things that we really leaned into was, on Etsy, for those who aren't familiar, it costs 20 cents to list an item.
(00:41:36):
And that may seem like a very small financial outlay to get started, but it's a little bit of a barrier. And the more we can do to remove those, the higher chance that someone will either become a seller or list more items.
(00:41:51):
So we really leaned into that as the currency for the seller referral program. And coming back to what I said around Teams, that was a really great way to supercharge some of that activity that was either happening, but more of it could happen, or really helping a seller understand, "Oh yeah, there is a hook here. If I offer this person, I refer them, they'll get some listing credits. It'll be easier for them to open their shop. And then when I need to list more items, I also have credits that I can apply." So that was one small area. I wouldn't say it was a huge driver of growth. But in certain markets, in certain pockets, we saw it work pretty well.
Lenny (00:42:27):
Awesome. That also helps with fraud, which is a huge problem with referral programs where the credit is just, you can list on Etsy. It's not like you can steal a lot of money away from the business. So that's clever.
Tim Holley (00:42:39):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:42:40):
Okay. I want to talk about one other part of the funnel, retention. Is there anything you've learned that has been really effective to help with the retention?
Tim Holley (00:42:46):
We have long had features that are retentive in their nature. Things like, on Etsy, we call them favorites. That might be liking or a similar action on other places. But how do we think about the habit loop of if you take an action, what's the trigger and then what's the reward? 
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so using a favorite as an example, you favorite an item. That's a pretty strong ish... Of course, adding it to your cart or maybe purchasing it, that's the strongest of signals, but you've shown intent. 
(00:43:21):
So what can we do with that information? We can then say, "The seller put it on sale. You should come back and check it out. This is selling out. There's only one of this item left. You showed some intent, you might want to come back and get it." And that's just one example of trying to close those loops.
(00:43:35):
And that's where we've worked on things like, we call it the updates feed, essentially a feed of activity that you've taken, that we're demonstrating how it's changed, what's new, and then pulling in the tried and true tactic of push notifications to make you aware of that, such that you're using your phone all the time. You see that show up. That's a pretty great notification to get right. "The thing that I really liked is now on sale. I want to check that out."
(00:44:00):
And so those are examples where really leaning into that habit loop framework has helped us understand, we've got a lot of this activity. How do we close the loop? How do we make it really valuable for our buyers?
Lenny (00:44:11):
Zooming out a little bit, it's kind of wild that Etsy can exist in a world of eBay and Amazon. And I'm just curious what it is that you think the founders and the team did early on to carve out this space of, I know you could buy things from people, you can buy things on Amazon really quickly, to create a world where Etsy builds this massive business that continues to thrive. What do you think was done so well to carve out the space?
Tim Holley (00:44:36):
I think that to some degree, resolves down to... And maybe that's a little too extreme, but a key component is the brand. The brand stands for something in people's minds. And that helps understand you're not going to get the same inventory on Etsy. You shouldn't expect the same inventory on Etsy as you might be looking for on eBay. It doesn't make sense to our buyers. The items that our sellers sell are unique. 
(00:45:07):
And so I think that as the core nugget, combined with how we think about policies, and our way to some degree, maintain the integrity of the marketplace, those two things combined do set us apart. And I think if you ask many people, certainly here in the US, what they think of Etsy, a very specific image will be conjured up. That may be one that we want to evolve and build on, but it feels quite distinct. 
(00:45:37):
And it's not the same as eBay and it's not the same as Amazon. And I think there's real deep value in that. And I wasn't here at the very beginning, but it's certainly something that was there at the very beginning of Etsy, that is still a through line to where we are today.
Lenny (00:45:53):
That makes absolute sense to me. On the other hand, I also don't know how that happens. Is there anything that you think about, of how the team did that and how they built that brand? What are some of the important elements? Is that a specific aesthetic? Is it a certain type of supply that you stuck to? What do you think was so important to building that brand?
Tim Holley (00:46:12):
I think it is the supply. If you think about the marketplace, the vast majority of content is maybe what we might consider UGC. It's either the item is from the seller. Or as was mentioning before, the buyer review is from the buyer. And so just being really clear about what's okay to sell and what's not okay, I think does really differentiate us. 
(00:46:38):
I also think over the years, our brand, and our aesthetic, and how we position ourselves has evolved, will continue to evolve as it should. But to the point where we are now, the statement we have is keep commerce human. And that feels really simple, super pithy, easy to remember, but has lineage when you go all the way back to where we started in terms of really valuing the unique, valuing the handmade. And so that does permeate decision making, how we show up, the type of features we work on, the things we would prioritize. Maybe never say never, but an item getting dropped off by a drone and a person never touches it, that doesn't feel very Etsy. That's not something that we might lean into.
Lenny (00:47:22):
It's interesting how many parallels Etsy has to Airbnb, because Airbnb is the same general idea. People's homes, people making things. And then also, I think the tagline for Airbnb early on was travel like a human. So it was actually a really similar concept.
Tim Holley (00:47:35):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:47:36):
Which touches on a question I wanted to talk about, which is many marketplaces as they grow, become supply constrained. And then there's this pressure to add different types of supply. In Airbnb's case, it was, "We should add hotels, we should add property management, vacation rental companies on here. We should have everything people want to book, because we're losing business. They could book anything here, they should be able to." But the tension is, then we become like everyone else. And then what is Airbnb in that case? 
(00:48:04):
And I think you went through that experience where there was a lot of cheap products from overseas, and it was kind of being flooded. Is that true, I guess? And then just how do you think about that limit, and where you draw that line?
Tim Holley (00:48:17):
Yeah, I think it does come back to some degree to the brand and the policy point from just before. And we take enforcing our policies really seriously. It's not an easy job at our scale, and that means we need to continue to invest and continue to make sure that only the best items, the most relevant items are on Etsy. That job is never done. The team that that works super, super hard, and is always looking for new signals to understand what maybe doesn't meet our criteria.
(00:48:49):
Generally speaking, supply is something that we have in spades for the most part. Back to the point we talked about earlier, one of the things that we grappled with was around, how can we help sellers scale? They sell great inventory, but maybe they just don't have enough of it, or they can't meet the demand, because they're making everything by hand.
(00:49:10):
So one of the things that there was an evolution, was leaning into what today we call production assistance. And the way I think about that is you still need to understand the provenance of your item. If you are saying, "I have this design, I'm just going to throw it over the fence to a manufacturer that I've never met, that I don't know. I don't understand their processes, I may not agree with them," that doesn't meet our criteria. You need to understand how it's being made, who is making it, have a relationship with the person who's helping you scale your business. But that's something that we saw from people who maybe gravitate more towards being designers than being able to actually make the thing. They have this excellent idea, they just can't see it come to life.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so they need some help. And that was something we leaned into to be able to, like I said, help sellers that maybe weren't able to make a thing and sell it on Etsy. Or for sellers who were reaching the limits of what they could supply, really take it to the next level, and make more items such that they could make more sales.
Lenny (00:50:10):
So it sounds like essentially, this is just evolving definition of what a supplies allowed on Etsy, a team that stays on top of that. Imagine there was just a hard decision at one point of just, "We will limit supply, and here's the supply that we want on the platform. Everything else we're going to take off."
Tim Holley (00:50:25):
We would limit the type of items, the number of those items, that as we talked about, there's a lot of them. But really having that clear definition. In some cases, it's easy. Some things, they violate legal definitions. And those things, that's the easy stuff to think about. It's where it's a little more gray, that it gets a little trickier.
Lenny (00:50:47):
That reminds me, so my wife is actually a designer, and she produces these hilarious charts about life stuff. And people take her designs and just sell them on every platform on Zazzle, and probably Etsy, but everywhere. And she's always trying to hunt them down and get them to take them off. But it's such a pain for a small designer. It's not an Etsy problem, it's just a general internet problem.
Tim Holley (00:51:08):
Yeah. And back to the, we have teams hard at work thinking about IP, and how to police it, how to enforce it. 
Lenny (00:51:16):
It's tough.
Tim Holley (00:51:17):
Not a domain I will suggest I'm an expert in, really, really tricky stuff, but we've got to be beyond that.
Lenny (00:51:23):
Yeah. Another I think problem that's sort of unique to Etsy, something that I think people call the graduation problem. Which is where you join Etsy, things start to grow, you become really successful. And then you're like, "Why am I paying Etsy all these fees? Why don't I just make my own website and just sell it directly, and not pay any fees?" And I think you guys went through that. And so if that's true, is there anything you've learned about just how to avoid getting people to want to leave?
Tim Holley (00:51:48):
I think the core thought there is, our fees are generally low and highly competitive. So from that perspective, there's a reason to stay on Etsy. What we've seen and what we know, our sellers are really smart business people. And so if they can distribute their products through another channel, that might be their own website, another marketplace in person. Probably going to try to do that. They want to make more sales. Not all, but many of them are wired to want to grow their business.
(00:52:21):
And so really understanding the role that we play in that construct of distribution channels to make it a little reductive is really helpful to understand. And to some degree, we want to be the place that not only they make sales on, but they love to sell on, because our tools are really catered to the needs that they have.
(00:52:42):
So there is some degree of stickiness. I mentioned Teams earlier. There are places where sellers go to congregate, share ideas, share grievances in some cases, but ultimately support each other. And so there are reasons to stick around. I'm sure there certainly sellers who scale out of Etsy who realize, "I want to build my own website," to the example you cited. The reality is that's neither cheap nor fast. It's hard work. It's hard work to build, hard work to maintain, expensive to drive traffic to. And so that may be a part of the way they want to take their business, but oftentimes, Etsy still does play a role in how they're thinking, about where they make sales, and ultimately where they're going to see growth from.
Lenny (00:53:24):
The cool thing that I saw online about you, is that you built a marketplace essentially within Etsy called Etsy Studio. And I'm not sure if that's around anymore, but I'm curious what the story there was, and what you learned from that experience, and current status.
Tim Holley (00:53:40):
Yeah, well researched. Because no, it is no longer around. The white space we saw with studio was essentially saying, on the one hand you've got Pinterest fails, right? You've got all these great inspiring items or projects on Pinterest, and then you have people who've no idea how to make them, and they get so frustrated.
(00:54:01):
And then on the other hand, you've got a marketplace like Michael's, or these other places where you might go for craft supplies. They have stuff, but they don't necessarily have inspiration. And how can we play in that intersection of the idea and the items and the tutorials to see that idea come to life?
(00:54:21):
So the genesis of the idea, felt from a brand perspective, super aligned. We stand for creativity, we stand for makers. And so we saw it as a big opportunity. The launch happened to coincide with the pivot in 2017, to really focusing on the core marketplace or refocusing on the core marketplace, maybe I should say. 
(00:54:41):
And so it became clear that when we laid out what we're optimizing for, which is driving sales in the short term, marketing dollars being as ROI positive as possible, having teams focused on the core marketplace, it didn't check any of those boxes. And so really, really tough decision and hard to manage through, but that was ultimately the right call for the business to say, "This no longer makes sense given the new constraints that we're operating in, given the new goals that we have."
Lenny (00:55:10):
Makes sense. Also something that happened to Airbnb a lot, trying new things that they didn't work out, had to move on. 
Tim Holley (00:55:15):
Yep.
Lenny (00:55:16):
That's how it goes. 
Tim Holley (00:55:17):
Yep.
Lenny (00:55:18):
Shifting a little bit to just product leadership and writing the product team, and just a few more questions, what's something that you've found to be really important to having a productive, well run, well executing product team?
Tim Holley (00:55:31):
Yeah. One of the things that's certainly not completely novel but I think we have a pretty unique interpretation of is how we collaborate between functions. You'll often hear the three legs of the stool where you've got product and engine design,, and we've evolved that to five legs of the stool. And I fully recognize that a five legged stool probably is not a very stable thing, but go with the analogy for a second-
Lenny (00:55:56):
I think it's even more stable. Is that the most stable stool or is it less stable with five legs?
Tim Holley (00:56:00):
You probably need a really flat surface. 
Lenny (00:56:02):
That makes sense.
Tim Holley (00:56:03):
Regardless, of course we've got product eng design and we've got our insights partners. So research and analytics, and we've got our marketing partners really working in a tight team to build the best products possible. And so I think that we can continue to get better absolutely, at how we make decisions and how we bring the various viewpoints together. So to some degree it's not the easiest path, but it's the best path I think, where you're really incorporating different viewpoints, different constraints, different considerations into the features and the products that we're building. And treating that as the core leadership team I think is really valuable.
(00:56:45):
And maybe that's partly because generally, we don't subscribe to this idea of PM as the mini CEO. You're up there directing from on high that we're going to build that feature and we're going to do that. And that's just not the type of culture that we have, and generally speaking from what I've seen, doesn't lead to good decisions or the best features or product being built. And so collaboration is something we really value and that we try to live through how we structure our teams, how we make our decisions. Is it perfect? Like I said, absolutely not. I think it's the way that we've found being really successful building product.
Lenny (00:57:21):
Do you give the PM just a little more say in decision making and ask? Because with five people in the leadership team, you talked about how back in the day, it was like too consensus driven maybe, and I wonder how you navigate that with five decision makers.
Tim Holley (00:57:35):
Yeah, we're always looking to clarify, or re-clarify, or restate who ultimately is accountable. And in many cases it is the PM, right? You are the one who Nick, our CPO like to say you don't have to have the best ideas, but you have to choose the best ideas. And so really figuring out how you're selecting what you're going to build and then living with the consequences.
(00:58:00):
Of course ideally, successful. In many cases, back to your 80% stat that 80% of experiments don't work, owning what's next, right? Okay, did we learn from that? If we did, what are we going to do about it? That definitely does fall to the PM. It doesn't give you the permission to ignore other viewpoints or make decisions in a vacuum. It's certainly not that. But ultimately, when we need to move forward, it is the PM that is on the hook for those things.
Lenny (00:58:26):
Awesome. So essentially, the PM can make the call if there's an unclear consensus?
Tim Holley (00:58:33):
And given so many places are, but we're so heavily led by the insights either qual or quant. The decision in many instances is clear. When it's not, that's when we need the product person to step forward and say, "We're going in this direction." Don't know if it's going to work out, but we'll certainly learn and we'll move forward.
Lenny (00:58:50):
Awesome. And then just to go on this topic a little bit more, your teams are cross-functional dedicated teams. I imagine it sounds like there's these five leads for each team. Is that roughly how you organize?
Tim Holley (00:59:01):
Yeah. And the fifth leg, if you will, of marketing, that might be product marketing in some cases, that might be brand marketing in others. And so there's kind of different flavors of marketing that we pull in, based on the specific needs of the project. But that's generally speaking how we try to structure our teams from kind of the group level all the way down to the individual squad. We can't always have a dedicated research, and a dedicated analyst, and a dedicated product marketer to every single team. So it's certainly not perfect, but that's where we aspire to having at least coverage on those roles.
Lenny (00:59:37):
Got it. So most teams have dedicated marketing person or a product marketing person. That's crazy. That's really rare, but interesting.
Tim Holley (00:59:43):
Some teams-
Lenny (00:59:43):
Some teams that I imagine are most in need of marketing support. Got it. Are you able to just paint a rough picture of the way the teams are laid out at Etsy? I imagine there's a buyer side and a seller side. How does that look for people to make sense-
Tim Holley (00:59:57):
Yeah. The way that we think about the structure right now, and the org design should ideally follow strategy. And if your strategy is always evolving, then your org design is always evolving. We call it the product stack. And so we've got our core customer teams, who are unsurprisingly thinking about buyers and sellers. And so they're the ones on the front lines with the customers.
(01:00:26):
Then we have, we call them our partner teams, and so they are working directly with the end customer. So think an organization like payments where they have clearly a way to capture payment from a buyer to remit funds to a seller, so they're really on the front lines with the customer. They also have other constraints working with the payment networks, and card providers, and things like that, so they just have a slightly different model. So core customer, partner teams, enablement teams that are really in service of helping deliver the best possible experience. That might be through our recommender systems or through our design system, in order to make developing that little bit easier, a little bit faster, a little bit more standardized in some cases. And then the foundation of it all sits with infrastructure, and the teams that you might expect that are much more technical in nature, that really, without that, we wouldn't have a website.
Lenny (01:01:20):
When you're hiring a product manager, is there anything that you found to be really important or interesting, or maybe a unique insight into hiring teams?
Tim Holley (01:01:28):
The three things that I come back to time and again, is one, the collaboration piece that we talked about earlier. Not only a willingness, but a real excitement to do that. It's not everyone's bag. I get that. Some people just want to be in a make fast decisions and move forward place. We aim to make fast decisions, but you need to consult. That's one.
(01:01:49):
Two is being decisive. We have tons of data, but it's not always clear exactly what to do with that, or we're using a new input. Maybe back to the point mentioned earlier of looking at competitive insights, let's make a decision, let's move forward. Let's ideally learn. Even if we're not making progress against our goals, we're at a minimum learning. 
(01:02:10):
And then the third point is just curiosity. Because we're a relatively small organization with... Everyone says, "If only we had more people," but we are quite small. 
(01:02:20):
So there is a lot of change. There's a lot of new priorities that crop up, and that means there's a lot of opportunity for the right folks, right? If I want to be in this space, and only this space, and this is my specific domain, and I just want to be in it forever more, that might be a little more challenging, because you might be asked to work on something net new. And so just having that curiosity mindset of saying, or maybe said differently growth mindset of, "Okay, there's something to learn from the thing I'm being asked to do, let me really lean into that."
(01:02:47):
And to some degree, I'm not describing anything that's atypical of great product people overall. But I think we have either a slightly different flavor or we need it in a slightly different way here at Etsy.
Lenny (01:02:59):
Awesome. Last question, before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Is there a framework or a process that you find really useful, that you find yourself coming back to, that you think listeners would potentially find really valuable?
Tim Holley (01:03:11):
I won't pretend to know whether listeners find it valuable. But the thing that I do a lot, that we do as my team, that others do to some degree is a simple exercise of weekly focus. What are you focused on this week? And then reflecting on, did you get done the things you were focused on last week? Seems super simple, but just the exercise of thinking about what matters, writing it down, and having a little bit of social proof or articulating it out to others creates some degree of accountability, is something that is very, very easy and simple to do.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And if you do it consistently, you start to see some really great patterns of, "Those types of focus areas take me longer than I think. I should budget more time." Or, "These are the type of things that crop up. At this time of year, I might need to start thinking about making some space for them." So I've just found that to be really, really, really helpful in the day-to-day.
Lenny (01:04:06):
I love that. How do you operationalize that? Is it like a Slack channel people post these in, is it a Docs?
Tim Holley (01:04:11):
Yeah. In our buyer experience product channel, on Mondays, everyone's kind of sharing what they're focused on. How last week panned out, was it done? Is it still in progress? Things like that. It's very, very lo-fi, but it worked pretty well.
Lenny (01:04:25):
So it's kind of like a standup that happens once a week, and it's higher level essentially is what it sounds like?
Tim Holley (01:04:30):
Exactly, exactly. Trying to think about the priorities and not tasks. And that is a blurry line. I fully recognize that. But anchoring in those I think is certainly for me, personally more helpful.
Lenny (01:04:41):
And is the comedian person in these and sharing funny things in the standup-
Tim Holley (01:04:46):
No, unfortunately, or fortunately, he's now actually a comedian.
Lenny (01:05:52):
Are you serious he became a full time comedian? That’s amazing. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Tim Holley (01:04:58):
Hit me.
Lenny (01:04:59):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Tim Holley (01:05:03):
Couple that come to mind Team of Teams by Stanley McChrystal has been, I think is just A, really fascinating read, and B, helped me think a lot about how you trust teams and how you think about disseminating decision-making to the right folks, tech language, push decisions to the edges. But thinking about it in the context that he describes there is really fascinating, and it just shows that it can work even in the most egregious world of military, which you think is top-down command and control, shows that there's a different way to approach problems.
Lenny (01:05:42):
I was actually a fan favorite at Airbnb also.
Tim Holley (01:05:45):
Oh, cool. Other is back all the way to the top to what I love to do. Surfing and being outdoors. Let My People Go Surfing by Yvon Chouinard, the Patagonia founder. Incredibly fascinating read of someone who just had a deep, deep passion, turned it into a business, struggled, iterated, came out the other side really successful. So the business side, but also just how they think about treating their employees and the culture that they've built I think is to me personally, really inspiring. There's a theme here around trust and how you engage with people to make their day-to-day work lives, is really fulfilling. So that's another favorite.
And then in a super different direction, Power Broker by Robert Caro. That is an absolute tone. It is huge. It took me probably an entire year to read because I'm an extremely slow reader and/or I fell asleep a lot. But it is so fascinating, especially living in New York, of how one human had such an incredibly outsized and probably terrible impact on the city. Access to waterfronts, really thinking about communities and tearing them apart. Just such a fascinating read.
Lenny (01:06:56):
I have that book, and I've never read it. It's very long and intimidating. I think it might be back there, maybe in a different-
Tim Holley (01:07:01):
I would chunk it out. Do a couple of chapters at a time, otherwise it feels insurmountable.
Lenny (01:07:07):
It's like infinite Infinite Jest where you're intimidated. Amazing. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Tim Holley (01:07:15)
So my wife and I talk about this a lot. I think we're Western Files, if that's a thing. I'm from Europe and so it's a whole new world, different world for me. We've loved Yellowstone and all of the, I guess they're prequels. They've been just really, really fun to watch for people who are curious about that culture and that world.
Lenny (01:07:35):
Awesome. It's also been hard to find where to even watch it. It's on the weirdest channels.
Tim Holley (01:07:39):
It is one of those where the old world of, we cut all our cords and we only needed Netflix. Suddenly you need all these really random providers of content that you're like, "I have to subscribe to that now to watch this show?"
Lenny (01:07:51):
Don't understand where this even is. Just take my money. Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?
Tim Holley (01:07:58)
I'm a big fan of case studies, live case studies. I think you learn a whole boatload about how someone thinks on the fly, how they react to constraints. So we use those. I've used those a ton. We use them pretty heavily in product interviews. So I love those modulated for the type of business you're in, what you're actually trying to understand.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]The other one I like to ask is around something that people have taught themselves, tried to get at a growth mindset. I think Julia, who was on the podcast a while ago, said something similar. But you get a ton of insight into someone. Ideally, you get a bit of passion and you often get something to go research. She's like, "I don't know anything about that topic. I want to learn a little more."
Lenny (01:08:40)
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?
Tim Holley (01:08:44):
You as a new parent maybe resonates when... So it's not new, because our kids too. But when I was looking, being in product, of course you want to track data. And so I was looking for apps that would be good at doing that, and they nearly all look like hideous medical charts where I just don't want to engage with that. 
I found this one app, I think it's called Nara Baby or Nara something. Super simple, allows both parents to enter information. Probably grandparents too. We only tested it with two people. Seamlessly syncs. Really easy to use. So at 4:00 AM when you can't see and you just want to say, "I fed the baby," you can do that really easily. Just really, really simple, fit for purpose product. So that resonated with me.
Lenny (01:09:31):
I'm going to be downloading that right now. I've been using Huckleberry, which is both awesome and not awesome, and so awesome tip. Great. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat often or share with other people, either in work or in life?
Tim Holley (01:09:44):
One of the things I talk about maybe internally more than anything else, but all or nothing. Go all in. Go do the thing. In German [German 01:10:08]. I grew up in Germany, so that's something I say to myself a lot is if you're going to do it, do it properly. I think those are often helpful words to live by.
Lenny (01:10:04):
I love that. Final question, what's a favorite item you recently discovered on Etsy?
Tim Holley (01:10:10):
I recently bought an engraved whiskey decanter for my wife and myself, or for the home. Super beautiful, so cool. Got it personalized with our names. Just such a cool, cool item, that I wasn't expecting to find that kind of thing. I'm not even sure exactly how you engrave a whiskey decanter, but it was really cool. And the other thing, I'm always on the lookout for greeting cards. If anyone has great greeting card seller recommendations, I'm all ears. I love giving out physical greetings cards to folks, so that's another always on Etsy favorite of mine.
Lenny (01:10:51):
Tim, we've talked about growth, culture, surfing, cabins, leadership. Thank you so much for being here. I'm downloading the Nara app right now as we speak. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Tim Holley (01:11:06):
Yeah, yeah, find me on LinkedIn. That's probably... Well, not probably, is my most professional platform. Instagram, like I said, is a farce. And being useful. Yeah, send me things that you're excited about in the Etsy product. Send me feedback. We're always really keen to learn how folks are experiencing the things that we build.
Lenny (01:11:26)
Amazing. Tim, thank you so much for being here.
Tim Holley (01:11:28)
Thank you for having me, Lenny. Appreciate it.

# The ultimate guide to paid growth | Timothy Davis (Shopify)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Is performance marketing just something every company should be doing?

Timothy Davis (00:00:02):
Hot take, paid is for everyone. If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
When you take over for an agency at a company, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you find they are doing wrong?

Timothy Davis (00:00:20):
Instead of thinking about being on top of the page, and that's like ego marketing, I want to be number one. I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
Any other tips for people just to experiment with the platform?

Timothy Davis (00:00:33):
Each platform is different. The user behavior is different. Make sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. It's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Today, my guest is Timothy Davis. Timothy has led performance marketing for all of Shopify for the past two and a half years, and as a consultant has helped companies like Pinterest, LinkedIn, Redfin, and Eventbrite kickstart and scale the performance marketing teams. In our conversation, we get incredibly tactical on all things to performance marketing and paid growth, when to start investing, how to run signs of life tests on each platform, what platforms to investigate and what platforms to bet big on, what types of companies are best suited to invest big on paid growth whether you should invest pre-product market fit or not, what agencies often get wrong and what to look for in your investment when you're just getting started? Plus, what your first three hires should look like, tips for which platforms are most interesting right now, a peek at Timothy's actual reports that he runs to judge performance, if you're watching this on YouTube and so much more.

(00:01:37):
This episode is for anyone who's trying to figure out how to kickstart or improve their performance marketing investment, and I guarantee you'll get something out of this that'll make your life better.

It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Timothy Davis. Timothy, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Timothy Davis (00:02:04):
Yeah, thanks for having me. A long time coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:06):
Yeah, I'm really excited we're finally doing this. I actually posted on Twitter for people to suggest questions for this topic and there's just so much interest in what we're going to be talking about, which essentially we're going to be diving deep into all things paid growth, all things performance marketing. By the way, I have a cold. For people, if in case you wonder why I sound a little weird, but the show must go on. I want to start with just setting a little context for folks that aren't super familiar with performance marketing and paid growth. When we talk about performance marketing/paid growth, first of all, are those two terms interchangeable to you? And second of all, what falls under the umbrella of performance marketing/paid growth?

Timothy Davis (00:02:42):
Paid can be a lot of things. It can be online, it can be offline, it can also even be affiliates. Typically, when I talk about performance marketing, it's about online only, but you could argue offline could be performing and affiliates could be performing and stuff like that. They can be interchangeable, but I would recommend if you are talking about it, to specify which one you're talking about. Because when you do say paid, because I'm in the industry, I would just, "Oh, they do Google Search and they do Meta and they do things like that." But if you do offline and you just say paid, we may be talking about things, but missing each other on two ships passing in the night. So I think historically, people, when they have said paid growth, have been fully focused on just online.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:43):
Just online. Okay. Got it.

Timothy Davis (00:03:31):
But I would argue in the last couple of years, you could definitely roll offline into that conversation as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:38):
Okay. So performance marketing, when someone hears that term, it's essentially marketing that you can measure the performance up.

Timothy Davis (00:03:43):
Correct. Yes, nail on the head.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:46):

I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:07):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:25):
Yes. So we just launched OneSchema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:47):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:58):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:18):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema. co.

(00:06:32):
Is performance marketing just something every company should be doing or is there certain business models where it's like, "No, you're probably going to grow through other channels mostly like SEO or sales or word of mouth.

Timothy Davis (00:06:42):
Hot take. I would say, paid is for everyone. If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google introducing AI, plus with paid taking up the first four spots, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now. You have to do promoted posts for people to even see your content. I would say it does depend on the industry you're in. If you're say, leaning heavily into influencer marketing, that is still a paid component. You may not be doing Meta ads, you may not be doing paid search, but that is a paid component. But I would say at baseline, everyone should be doing paid search. The way I usually explain it to people is paid search is user driven. You have to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show.

(00:07:36):
Anything else is more disruptive media. You're on Meta and you're looking at pictures of babies and cats, and then all of a sudden, you see an ad for Shopify. You're watching a YouTube video, maybe a YouTube podcast, and then in between, you get advertisements maybe for Shopify, maybe for Pinterest, maybe for Eventbrite. So all of that being disruptive media may not make a whole lot of sense for where you are as a business, but I would say paid search being user-driven, having to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show, should pretty much be for just about everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
Everyone should do it. Super interesting. There's also the most companies grow through one growth engine primarily, say word of mouth, or SEO, or sales or paid. So for some companies, paid will be most of how they grow like say, I always think of Booking.com and Credit Karma and just like most of their growth came from paid growth online, paid growth. For some companies, it's just like a layer, a small 10, 20% of their growth. What are signs that you have the potential for paid/performance marketing to be most of your growth, like say 70, 80%?

Timothy Davis (00:08:47):
I always say, where are your users? You will have some data that will allow you to understand that say right now, you're doing really well on TikTok. Some would argue that's an emerging channel right now. Great. If that's doing really well for you, maybe you take... Because that content could be used on something similar like Snap, see how that does for you. You could also lean into your Google Analytics or whatever analytics tool you are using and see if you're already getting users from that platform. If you're currently managing that, if you don't have a profile on there and obviously, you don't have a presence, it would be really hard for users to find you and get there. But always look at the data that's available to you within your analytics platforms and say, "Users are already finding us here. How can we turn that knob up to 11?" And you can do that with paid. Because if they're already finding you through that channel, what would happen if you were to just turn it up to 11?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
Is there an example of a company you worked with that's known that as an example of that, where you're like, "Oh, I see everyone's looking, finding them on Google. Let's go turn it to 11."

Timothy Davis (00:09:55):
Yeah. So there was a company I worked with a couple of years ago called, Hairstory and IPSY. I know, very funny. Guy with no hair working on a company called Hairstory, but they were doing really well from a Google shopping standpoint. But when I started consulting with them, we looked at the analytics and we actually saw that they were getting a lot of people from Meta and TikTok at the time. And TikTok was very, very new and they didn't really know what to do with it. So said, "We'll do a small test." We can start on Meta with just some customer testimonials. Let's see how that does. We'll get interest in, build a funnel, get retargeting, and hopefully get conversions. TikTok was so new at the time that it was like, "We don't know what's going to work. Let's just try with what is currently available."

(00:10:47):
Then once we started doing it, we started noticing, "Hey, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a creative standpoint." We were missing the mark of what we were using on Meta was working, was not working on TikTok. So you can't always just take what is currently working on one platform and apply it to another because it is a different user experience. It is a different mindset that the user has when they're on there. So that was an example of where we were able to take those instances, look at their data and say, "They're already finding us here. How can we turn this up a little bit?" And I don't remember the numbers exactly, but it was pretty exponential.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:24):
Okay. So the core advice here so far, is look for where people are coming to you from today, and then that gives you a sign of where you should start to think about running paid ads, performance marketing on those platforms.

Timothy Davis (00:11:38):
Yeah. And also, there's a saying that my current director likes to use, which is signs of life. You can always do a very, very small test. You can just put a little money into a platform, see if there's a sign of life. If there is, then you can pull back and say, "Okay, we have signs of life. Now let's build a campaign around that." There's no reason to say, "All right, we have a signs of life. Let's now turn it up all the way." Do we have the right creative? Do we have the right campaign? Do we have the right messaging for the users on this platform? Then let's take that approach, as opposed to just, "Hey, signs of life, great, go run a hundred miles an hour." Make sure you're doing the right thing when you get into those platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Let's follow that thread. A lot of people run little experiments on say, TikTok, and Snap, and Twitter, and things like LinkedIn, and they often don't see a lot of results and it's always like, "Hey, did we do it wrong or is it the platform's not working?" I know it's a very difficult question to give like, "Here's how you do a sign of life test correctly," But what are some things that you think either people do often wrong when they're trying to experiment with the platform or that you just think they should do when they're trying to look for signs of life?

Timothy Davis (00:12:49):
The number one thing I tell people all the time is use your own data, start with your own data. So take the existing customer base you have, load that up into the platform to build lookalikes. From there, you can do... And I'll use Meta as the example. You can do a 1%, all the way up to a 10%. So 1% match, 2%, 3%, so on and so forth.

(00:13:12):
What I tend to do is build ad sets, one at 1% because we know that one's going to be highly correlated to what we're looking for. Then a two to four, and then a five to seven, and then an eight plus. More times than not, the eight plus does not work, but there have been times where it has, so it's, "Hey, let's do it. Let's try it." But if you also have a very limited budget because some people don't have the luxury of having an unlimited budget like we do in some of these other companies I've worked at, just start with the 1%. See what that sign of life is because you already know that this is so tied to your existing customer base. If that sign of life is giving you a positive signal, now you have the information you need to build a campaign you need to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:02):
What are these percentages referring to? You may have mentioned it, but when you say 1%, 2%, 3%.

Timothy Davis (00:14:07):
Yeah, yeah. So that is how closely tied they are to that user's behavior on the platform. So they're 1% tied to what they're doing. They're visiting similar pages or they have similar behavior on the platform, so they're more than likely going to be tied to what that user... They're not going to be that user exactly, but they're going to be very correlated to them where 10% is pretty wide base that you're going to hit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:35):
I see. So the smaller the percentage, the closer they are, the closer it will look like there.

Timothy Davis (00:14:39):
Yep, there you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):
How do you know if it's the creative that is failing versus it's just never going to work? Is there something that tells you that's what's not working?

Timothy Davis (00:14:47):
It's a million-dollar question, to be honest with you. Because you could look at some of the metrics that currently exist in the platform. Click-through rate basically just tells you, are the users engaged? Because start with the target. You're getting the impressions are there. Is the target right? That should be your first thing. Yes, the target is correct. Users that we want to see are seeing our ads, but they're not engaging with it. That would be the first thing.

(00:15:15):
But the part that I think you're really trying to ask is creative versus the content. Because sometimes depending on the ad unit, you could have a story creative that is literally the creative has to stand on its own, not necessarily the content that's in it, but something like an in-feed creative has a headline, a primary, a description, and a creative. That's where honestly, the only way you're going to get an answer to that outside of the data that's available to you like click-through rate, reach, frequency and all those things to pull in more metrics, is a focus group to understand, "Hey, when you saw this image with this content, what was your result from it?"

(00:15:58):
Now, you can build a test within the platform to do a control versus a test where say, you take the creative with the same primary and the same description versus a creative that's just your logo with the headline and the description and see what the results are. But more times than not, you're not getting the understanding from the user of, well, why doesn't that creative resonate with you? And they'll give you suggestions in the focus group. Why does that work better for you than not? So that's a really, really hard question to answer without having those dialogue with the user to understand that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. How long do you recommend these tests run for these signs of life tests? And I like this term, by the way. I haven't heard this before.

Timothy Davis (00:16:40):
Ideally, in a perfect world, you're going to hear the word, statistical relevance. Mathematicians will tell you exactly what that number is. And I'm not going to pretend like a mathematician, but a lot of times, it's budget constraint. So there could be a VP finance. Anyone like that could just come to you and just say, "Hey, do you have $25,000 for this test?" You only have 5,000. Just get that information, get that data. You can then also build an off size off of that. Hey guys, we worked with our Meta partners, we worked with our Google partners. We put $1,000 behind this test. We know that our impression share was this, our reach was this. If we were to put $10,000 into it, this is the expected return we can get from it based on the click-through rate, the conversion rate that we got from the test that we ran.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:34):
Got it. So basically, we have limited number of dollars to spend. That'll tell you how long you could run one of these for.

Timothy Davis (00:17:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:42):
Any other tips for someone that's trying to experiment with a platform early on for these signs of life tests? So one is try a lookalike that is the most targeted version of the lookalike. So 1% you said, and then incrementally grown and incrementally increase that percentage as you spend more. Any other tips, I guess, for people just to experiment with the platform?

Timothy Davis (00:18:04):
Make sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. A lot of times, companies I've either consulted with or worked at, there was always pressure or there was always a need to succeed at whatever experiment we put into market. I believe in creating an environment where it's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning. And more times than not, if we put something new into a platform that we know nothing about, we're learning the bells and whistles, we're learning the functionality of it. Just know there's going to be things you're not going to understand because each platform is unique, each platform is different, the user behavior is different. So give yourself some grace, understand that this may not work. And as long as you're learning from it, you're going to be okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:56):
I love that. In terms of which platforms people should explore, obviously there's Google, there's Facebook, Instagram, what are the platforms people should seriously consider at this point?

Timothy Davis (00:19:09):
Google for sure. And when we say Google, let's make sure everyone understands what Google entails. Google is YouTube, Google is Google search, GDN, Google Display Network. There's a lot of things in Google that you can do. I always say, if you have the creative available, you should really, really be looking at doing video because video is one of those things that I'm very bullish on. It is doing really well when you measure it the right way. And as long as you can get that creative and get it consistently just because you have one piece of creative, if it's doing well, you do need to have that creative refresh, kind of that flywheel going. Make sure you're doing Google Search, again, user-driven, YouTube, and Meta, and Meta contains both Facebook and Instagram. And then based on the data available to you, if you do see users on TikTok, definitely go after those. But if you're just starting out and you just want to get your feet wet into something, I would say start with Google Search, then get into Meta. And if you have video available, definitely get into YouTube.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):
Awesome. Okay. So Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. What about LinkedIn? Do you see things happening there for say, B2B companies?

Timothy Davis (00:20:30):
Yeah. LinkedIn is very expensive in comparison. So just know if you're going into LinkedIn, it's going to look almost three times more expensive than other channels. The targeting that's available on LinkedIn, knowing job titles, industries, actually targeting people at certain companies is very powerful. The example I always tend to use is that I worked at a company called SoftLayer. SoftLayer was acquired by IBM because they were trying to build out their cloud portfolio, couldn't do it. So they're like, "Hey, let's do the next best thing and buy this company." But when we were just SoftLayer, we were trying to get Coca-Cola as one of our clients. And you know those Coke freestyles where you can pick whatever drink you want and put the flavor in it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:21):
No, that's awesome.

Timothy Davis (00:21:22):
Oh man, these are great. Maybe it's a cell thing, but basically, you go up to a Coke freestyle and say, "I want Dr. Pepper and I want cherry flavor in it." Or you want Coke Zero with cherry and vanilla in it, you can do that. It's the freestyle you get to pick. The reason they wanted it to be cloud-based is because there's a ton of drinks in there. So you need to be able to efficiently and effectively say, "This store needs more Sprite or this store needs more Sprite Zero." Because you have your whole portfolio in this one machine, so you want to be able to update things more readily. And it was between us, AWS and Microsoft. And met with the sales team and said, "What do we need to do to win this?" Because it was a big ticket item for us.

(00:22:14):
And what we found out was they had two concerns about us. It was recency and private security. So what we did was we found out where the decision makers were. So A, in LinkedIn, we took the anyone who works at Coca-Cola, we want you to see ads about security and recency. Outside of that, we also geo-fenced it because you would think Coca-Cola Atlanta, that's where the decision maker sits, but they were actually in LA. So in LA, we geo-fenced them, and we knew that they worked at Coca-Cola. The next time the salesperson got on the call with the team to say, "Hey, just wanted to check in." He was like, "Hey, hey, I get it. Security is fine. Recency is fine. We hear you." That was great to hear because it was something we were able to do on LinkedIn and we did it in other platforms as well. But we knew we were able to get not only to the decision maker, but everyone around that decision maker to say, "Hey, these guys may be the ones we need to go with."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):
Okay. So just to mirror back what you're saying, you're saying you ran ads on LinkedIn targeting the execs at Coca-Cola, trying to influence them to overcome these barriers they had to buying to working with you guys. Amazing. I've seen people do that on Google Search, but I've never heard of... It makes so much sense to do on LinkedIn and it worked. And did they know that you did this or they're just like, "Oh, I just changed my mind"?

Timothy Davis (00:23:42):
One of them was like, "We get it. We're seeing it everywhere." We actually tried because at the time, we didn't have an offline team. We actually tried to buy the billboards around the office as well, but I didn't know enough at the time from an offline perspective of the right people to talk to, how long it would take to do it. So we were trying to pour it on hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):
That's incredible. I could see why LinkedIn is more expensive. That's incredibly powerful. And is the advice then that LinkedIn makes more sense for higher LTV, higher CB type of products?

Timothy Davis (00:24:15):
Yeah, exactly. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn and my LinkedIn reps may kill me for this. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn until you've tested Google and Meta first. Now, you could be an enterprise level company and it does make sense to start with LinkedIn for sure, but depending on your audience, I would say more times than not, it would be a Google, Meta discussion before going to LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
Okay. So just generally, start with Google and Meta. Is there one or the other usually? I guess, yeah, which one would you start with if you had to pick one?

Timothy Davis (00:24:49):
Always Google Search. I'm always going to say, start with Google search, but it's also creative dependent. If you don't have the right creative for Facebook, it's going to be really hard to convert because users are just going to either be turned off by what you're putting out there. And then also, depending on where your user base is. If they're not on Facebook, it's kind of a moot point. But if they're browsing around on GDN or YouTube, it makes more sense to go there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):
And then you said this insight about video is performing super well right now and you're recommending people use video. And the key there is you need to be able to make videos, video ads.

Timothy Davis (00:25:25):
Yeah. You got to make sure you have that flywheel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):
And the flywheel is just people internally or some company agency that can make video ads for you?

Timothy Davis (00:25:32):
Correct. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:33):
Cool. I guess, is there any advice there of just how to do that or what ads work well or anything there for someone else-

Timothy Davis (00:25:39):
So yeah. The thing with YouTube is I always say, start with emotion. If you can have an emotional connection with the user, is going to be way more impactful and way more powerful than anything else. And to take that further, when I say emotion, I'm talking about comedy, I'm talking about...

Timothy Davis (00:26:00):
I'm talking about happiness. It's not necessarily just, "Oh, we need an emotional connection with the brand." It is just making sure the user feels something after seeing your ad. Because then, they're more times not going to remember it, which then they will take a favorable action after the fact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
That is super interesting. One last question about platforms. Are there any other platforms you see working for people that are emerging maybe that people aren't thinking about, Reddit, or Snap, or X, or I don't know, anything along those lines?

Timothy Davis (00:26:34):
When you say emerging channels, my brain kind of goes to connected TV, podcast, VR, advertising, audio/voice search, and even AI stuff right now. I can tell you podcasts are doing really well for the people that I know are able to measure it correctly. Connected TV is also doing really well. You can take the, again, you're doing YouTube right now, being able to take that creative and repurpose it. But the VR stuff and the AI stuff, that is stuff that is, I would say, very emerging right now. Because to be completely transparent, I haven't experimented with those things yet. I kind of like letting other people be the guinea pig and learning from them, and then if someone comes to me and they're like, "Hey, we have budget for this, let's go ahead and test it." "Great. Let's go. Let's see what we can learn."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:34):
Awesome. Podcast ads. I'm glad you suggested that. I'm a huge fan. Thank you. They're working really well for a lot of our sponsors and I'm very biased, so you don't need to pay attention to me. But I also think there's a lot of opportunity there. Okay. Let's talk about when to start investing in performance marketing/paid growth. So, say, you're a startup, do you have any advice for when it's time to start, signs of life test or even... And then also, just when is it time to scale to go like, "Okay, let's go big on this."

Timothy Davis (00:28:08):
If you are a startup, typically, whenever I consulted with them, it was what are the goals, what are we trying to achieve, and when? Because if you're looking for something quick, paid needs to start immediate. And paid [inaudible 00:28:24] started yesterday because SEO takes time. SEO, depending on the market you're getting into, if it's emerging, people may not even know your product exists. There was a product I was working on years ago that if you were traveling to a hotel, and say, it was a romantic getaway with you and your partner. And you wanted the hotel suite or room done up with flower petals, and champagne, and stuff like that, they would do it for you. Well, they were working with someone before that was like, "Oh, we should totally be in paid search." And if you look at the keywords that they were doing, it was like, booking hotel rooms. It's like, "No, that's complete disconnect." And they're like, "Yeah, but we're trying to build awareness."

(00:29:08):
You don't want to build awareness through search. You build awareness through display media-based type media. When we transitioned all of their money over at the time, and this will age me, before Meta was a thing, when we transitioned everything over to GDN, that's when the company started really reaping the rewards. Because we were building the awareness around the product. So, it depends on what is the demand of your product and market. If you're doing something that is similar to another product and market, you could do competitor, I call it coattail riding. Say, Lenny, you and I create a product that is similar to monday.com. We can go out there and just start bidding on monday.com and say, "See why Lenny and Tim are better than monday.com." And start getting some people in interested, maybe kicking the tires, starting free trials, but they also have other keywords that they can go after in market. But if you're going after something new like hotel room, flowers, and I forget what keywords we were bidding on for that, it was years ago. People weren't thinking of that. It wasn't something they were searching for. So, it just really depends on, A, when do you expect results because SEO can take time. And B, what is the demand in the market for your product?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:33):
Some people use paid ads to drive early growth to bring customers, to help them figure out what to build kind of pre-product market fit growth. Is that something you recommend? Is that something you'd advise against? Is that strategy that you've seen work?

Timothy Davis (00:30:48):
Yeah. Product market fit is a huge thing. We've run into some of this at Shopify, and we definitely ran into this at IBM. So, for the longest time, IBM is, "We're a global company, we should be everywhere." But when we started looking at the data, it was, "Should we be everywhere?" For example, Africa, we were in the whole continent. We weren't just in, say, South Africa, or Egypt, or something like that. And the more we dug into it, the more we realized the biggest issue wasn't necessarily that users weren't interested in our product and weren't purchasing it, it was because we didn't have a product market fit mainly from an operation standpoint.

(00:31:33):
In Africa, there are multitudes of different types of currency. There's the franc, there's the rand, there's the shill, and we were just, "Hey, USD, thank you." So, of course, they weren't converting unless they were going out of their way to make a way to convert that. So, when we took a step back and we said, "Okay, where do we want to start?" It was South Africa. That's really where we were trying to get, quote, unquote, "stronghold" in, so we had to make sure we had the rand available. Once we did that, we started doing tremendously better because we had a product market fit. They had demand for our product, and now we were able to serve them, meet them where they were.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
So essentially, you're saying probably not smart to run a bunch of ads if it's not working, if you don't have something people actually want yet in that market?

Timothy Davis (00:32:28):
Right. Or able to convert.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:31):
Because conversion is going to end up being really low, no one actually cares about what you're doing.

Timothy Davis (00:32:35):
All you're going to do is really annoy the users. Because, say, in the future they are, "Hey, I'm still interested, but I don't want to use that product because I already tried." It's like, "No, no, you can totally use it now." "I already tried. I had a bad experience with them." And some users will hold you accountable to that. One bad experience and I'm just never giving you my business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):
Interesting. So, is that generally your advice if you're startup, you're not feeling like you actually have product market fit yet, should you even experiment with and do signs of life tests, or should you hold off until it's like, "Okay, it's actually working, let's go."

Timothy Davis (00:33:10):
From an operation standpoint, I always want to make sure those things are tied off. Yeah, it doesn't make sense to, again, if you have a major budget and you're trying to get awareness into a market, great, yeah, you can go after a market. But just know that it's probably not going to convert very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:28):
Got it. So-

Timothy Davis (00:33:29):
I wouldn't recommend it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:31):
Okay, great. Awesome. Very clear answer. Let's talk about the mistakes that you see companies make when they're investing in performance marketing. We got introduced through Casey Winters's illustrious former podcast guest, two-time podcast guest and asked them about you. And he told me that when you take over for an agency at a company that you've worked with, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you see and find they are doing wrong that allows you to be such a hero when you come in and take over.

Timothy Davis (00:34:03):
I think agencies have playbooks. Now I've worked at agencies, I did consulting for a long period of time and it was never an approach I took. I looked at each account and each company as its own thing. But I think a lot of agencies just come in and they go, "Oh, this is like AB&C company. And this is what we're doing. Copy, paste, done, move on." And they're also not willing to get deep, deep, deep into the weeds of stuff. I may get a little too far into data than some other people. For example, I have ops cadence that myself and my team follow. So, within that ops cadence, we have things like finance, performance, structure, keywords, ad copy, quality score, targeting, et cetera, et cetera. And then, within each of those we have specifics. For example, the keyword subsection is keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negative, so on so forth.

(00:35:06):
I feel like agencies don't necessarily get into all of those things every single month where some of those we're doing weekly, some of those we're doing biweekly, and some of those we're doing monthly. But they touch the things that they think they need to touch. They turn on automated bidding, they're doing their search query reports, and then they just kind of move on with their day because they have 50 other clients they have to get to. Well, what about looking at your conversions? Where are we converting? Have we tested different landing pages? What is a better user experience that we could be getting users right now? It's a five-step process, can we get it to a three? Partnering with PMMs to say, "Hey, here's something that I think could help improve our lead to conversion." Just stuff like that, that they're too busy with too many other things to focus really, really deep into those.

(00:36:03):
And typically, whenever I managed an agency in the past and I consulted, I made sure that you weren't stretched thin enough that you couldn't do those things. Because I'm a firm believer in hiring smart people and then getting out of their way. But each week having one-on-ones with them, just spot checking things, just saying, "Hey, I looked at this. This doesn't look right. What's going on there?" "Oh yeah, I do that on this day." "Okay, great. Just making sure you're covered." Because sometimes people won't scream uncle when they should be screaming uncle because they think it's a sign of weakness.

(00:36:40):
But let me know when you're overwhelmed. Maybe I have a solution for you. Maybe there's a way I can coach you to be better at something, or we just need to hire more resources. Because the client portfolio you have is five, and when we took them on, they were all at 100K, but now they're all spending 2 million plus. We need to offload some of that from you because you're doing such a good job that you've scaled them up. Let's give you three clients instead of five and hire someone to take those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):
So it sounds like basically they just don't have the time to care and spend on all the things that they need to be doing. And when you've held companies, you actually go deep and you have the time to do it well. I guess, when someone's trying to find an agency or someone like you, I know you don't do this much anymore. Any advice for just how to know if they're going to be great? Is it just agencies in general probably not a good choice? Is it hire someone in-house? I guess, what advice do you offer people that are like, "Oh man, I want to avoid this."

Timothy Davis (00:37:43):
Agencies are a good place to get things started. Even when I was consulting, I would, honestly, I'm a big believer in forward thinking, backwards planning. So, if I'm taking this contract on with this new client, what's the end goal for you? If your end goal is to have this at performing in $100 million spend, there's no way one person can do that. So let's create milestones along the way of making sure we're checking in and saying, when is the right time to hire? Whether that's a data scientist, whether that's a creative person in-house or replacing me full time. There's no reason that you should be holding a company back. If anything, you should be helping them get to that milestone. And I think that's why I've been able to do so well for myself because I show that, "Hey, I have the best interest for you and your company." As opposed to how much more money can I squeeze from you by holding onto you as a client.

(00:38:47):
I would say, agency consultant is a good way to start. Because if you as a business owner, you shouldn't have to log into, "Oh, I haven't logged into Google in three weeks to look at stuff because I'm doing payroll, I'm doing HR stuff, and I'm meeting with clients, and I'm doing sales." Start there, get it to a good place. Create that milestone of, "Hey, when we're spending 50K a month, I need to hire somebody full time to take this over." And just have that conversation with your agency and your consultant. I think more times than not, you will have a positive reaction to that. But if you don't, I would say that's a major red flag and probably someone you shouldn't be partnering with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):
Awesome. Okay, so your advice is to get started on paid growth, buying an agency or a small shop consultant type person to get you started, have a conversation. And when we reach a certain scale, we're going to hire someone internally to run this for us. And then, potentially, they'll keep working with you. Potentially they'll start things in their own. Or is the assumption they'll start working with you, they'll become the owner of this thing, or is it like we may transition you out?

Timothy Davis (00:39:52):
That's a really good point actually. So, there have been times where a client's like, "Hey, we've reached our milestone. I want to bring someone in." That person comes in, and say, they're an expert in social media, like, "Hey, I still want you to execute on Google and Bing, because that is just not my bailiwick. I'll take over the social stuff, but we do need to talk about your fee. Maybe it does need to go down." "Completely acceptable. Let's have that discussion, make sure we're both aligned to what that should be." But yeah, there have been times where they're like, "Hey, we've reached our milestone. We got to bring someone on." But that person that they bring on is like, "Actually, I see expansion in this direction, but I can't do this. Are you willing to stay on, and help me with this? Great. If not, I'll just have to find someone else who can."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:37):
I want to talk about the team that you build over time, but later. But specifically, for this first person that you hire, what sort of person is this person? Is it like a data person? Is it a person that's just done specific performance marketing on channel? Or what do you look for ideally?

Timothy Davis (00:40:55):
I'm a big believer in... There was a book written by Nate Silver called The Signal and the Noise. Are you familiar with it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):
No.

Timothy Davis (00:41:07):
So, Nate Silver is the guy who created.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):
FiveThirtySeven?

Timothy Davis (00:41:12):
Yeah, yeah. And in the book, he basically... I'm going to use the word art, I'm going to use the word art, detailed the art of probability statistics and applied him to real world circumstances. It included case studies with baseball, which of course I loved. Elections, climate change, poker, stuff like that. And I liked that book. It's kind of dense. But the thing I liked the most about it was the title. And just changing the title ever so slightly to signal not noise. So typically, whenever I hire people, I want to hire smart people and kind of get out of their way. But the biggest thing I want to focus on is what is your thought process when it comes to data?

(00:42:05):
Because I can teach anyone how to do Google ads. I can teach anyone how to do Meta ads. That is not the hard part. It is the data part that is the hard part because there is so much noise going on in those accounts. They give you everything, which is great. It's great that they give you all this information, but you can have someone that's "Oh, but look at the reach, look at the frequency, look at the CPMs, look at the CPC, look at the conversion rate. Look at the cost per lead. Look at the cost per MQL. Look at this." Hold on, that's a lot of noise you just said. So what is the signal and what is the noise? And let's make sure we're focusing on the right signal versus the right noise. And that has to be a data person because there's a lot of data in these platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:51):
\This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:43:43):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's get E-P-P-O .com/lenny.

(00:44:10):
Everyone I talked to that's worked with you is just like, "Timothy is incredible at working with tons of data and finding the things that matter." Someone told me that it actually comes from your love of baseball, that you just go crazy with stats and spreadsheets of baseball games, and players, and things like that. Is there something there that you could share that is interesting?

Timothy Davis (00:44:28):
Yeah. So I played baseball my whole life, but when you blow out your arm and you're as fast as a sea otter, it's not very conducive for you to continue chasing that dream. But the one thing I always liked was the stats. Even as a kid when I would watch baseball games on TV, it's like, what's this guy batting? How often is he getting on base? How many RBIs? Like, "Oh, this guy is terrible average, but he has a lot of RBIs, so that means if there's a runner on base, he may not get a hit, but he's going to get that guy in. So you want to make sure you put him in the right spot in the batting order, so on and so forth." I could talk about that for hours. But again, that could be another thing where there's a lot of data available, which one should you focus on?

(00:45:16):
And ultimately, what is the optimization you're going to make to the lineup or to where you place fielders on the field to ensure that we're doing the right thing and becoming as efficient and effective as possible? As far as dealing with all that data, that is just, I would say, a skill I've learned over time. Early in my career, whenever someone was like, "Oh, we have this new project. Who wants to work on it?" "I'll do it." I was always just eager like a sponge. I wanted to get in as much stuff as possible. I did SEO for a portion of my career. I did email marketing. I did affiliates. And then, eventually, I remember the first time I saw paid, because again, I was doing SEO where I was like, "Yeah, we're going to do this and we think it's going to work." But we won't know for about six months.

(00:46:12):
Someone showed me the paid platform. I was like, "Wait, you know this is the keyword you're bidding on. This is how many times the ad was shown, how many people clicked on it? How many... Wow, this is amazing. I need to get more into this." And that's just kind of where it started. And when I usually hire people and we go through the interview process, I make sure that they can be data focused. Really, it's just ensuring that we're focusing on that signal and not the noise. And one of the interview questions I usually ask is I throw a bunch of data points at them and then say, "Out of all that, what would you do to optimize the account?" And more times than not that they're just overwhelmed. But the people that I like are like, " Well, what's the purpose of the campaign?"

(00:47:02):
"The purpose of the campaign is to drive conversions." "Okay, well, I would focus here, focus on how many clicks we're getting, and how many conversions, are we targeting the right people?" Because who cares about how many impressions you're getting? Who cares about the reach? Who cares about the frequency? If the goal of the campaign is to get the conversions, that's what we should be doing. If it was awareness, it's how many people saw it. If it was a consideration, how many people were getting into the funnel and are considering us from a white paper download or a demo as the product solution that they're looking for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
That's a great segue to the next question I wanted to ask you, which is just metrics that you love to focus on, pay attention to when you're helping people with paid ads. A lot of people think about CAC, a lot of people think about return on ad spend, LTV to CAC. I know it really depends on the goals as you said, but I guess, is there anything that you find is like, forget these metrics, these are kind of the bucket that you focus on most?

Timothy Davis (00:48:01):
Yeah, so for those metrics, I would say, I really hope you have a great finance partner. Shout out to Courtney and Nick the fantastic finance partners I have at Shopify. Nick's not there anymore. Sad cry emoji. But Courtney, we're able to collaborate on those things. Understand, this is the investment we're putting in, this is the expected return, this is the CAC that we can basically put a guardrail on. You have to be within. So, hopefully you have a really strong financial partner you can use for those. But as far as the stuff that I focus on, there are things that whenever we're looking at accounts, we'll kind of hyperfocus on. For example, Google will give you information about what is going on with your ad copy and how to ultimately show as often as possible. What I'm showing here is a visual of brand versus non-brand when it comes to expected click-through rate, landing page experience, and ad relevance.

(00:49:08):
The reason I like building reports like this is because it'll kind of show you where your hole in the ship is. If you look on the left side expected click-through rate, 75% above average. Landing page experience, 84% above average. Then you get down to ad relevance, a lot more colors than there are green, only 35% above average. So, for your brand ad copy, the clear direction you have from the data that's available to you is jump into the account and make it more relevant. That will improve your ad strength. And once you improve your ad strength, that will improve your quality score. And more times than, I think, it's a 12% increase in the number of impressions you can get if you increase from a below average to an above average for the data that's available here. And then, on the non-brand side, clear expected click-through rate, you really need to be working on.

(00:50:13):
And that data is also available here that you can kind of see. I put in red the one for brand, your quality score being at a nine, but your average CPC is $8. That is very interesting. It should be, the higher your CPC is, the lower your CPC should be. So that is an investigation that's like, "Hey, here's a signal, let's go do a deep dive." So there's further reports that you could look at. Looking at the ad strength again, average, excellent, good, or poor. You can see clearly on the non-brand side doing really well. They're doing really well here. Most of their ads, 46 of their ads are excellent and a bulk of their spend is going there. But if we look on the brand side, you have one ad, one ad that you could go in and just click pause on, that is a poor. And look at that CPC $7.

(00:51:19):
So just turning that ad off by itself, not only will... I'm a firm believer in that there's an account level quality score, not just necessarily a keyword or an ad quality score. So, just turning this one off and removing it from the account, this one ad could dramatically improve your performance. And then, Google actually tells you what you need to do to increase those strength things. So this report is ultimately powered by this one. So for your ad strength improvements, they'll tell you, "Try adding a few more unique headlines or unpinning some of the ad sets. Try including more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines." So-

Timothy Davis (00:52:00):
Including more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines. So they're actually giving you this information, but more times than not, I just feel like people are just missing this and just not taking action on it. So definitely some stuff available within the account that will help you focus on that signal versus the noise that you could be just getting from the clicks, the impressions and all those things that are available to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):
That was amazing. For folks not watching on YouTube, you pulled up actual reports from, I think, imagine, past clients, is that what the data was from?

Timothy Davis (00:52:24):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:32):
Okay, so actual reports from past clients of how you evaluate, and this is Google Ads, basically.

Timothy Davis (00:52:38):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):
Google Ads data. Incredible. Okay. And so within those reports, you had poor, excellent. How do you determine when something is going great? Is that something you set, like if it's above this threshold? Is that a benchmark you have, or is that Google telling you, "This is poor, or this..."

Timothy Davis (00:52:54):
Yeah, so that's Google telling you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:56):
Okay.

Timothy Davis (00:52:57):
There's sometimes where you'll work really, really hard to take that poor to an average, that average to an excellent, and there's just not a whole lot you can do sometimes. It kind of is what it is. But I would argue more times than not, people are not doing those things to improve their ad strength. So just if you have the change history available in every account, in Meta, in Google, if people are doing the test to try and improve and get better, great. You have the right people working. But if not, that's a clear indication that there's definitely room for improvement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:40):
Something that someone asked on Twitter is for benchmarks around any of the stuff. How do you know when your CPC is good? I guess you just look at... Do you look at Google telling you it's excellent versus poor? How do you know if your conversion rate is good? How do you know if your CAC is good?

Timothy Davis (00:53:54):
Yeah, every industry and every company is going to be different, healthcare, lawyers, those are some of the highest cost and average CPCs I've seen. If I was to compare that industry, say to a B2B industry, it would not be very good at all. Honestly, what I would tell the user to do, every single platform has partners available, more times than not, they're kind of like salespeople. I actually really like the partners that we have at Shopify, because I do feel that they are partners. Shout out to Francisco at Google, and Sami and Alana at Meta. And Nick, and Sam, and Brian at LinkedIn, in case they all hear this. But I think they're really great partners, and they will give you that information.

(00:54:44):
They will actually say, "If you give me the five people you consider to be your top competitors, I will tell you if you are above or below a certain threshold." Now they can't tell you CAC because they would have to have transparency into conversions. But click-through rate, conversion rate, cost per click, things like that, they will give you that information because they will anonymize it, so you won't know who is who. If you say, "My competitor's monday.com," they won't say, "monday.com has a click-through rate of 5%." They won't tell you that. But they will tell you, "Of the competitors you gave us, and we added three more in just to say, hey, we found some people." And also to where if you only give them two, you can be like, "Oh, it's one or the other." That they'll give you that information because they want you to succeed. Because if you succeed, you spend more money on their platform.

(00:55:38):
So if you find out your average CPC is really high, take the actions that are in the account that tell you what you can do to lower it. But if you find out that you have a lower CPC, you're like, "Oh, great, I thought that was worse." And then you can communicate that internally to your team and say, "Hey, our average CPCs may seem high, but in reality we got with our partners, and we are on par with the industry."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:02):
Got it. So the advice is, don't seek generic benchmarks for any of these metrics. You can talk to your rep at Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera. And they'll give you essentially the numbers-

Timothy Davis (00:56:13):
Great summary. Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:14):
Amazing. Okay, going back to the report you just showed, is that a report you developed custom that gives you, here's the most important stuff to pay attention to? Or is it basically an export from Google Ad Manager, and...

Timothy Davis (00:56:26):
So these are all exports, so that this is just the visualization of the data that's available. So this all data is available in every account. This is data available in the account, this is data available in the account. Now in saying that, there are more reports that we get into, like impression sharing frequency. This is something I tend to look at, that not a lot of other people do. It's not about showing as often as possible because that's what impression share tells you, and that's kind of like ego marketing. I want to be number one, I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.

(00:57:06):
Instead of thinking about being on top of the page, you should think about serving the right user, which can be measured with our click share. And then Google will put us on top of the page, which we can see through our top impression share. That's what this whole visualization is here for, where I feel like a lot of people don't do this type of visualization. And this can be done by leveraging all the user data available on Google, such as demographics, locations, if any audiences, in-market audiences. Testing different bid strategies and more.

(00:57:40):
So the data's readily available, but it's just making the visualization a little bit more digestible. And the reason that I actually have two here to show is because this is an example of when I was working on an account back in 2023, where we started making some changes. And you can see that, clearly, our impression share, I would say was baseline. It didn't really change too much, but look at our click share going up. Because now again, we're talking more to the right people, not necessarily just everyone, generic people. Versus this campaign that was... This was the test and this was the control, and you can clearly see that we were talking to a lot of people, but no one cared about what we were talking about. So this was an easy test to call and just say, "This one's performing a lot better." And then verifying the other metrics still look good, conversion rate, number of conversions, stuff like that. This one was the clear winner, so we went in this direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
This is super cool. I love that you're showing this. And again, plug for YouTube to actually see the charts you're talking about. I see one more slide on this deck. I'm curious, what's there?

Timothy Davis (00:58:49):
Yeah, so this one, I'm hoping you have show notes that we can give a shout-out to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Timothy Davis (00:58:56):
Yep. There's a website called PPC Hero. What I usually tell people is, "Terrible name, great content." The actual website used to be a little bit more cartoonish with superheroes on it, but now it's, they've refined it. But the writer there, his name's Jacob Brown. This is what he calls the true competition metric. And again, this is why I highly recommend we give people the link to the article because this does get a little dense. So what he does is that he creates four new metrics with the Auction Insights that are available. And two of those metrics are position above rate when we show, and amount of times they show and we don't. Added together, and it will show how often a competitor ranks above you in all auctions you're available for. Using this type of lens is an effective way to identify genuine threats.

(00:59:56):
Not that just, this data can be used to gain comprehensive insights like determining your position and impression share, but by creating a baseline that you can see how this data changes over time through different bid strategies, keyword ad copy optimizations and more. This is a very, very powerful one, because I do know a lot of people are always concerned about, "What are my competitors doing? How are they doing it? Why are they doing it?" And with all the smart bidding currently available...

(01:00:25):
Back in my day, it was all manual bid, so you could change the bid ever so slightly, and then be like, "Oh, now my competitor's showing above me," and this is even before Google gave us Auction Insights data. This is now available to us in the platform. Using this report will actually identify a true threat, as opposed to making an assumption based on personalization that maybe you're seeing when you Google a keyword, or using a tool like Semrush that ultimately is saying, "Oh, this person's appearing above you. Well, let's run this report and see if it's a genuine threat," as opposed to just maybe ego marketing going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:09):
Super cool. And this comes from PPC Hero, is this what you're saying?

Timothy Davis (01:01:13):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:13):
Cool. We'll definitely link to that. Are there any other tools or workflows that you find really helpful in analyzing this endless amount of data?

Timothy Davis (01:01:24):
Please, audience, if you are using AI in this way, let me know because a lot of this stuff I do can be a little manual and can be a little time-consuming. If they've found ways to automate through AI where I can provide the information that isn't sensitive, that they will make it a lot cleaner, and a lot more digestible, let me know. But a lot of the things, I have templates that you can load the data into, and it will just automatically give you the result from it. But yeah, right now, it is a little manual, but if there's a way to automate this through AI, please, users, contact me on LinkedIn and let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):
Sounds like a startup opportunity right there.

Timothy Davis (01:02:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Sweet. Okay, let's move in a slightly different direction. Attribution, what a sexy, exciting topic. So attribution, basically it's how do you assign credit to a channel and to a campaign, so that you know where growth is coming from, what's working? What's the state of attribution today? What do you find is helpful? How do people do attribution well in today's world?

Timothy Davis (01:02:35):
Yeah, I'm a big believer and proponent in multi-touch. I fall into the camp of more time decay. Historically, the research I've done, users tend to forget very quickly where they first found your brand. Yes, you should get credit because this is the first time they saw your brand or the first time they interacted with it, for sure, let's give you some credit for that. But definitely not the reason that they ultimately converted. Linear is fine as well, but overall, I do think attribution by itself is biased. It does not answer the question of whether the person clicking on or seeing an ad would've converted anyways, even in the absence of that ad.

(01:03:24):
This is why numerous companies like Netflix and eBay have done studies to get an understanding of the incrementality of paid advertising campaigns, whether that's conducting GeoX or Conversion Lift tests at important slices of the marketing channel. I know eBay was very popular when they did that experiment. I think it was like 2012, and I'll have a link for you for that as well. Where they ultimately decided to cut almost all of their brand spend, because they found that users were already going to find them through organic anyway, so they were just kind of throwing money out the window. And it was really hard for competitors to get their ads at the top of the page because their quality scores were so low.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
Okay, so multi-touch is the way you like to think about it. Basically give credits to all of the channels that you detected the user saw your ad on, and less credit if it was further back in time.

Timothy Davis (01:04:19):
Right, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):
And then in terms of tooling, is there tools you love? Is it stuff you build in-house generally? How do people go about doing this sort of stuff?

Timothy Davis (01:04:28):
Yeah, I don't know if I want to say I have been fortunate or not, but most of the companies I've worked with, like the big companies of the world, the Pinterests, the Shopifys, the IBMs of the world tend to build things in-house. So from a third-party tool, unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot of go-tos for that. So again, either that's a, I've been fortunate or I've been sheltered.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:54):
And then, are there tools that you see people use, or is it just really nothing amazing out there?

Timothy Davis (01:05:00):
Yeah, none that I've seen that's like, "Oh wow, that's amazing." I will always say, make sure you're trying to leverage the in-platform tools because the biggest thing with performance marketing is the signal you're sending the platform. Because if you are telling the platform, "Oh, I want to get more of the users that are doing this action," it's going to do a really good job of giving you that. But if that action doesn't equal business results, you're not helping yourself at the end of the day. You're giving it, again, a lot of noise instead of the right signal. So try and leverage the in-platform tools. Or if there is a tool you're using, make sure it does allow third-party integration through the Google, Meta, TikToks of the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Then let's talk about incrementality. You mentioned this idea of how do you know if the money you spent led to incremental growth that wouldn't have happened if you didn't run that ad. Is there any advice there, anything you've seen about just how to think about incrementality correctly, and not just give yourself all this credit for stuff that would've happened anyway?

Timothy Davis (01:06:09):
Yeah, I mean, there are many ways to judge the effectiveness of growth overall. Like some of the stuff we talked about before, brand metrics, awareness, recall, things along those lines. There are also, I know some companies look at leading indicators like visits, and clicks, or tribute, which of the efforts are linked to or perceived drivers of actions. Like leads, conversions to prospect, prospect to scale. But really the results should be coming from either that GeoX or Geo experiment or Conversion Lift. The results of those experiments should ultimately fuel the plans for what we call IAF, incrementality adjusted factor, and will allow you to be more precise and how efficient each channel is.

(01:07:03):
Ideally, by region, sometimes you just have a holistic of like, "This is how Meta is, this is how YouTube is." But if you don't have it by region, don't fret, it's fine, just have it by platform. And kind of like what does that look in practice? When you're running a Conversion Lift test, you intentionally do not show your ad to some users when you win an auction, and instead Google shows the next bidders' ad. This is your control group, and adds up to some opportunity costs that is estimated in terms of impression share percentage, as well as spend holdback. Spend holdback is like how much money you will not spend because of this test.

(01:07:42):
And all of the platforms are willing to partner with you on this, because Facebook knows this, LinkedIn knows this. All of them know that they are very visually-based creative assets that are not getting as much credit as they deserve. So if you go to any of them, if say you don't have a dedicated rep you can call, and if you ask for this, more times than not, they are willing to partner with you in saying that, if you're not spending enough, they probably will not help you with this. Because there are certain spend thresholds you do need to meet. But I would say at least start there. And also if you're not spending more than I would say 50K a month in the platform, doing this is going to be a lot more work than you're going to get result from, you're just not going to have enough signal there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
So basically don't worry about running incrementality tests when you're-

Timothy Davis (01:08:39):
Yeah, when you're starting out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):
Got it. Okay. And so basically to understand actual incrementality, every platform has a way for you to actually test it on the platform, and the team there can help you run it.

Timothy Davis (01:08:51):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
Awesome. Okay. Let's go back to talking about team structure and how to build your own performance marketing team. So we talked about the first person that you hire and the advice there was someone that's very, understands how to find signal in noise. So there's that one person, and your advice there was maybe around like 50K. Was that like an actual threshold that you usually recommend, or is that just like an example?

Timothy Davis (01:09:14):
Every business is slightly different. I mean, if they're well funded, 50K may not... the threshold may be higher. But yeah, everyone's different. 50K may be, like if somebody said... If you were to just say, "Hey, give me a number," I would say, "50K to start having those conversations." Because if you're at 50K, say for the month of June, great, it's going to take us three months to hire someone anyway, so at least start the conversations now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):
Awesome. Okay. What do the first three to five hires look like generally, that you recommend for scaling internally from its marketing?

Timothy Davis (01:09:48):
So the first thing, like we said, someone data-driven that can get into the platforms. The next is going to be creative. Because I need those two now working hand-in-hand, making sure the creative is matching the tone and also the performance that we're trying to achieve as a business. And then third would be a dedicated data scientist, a fully dedicated person. Because they can help you with things like the incrementality testing. They can help create reports that will ultimately make everyone's lives better. They will be able to build analyses that as a generalist will not be able to do yourself. There's a saying of like, "I'm not a data scientist, but I like to play one online." Because what they do, they ultimately make us look really good. Because we're ultimately the ones reporting on the performance of it, but they were the ones that helped build that environment, and build all those things for us to succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):
And then in terms of the creative person, is that like a graphic designer? Is it like a marketing person? What's the actual skill set there?

Timothy Davis (01:11:02):
It would be more graphic design/branding. The reason for that is because if you have a good marketing mix, you're going to have... If we keep it to a three-step funnel of awareness, consideration, purchase, you're going to need to build some brand equity in a specific direction. You're going to need to make sure you're communicating value, which now you're not being as creative, you're being more directional. And then ultimately the purchase is like, "Hey, click here, convert now." So you do want to give them the ability to still be creative. "Hey, I hired you because you have a good creative eye and you're good at what you do, but now we need to focus on getting that person to convert." So you give them a little free rein to be creative, but then you also need them to be able to execute against that creative, you need to get those users to convert.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:54):
And they're also writing the copy, I imagine for the Google Ads.

Timothy Davis (01:11:59):
I usually say that should be collaborative. The performance marketer should be able to write most of the ads, but I can't tell you how many times in my career where I've written an ad and I'm like, "This is the greatest ad ever written known to man. People will write stories about this ad, it is amazing." And it flops because I'm not the target audience, more times than not. So I think it should be collaborative, and no idea should be left on the cutting room floor because... Perfect example. I was working with ADT, the security company. We wrote the most perfect ad when Google Ads only allowed a headline and two descriptions of 35 and 35. We got every single value prop in there somehow, it was amazing.

(01:12:50):
And the ad that it was going against was dollar sign, zero setup fee, dollar sign, zero install fee. That ad won. It was like that is... No, how did that... It barely uses any of the characters, and it tells you almost nothing, but it won. Had more conversions, a higher click-through rate. So we took that, and we applied that with the value props, and it did better. So it should never be like, unless the idea is don't buy our product, which hopefully someone is not writing that ad copy. It shouldn't be left on the cutting room floor. Always test it. Always be willing to learn what works, what doesn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
For this first hire, what's the title of this person, usually in your experience?

Timothy Davis (01:13:38):
Lately, it's been growth marketing specialist, growth marketing manager, because they're going to wear multiple hats. Like at any startup that you're at, you're going to be asked one day to, "Hey, I want you to do performance ads," and then tomorrow it's like, "Hey, I need you to help me build out this spreadsheet for a spec sheet that you have no idea what you're doing." So you're always going to wear multiple hats, so just having a general title like that to start out with. And then if that person matures into a role, you can make them more of a specialist. Or if they start showing signs of like, "Hey, I really like doing the social stuff, and we've scaled enough. Okay, let me hire a paid search person." So yeah, I always start with a general, and then as the team grows, we get more into specialties.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
So growth marketing person, it's kind of like the broad umbrella.

Timothy Davis (01:14:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
And then are these people sitting in Google Ad Manager and Meta Ads and just like running ads manually?

Timothy Davis (01:14:38):
At Shopify, we call it GSD, getting shit done. I'm a firm believer in getting shit done. You should be in the account, like I mentioned earlier with that ops cadence, we have stuff we need to be doing weekly, bi-weekly, monthly. The bigger the company gets, the [inaudible 01:14:55] you wind up in more and more meetings talking about the things you want to do, and how you're going to do it and stuff like that. But keeping those people kind of sheltered away from that and focused on those things, are going to drive the best results for you, you possibly can get.

(01:15:11):
And that means hands-on keyboards in the Ads Manager, tweaking things. Setting up a calendar. I'm a firm believer in setting up a calendar. "We started this test on this day, that means this test will end a month from now." Put a notification, so you have a cool down period, and you report out to the org what you did, how you did it, why you did it, and then the results from it. And then, all right, what we learned from this is this, and we will be applying that to our next test, and this is how. So yeah, hands-on keyboards doing all of those things. So again, hiring those smart people, and just getting out of their way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:47):
I love that. In terms of how this team grows, you mentioned when we were chatting, that you wait for someone to cry uncle, to hire more and to add to the team to kind of avoid bloat. Talk about that.

Timothy Davis (01:16:02):
Unfortunately, we've seen a lot in the news lately with a lot of tech companies letting go of some really talented people, and that is, I feel like just created bloated organizations. We, every month, my current manager, Dean, created this calculator that we look at that says, "How much time are you spending in meetings?" If you have any PTO coming up, put that in there. Optimizations, reporting, stuff like that to basically add up to how many days are in the quarter? Because every quarter... Well, not every quarter, but most quarters you'll have vacation, or you'll have, say, what we call a Shopify burst, where it's we meet in real life to get shit done in real life as opposed to remotely. Put all that in there, and then what does the number equate to? Oh, we're in the red right now for these two to five people.

(01:16:59):
How many quarters has it been that way? Okay, it's only this quarter. This quarter, we have a summit coming up, or we have a burst coming up, or we have a lot of travel because we're meeting with partners, so on and so forth. So maybe this is an isolated thing, let's go ahead and wait till next quarter. All right, next quarter, it's red again. All right, now maybe we need to start having the conversation of, what this new hire will take over, what they will be responsible for, and how much work they'll be taking on and doing, to replace some of this red that is going on.

(01:17:31):
And if it equates to a full head, great, we can move forward, we've made our business case. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes we're just red, and we need to do a better job of making sure, "Hey, we need to step out of these meetings. These meetings are sucking out our time and we don't need to be a part of it." Or, "This launch, we don't need to be a part of. We just need to be consulted on it. We don't need to be in every single meeting every single time, or every single communication." So just making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making-

Timothy Davis (01:18:00):
Just making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making sure that we have stuff for them to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:06):
And red means they have more work?

Timothy Davis (01:18:09):
Yeah. More days than there are in the quarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:12):
And so they basically estimate, "Here's how many days I need to do the things I've committed to for the quarter." And then it's like, "How many actual days do you have this quarter?"

Timothy Davis (01:18:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):
That is super cool. And so step one is, 'Okay, if you're in the red, let's cut some stuff." And then if they're still in the red and you've cut stuff, then, " Okay, we need to start hiring."

Timothy Davis (01:18:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:32):
That is very cool. Is that a Shopify thing or is that something you do at your team?

Timothy Davis (01:18:36):
I've done stuff like that at other companies before, but kind of bringing it forward again, I don't want to take the credit for it. Dean was the one that brought it back up. It was like, "Oh yeah, I used to do this. I don't know why I stopped doing it." So it's definitely something I've used at other companies for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):
That is super cool. You mentioned this opps cadence. Is that something you can describe just what this cadence looks like of how you run?

Timothy Davis (01:18:59):
Yeah. So I love me a spreadsheet. So it's just a spreadsheet. And visually, I'll do my best to describe it. Let's say column A has those buckets I was talking about a finance, performance structure, keywords, so on and so forth. And then within those buckets ... Or let's call those ... Everyone loves rocks and pebbles right now, right? So that's your big rock. Your big rock is keywords.

(01:19:24):
Then within that you have pebbles. Keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negatives, so on, so forth. And then within that we say how often we're doing it. Are we doing it weekly, bi-weekly, monthly? And then that allows us to ... If anyone in the organization's like, "Hey, how often are you guys updating ad copy?" Easy answer. "How often are you guys doing search query reports?" Easy answer, And it allows us to make sure we hold ourselves accountable to those things because a lot of times we have a lot we're doing, We're working in Google, we're working in Meta, we're working in YouTube. You could easily forget, "Oh, I didn't do that. I got to make sure I do that again." So it's a way to hold yourself accountable, but it's also a way for me as a manager to go in and kind of spot check that and make sure that they're doing the things that need to be done in the account.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:19):
The core of this, essentially, there's a spreadsheet that everyone aligns on of here's when and how often we do certain activity to operate this performance marketing machine that you've built.

Timothy Davis (01:20:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:30):
Awesome. And it's both internally so that everyone knows, and then also when people ask, "Hey, when are you going to do this?" "Okay, here's the data."

Timothy Davis (01:20:37):
Yeah. Yeah. So if a cross-functional team or partner wants to know, easy answer. "We got it for you right here. Here's our whole opps cadence."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:46):
In terms of the team, something else folks told me about you is that you're very hardcore about training new people that you hire. What does people mean by that?

Timothy Davis (01:20:56):
Yeah. There's a book called ... I think it's The First 90 Days, and in it actually has a graph that shows when the person starts having impact and how many days it's been. And more times than not, it takes about ... We've all heard it. 90 days for someone to have impact.

(01:21:14):
I want to try and make that 45 days, if not 30. Most of the time it has to do with learning the culture, learning the people understanding, "Yes, you've done paid before at this other job, but this is how we do it here." That's where the opps cadence really comes in handy. It's like, "Here's how often we do it here. I understand maybe you did it monthly there, but we do it here biweekly. And you're saying you used to do it biweekly, we do it weekly and this is how."

(01:21:47):
And also giving them responsibility early on for something. For example, Kat on my team was hired 8ish months ago. She was thrown into the fire very quickly. It was like, "Hey, we have this campaign coming up called additions. Here's everything we did last additions. This is the results. These are your responsibilities, these are the expectations. Go. Go forth and conquer. As you come along. There may be something that doesn't make sense. I'm here by all means ask questions."

(01:22:24):
But what I've noticed is twofold. One, when you're clear in what is expected of them, like, "You are expected to do this when and you already know how to do it. Great." Or also in one-on-ones, I'll just open up the account and say, "Hey, this is how I do it. Let me show you the way I'm doing it and how quick it is for me. And you can learn, even though we're remote, I'm showing you as if you're sitting right over my shoulder or we're face to face. This is how I do it." So if you're doing something different maybe ... One plus one is two, three minus one is two, and that's fine. We both got to the same answer. But if you're doing nine times five minus two times 12 divided by 15, nope, we can simplify this."

(01:23:13):
So making sure that they're efficient and effective with their time, they're focusing on that signal versus that noise and giving them responsibility early on to really take ownership of something. You can see that people are a lot more quicker to pick up things and start getting that flywheel going of, "Hey, I want to have impact as soon as possible." Versus, "Oh, hey, go read this handbook week one. Week two, let me introduce you to the team. Week three." It's like slow rolling. "We can speed this up guys. We can get people up to speed and making impact a lot sooner."

(01:23:52):
And also don't expect them to be perfect. You can't expect people to be perfect right out the gate. " I can't remember every little thing I need to tell you, and there may be things I can learn from you." I can't tell you how many times I'm still learning from people around me. It's like, "Oh, that's great. I didn't even think of that or I haven't tried that. I should totally do that." So just know that they're not going to be perfect out of the gate, but giving them clear direction and expectations, we'll get them where they need to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):
I could see why your team is so effective and so successful. This all makes a lot of sense. You mind if I do a rapid fire set of questions that people asked on Twitter about very specific stuff?

Timothy Davis (01:24:40):
Yeah. By all means.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:41):
Okay, ATT, there was a huge change to the way cookies and attribution and tracking worked online and it felt like paid ads kind of like, "Oh, shit. That's not going to work anymore. It's over. Facebook is dead." Clearly that hasn't happened at this point. Just what is the impact that ATT has had on paid ads and performance marketing?

Timothy Davis (01:25:02):
We were just talking about this the other day because we have ... Full transparency, we have people fully dedicated to mobile on the team, and I had reached out to Sasha who's on the team and said, "Hey, what are we doing with ATT? What are we doing scan? All those things? Because has any of our tactics really changed because of say, low opt-in rates?" And the direct answer I got from her was, "As long as we can use scan to provide attribution and measurement for iOS, we're fine." It's like, "Okay, that's very straightforward. I appreciate it." So as long as you're doing those things, you should be okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:50):
Amazing. That's great. So basically the show goes on, things change, but people find ways to work around it. Okay. Creatives, how impactful are creative in the performance of ads generally? Is that like, "Holy shit. People are way under estimating the power of a creative." Or is it like, "Okay, it's like a fringe impact?"

Timothy Davis (01:26:10):
Way underestimating the power of creative. The best example I can give ... Do you remember Dollar Shave Club?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:19):
Absolutely. Their video.

Timothy Davis (01:26:21):
All right. There you go. You remember it. That was creative. Now the person buying it may have done a really good job of just targeting males, but I would argue girlfriends at the time probably would've been aware of it as well. Really good creative should be doing a really good job of telling a story. And if it does that ... Again, going back to what we talked about at the very beginning, if you get that emotion with users, whether that's pulling at the hard strings or comedy, it's going to have a lasting impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:57):
Okay. Chuck on Twitter asked, "When someone steals your traffic, say in Google search results and buying up keywords around your companies, what should you do? Any advice?"

Timothy Davis (01:27:07):
Yeah. So that actually goes back to the visual that we showed and I'll pull it back up as I'm talking through it. The biggest thing is just know that anyone can do that. You can do it too, if you are ultimately concerned about it. But a lot of times competitors could be doing it on accident. And what I mean by accident is within Google, if you're bidding on keywords, Google will do what's called a close variant. If you were to do say e-commerce solution, I bet you Shopify shows up as a close variant at some point or Square or anyone like that. So they could just be mismanaging their account first and foremost. Don't give them that much credit that they're doing this maliciously or even doing it with intent.

(01:27:59):
And again, it will be in the show notes. If you do pull this report and you do notice that there is a clear threat that's going on here, first things first, let's make sure that they're not doing anything egregious like saying, "Lenny and Tim are better than Monday.com."

(01:28:15):
You cannot be, if the brand is trademarked within Google, they cannot use your name within the ad copy. Google more times than not will disallow it, but they could misspell it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Shopify spelled with two I's because Google isn't catching it, but we can always put in a claim to say, "Hey Google, please remove this."

(01:28:40):
But if we do run this ...You can kind of see that the orange line here, and for those that are just listening. Orange line is rather consistent over time. There is a two week period where it dips, but it does come back up. There's another line that at the beginning of this visual, green is actually above orange. And if you look at the green one over time it almost disappears. So the reason I would say make sure you're looking at this report, and it's not just ego marketing, it could be an error. The issue could be the green one, specifically, could have been getting a close variant. They identified it, they removed it. "Oh wait, a couple of weeks later, we didn't fully remove it. Now let's remove it completely. And now they're almost gone completely." So make sure you're looking at the data and reacting to consistent competitor conquesting versus something that could just be an accident or users not knowing what they're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):
Amazing. And this is PPC Hero again, right? PPChero.com or whatever?

Timothy Davis (01:29:44):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:44):
Okay, cool.

Timothy Davis (01:29:45):
We'll share it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:46):
Yeah. We'll link it to it in the show notes. Okay. Last question. AI. You mentioned AI. You're looking for AI tools to help you with your workflows and analyze data. I guess is there anything you've seen AI impact in the work of paid growth and performance marketing, or is it like in the future might, other than obviously the algorithms on the platforms?

Timothy Davis (01:30:06):
I remember having this conversation a couple of months ago. AI, couldn't get away from it, right? It was everywhere, and what we were doing was leadership on know, "In all of our quarterly planning, what are we doing about AI? How are we using ai? What are we doing that's different?"

(01:30:28):
As always, I go to the partners and I say, "Hey, what are we doing about this?" And Francisco at Google, actually, he made a really good point. "You guys have been using AI for years now. Smart Bidding is AI. All of the recommendations within Google Ads is AI. Ad copy recommendations is AI, and that's always been in the platform, so we've always used those things."

(01:30:59):
So it was kind of like, let's reset the conversation of, "Hey, this has been here. We have been using it, this is how we've been using it and moving forward, these are some of the things we think we'll start doing." I do think it's having a huge impact from a content standpoint and a creative standpoint. Now, if those two kind of converge together, you have a perfect storm, right? But it is something that I keep a relative close eye on, but like I said earlier, hopefully some of your users can share more information with me. But it's not something that I would say is overly impactful yet, but I could see how it could be used maliciously if you can do API connections and things along those lines, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):
Wait, what do you mean by that?

Timothy Davis (01:31:49):
Again, Google will disallow certain things, but it takes time sometimes. If the term is copyrighted in Google for ad copy, it'll disallow it immediately. But say they need to do a check, you'll see a lot of times under review or pending in the account. But you'll also see impressions potentially attached to that. It's because Google's like, "Oh, we'll serve a little bit of it, and then if it's malicious, we'll pull it back." I could see a way that somebody could automate AI to where it's always updating it to where it's like, "Oh, let's just get a little drip here, a little drip here, a little drip here." And that little drip equates to a lot, but that's something AI could help with a human doing that would just take forever and be a total waste of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:34):
Got it. Just run tons of ads, just keep trying, trying, trying trying stuff. Slip through the cracks. You mentioned creative. It actually came back to question I forgot to ask. Going back to the team that you hired to run this sort of stuff, you hire this one person, growth marketer, specialist type of person, and the next hire is a creative. What's a sign that it's time to hire the creative person? Is there anything there? Is it just like, "We have budget and this is working?" Or is there anything else of, "Like, okay, this is a good time?"

Timothy Davis (01:33:00):
Yeah, if you're using a creative agency and they're getting you everything you want and you're happy with it, then it may not make sense to hire a creative. But more times not what I've noticed from creative ... Creative independence tend to do better than an agency. The biggest difference I see is that matching the right tone, matching the right creative look and feel that you're going for is accomplished way better in-house, and also coming up with new ideas that you can test quickly and iterate on versus, "We only have so many hours with the agency this month, or we only have so much budget we can spend with them." Where if you have that person in-house fully dedicated to the product itself, you'll never run into those caps.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):
It feels like if anywhere that scenario AI is going to empower that initial hire to do more creative on their own, you would think?

Timothy Davis (01:33:56):
Yeah. Yeah. And that's not always the best way to go. I've seen some ads in there where it's like, "Oh yeah, they're being scrappy. I see what they're doing." But to your point, maybe that's where AI kind of bridges the gap. Because I can't tell you how many times in the past it's like, Guys, we've got to be able to do retargeting, but we have no creative to do." Google has the dynamic ad builder and they've had it for I feel like years now, and that was just like, "Give us a couple of images and we will make a display ad for you that should perform because we're testing many different iterations of it." Meta is probably going to come along with something as well that it's like, "Give us a picture of your product and we'll put different backgrounds on it and test what works and what doesn't." Things along those lines.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:45):
That makes so much sense. Timothy, we've covered so much ground. This is everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think would be important or valuable for listeners when they're trying to do this stuff on their own? Any other nuggets left that we haven't already covered?

Timothy Davis (01:35:05):
Yeah. I said it at one point, but I'll reiterate it. I'm always forward thinking, backwards planning. Just as you're going through it, "Where do you want to be and ultimately how do you think you're going to get there?" Because say your goal is to be on all platforms. "I want to be on Pinterest, I want to be on X, I want to be on everything." "Okay, forward think. That's where you want to be. Now let's backwards plan. "What can we do right now? We can do search because that's only content and that's keywords. We can do that. All right, now we need creative, but where do we start?" And then make iterations along the way. It's just always forward think, backwards plan, and that's for anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:49):
What are other examples of forward thinking? Because in a sense everyone will be like, "I want to be on every platform." I guess what are other things that people think about when they're like, the forward thinking is like, "Oh, we want to win Google search." Is that an example of forward thinking? What else? What else should people thinking?

Timothy Davis (01:36:06):
Yeah, exactly. What are those goals you want to hit? One of the things that we look at is what emerging channels to perform in it. "So what is it going to take for us to consider this channel a performing channel that is an always on, we're we're adopting it as BAU? So that's going to take a thousand conversions a month at this much spend with this much lift associated with it. So okay, we know what that looks like, so we're going to backwards plan where we're going to start. We're going to start with this one ad creative. "Okay, that works. Then we're going to go to this next ..." Because within each platform, they all have multiple types of ad units You can use. Say in LinkedIn, there's feed, there's conversation, there's video, there's carousel. So it's what are the milestones along the way that you're going to do to ultimately get it from testing emerging channel to perform them? So that would be an example of something more micro than macro.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:16):
Got it. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Timothy Davis (01:37:22):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
First question. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Timothy Davis (01:37:28):
Daily Stoic by far. A book I read every day. Quick excerpt of what you can do from a stoic philosophy standpoint. Great By Choice is another good one. And Deep Work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):
Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Timothy Davis (01:37:49):
X-Men '97. Thoroughly enjoyed that. But that may be a lot of nostalgia. I actually never watched RRR when it first came out. Highly recommend that. That was a lot more enjoyable than I was anticipating. The Playlist, which is about Spotify, Welcome to Wrexham and Billion Dollar Code, also on Netflix, about Google Earth. Very interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:16):
Yeah, RRR. That movie is intense and very long also. It's like, man, I

Timothy Davis (01:38:21):
Three and a half hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:23):
... just have to split it up into different days to finish it, but it is incredible. No intent. Okay. Favorite recent product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Timothy Davis (01:38:31):
I drink too much caffeine and I've been trying to cut it out and I kind of circled back to this product I used to use called Magic Mind. It's a little shot every single day. Tastes really good and it does help with focus I find. If it's a placebo, great, I don't care, but it's helping me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:52):
That's amazing. I'm also a huge fan of Magic Mind. I'm friends with the guy that started it. So funny that you love it. I drink it often.

Timothy Davis (01:38:53):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:00):
I am on the subscription plan and I think he uses Shopify to sell it.

Timothy Davis (01:39:05):
He does. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:06):
It all connects. Amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family? Find useful in work in life?

Timothy Davis (01:39:15):
Happiness is dedicated by expectations or dictated by expectations. That can't be more true more times than not, and it's similar. That's why I said there's two, and this one's similar to it. You won't see it for what it is until you stop looking through the lens of what you want it to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:35):
Amazing. It reminds me of an equation a colleague of mine once shared. He wrote a book of emotional equations or life equations. It was happiness is reality minus expectations.

Timothy Davis (01:39:48):
Yeah. Love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:51):
Okay, next question. Who's had the most influence on you in your career?

Timothy Davis (01:39:56):
Well, we mentioned him before, so I got to bring him back up. Kasey Winters for sure. We were at a wedding. He showed me the original version of Google Analytics. For those of you that don't know, it's called Urchin, and when he showed that to me, it was, "Wait, you know all of this information about users coming to the site." I knew I wanted to do marketing, but at that moment I knew I was going to do digital marketing and watch him grow in his career. He's watching me grow in my career. We still balance each questions off of each other. We cannot not have a phone call under an hour. So definitely the most impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:36):
Is there something about Casey Winters that people may not know? He's a two time podcast guest, huge friend of the show.

Timothy Davis (01:40:44):
Casey is really good at tennis, like insanely good at tennis. You want to know how good? This is how good he was. In high school, he played ... I'm pretty sure it was our senior year. He hadn't played in a year, maybe a year plus. He was still ranked top 10 in the state of Louisiana for tennis players. Hasn't played in a year and still considered one of the top 10 players. Insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):
Did not know that. I actually played tennis in high school, and so that's amazing. I did not know this. Thanks for sharing that. Timothy, this was incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people figure out [inaudible 01:41:28] marketing, run more paid growth ads, figure out who to bring in to help them do this. Thank you so much for sharing and for being here.

Timothy Davis (01:41:36):
Of course. Appreciate the time.

# Tobi Lütke's leadership playbook: First principles, infinite games, and maximizing human potential

## Transcript

Tobi Lütke (00:00:00):
Your podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders, what is your energy source? My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. There are so many books are about this ... Technology leading to dystopia. Like no one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today. I think today is the dystopia of the future. It behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that leads in ... Towards progress.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
There's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. "If most people are doing it a certain way I by default don't want to do it that way."

Tobi Lütke (00:00:34):
There's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do, usually without an accent. They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the chart that is behind them. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with outperformance? Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive. The most powerful unquantifiable things in the word of business are fun and delight.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
I don't know of any other company that operates where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.

Tobi Lütke (00:01:11):
I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically, to make entrepreneurship more common.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Tobi Lütke (00:01:37):
I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. Reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:54):
Today my guest is Tobi Lütke. Toby is a man who needs no introduction so I'm going to keep this very short and get you right to this jam-packed conversation. If you enjoy this podcast don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that I bring you Tobi Lütke. This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts you need them to reach users reliably, that's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.

(00:02:42):
And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience. Plus, you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world. And they're helping Lenny's Podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

Welcome to the podcast.

Tobi Lütke (00:04:24):
I'm glad to be here. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):
I've listened to so many of your other interviews, I've talked to a bunch of people that work for you. I want to try to do something a little different. There's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as I've listened to you share advice, and interview, and in talking to people that work for you. One is thinking from first principles, the other is maximizing human potential. I'm just going to plant these seeds for now. I'm going to not ask about these directly, I'm going to come at these from the side with the many questions that I have for you. Something that I've heard people describe at Shopify called the Tobi tornado.

Tobi Lütke (00:05:01):
Oh, wow. Okay, that's a start. I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
What is the Tobi tornado?

Tobi Lütke (00:05:08):
A Tobi tornado, I would say, is a whole lot of change management or a conversation or conflict or real talk compressed into a very short timeframe. I see something it doesn't ... It's not good, I have a conversation. I have learned something very quickly about hey, I need to update my priors, or cool, let's do it differently. At which point a project might be stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of a product. And everyone who's currently on the team, of that particular project, is no longer on the project but they are the founders of the next version which is built differently. And that might be a bit whiplashy for people. I mean, I certainly hope that's true, it's certainly what people tell me. It's also what they appreciate about the company. It's like what is best ends up mattering a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:08):
Basically, it's you going into a chat room being like "Hey, this" ... "We're going to end this project we're" ... "Let's try something else" because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea. Some people complain about this practice of like "Oh, Tobi kills the we've been working on." My lens is, you realize we're just wasting time on this thing that is not going to work and we shouldn't do it. Is there anything there along those lines?

Tobi Lütke (00:06:32):
No. This is everything. Again, once I imagine something might be not the right thing to work on I'm either incorrect at which point this is super important that I understand why or I'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it. There's a third wave which is I could also ignore it but that's an abjection of my CEO and founder responsibility that I'm absolutely not willing to make so that's just not a path forward that I see valid. I understand that's what a lot of people choose to do. So yeah, compressing time is important. We have a fairly limited time in our careers, right? Our careers are not that long. If you're lucky you have 40 years in the industry. Most people spent more time in school and then maybe leave later if they're so lucky that they can. So it's not even that.

(00:07:33):
I think you want to do the maximum amount of things you can be proud of at the end of your career. When you look back you want to be saying, "Hey, holy shit, we shipped this thing which was absolutely an incredible contribution to a mission I cared about at a company that was full of other people who cared as much as I did." And also are very proud of working. And maybe even thinking of working with me and being really, really glad that we spent time on projects together. Yeah, none of this happens if everyone's sort of optimizing a thing that probably shouldn't be there, right? And, therefore, I think it's the better thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:16):
And, by the way, I love this way of describing ... Of compressing it in time to just make a decision, not focus on making it come across the most kind, nicest, sweetest way. When you give feedback to people when something is not the way that you think it could be or as good as you could be it's often very direct and often hard to hear. To me this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential, you're trying to push them to do something better. Is there anything there that you think is a way of approaching feedback?

Tobi Lütke (00:08:49):
I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. I just think everyone is way, way, way, way, way better than they think. And the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and, therefore, we could not take advantage of them. It's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things at which point you get stuck competing with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious.

(00:09:33):
I have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do. And I have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves. Now, in a way, this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed, right, in myself. By the way, I'm talking about myself here too. I think I have way more potential than what I bring to bear and I hate that so I'm trying to cultivate the skills that I need for tomorrow and constantly challenge myself. I'm harder on myself than on anyone else. By some discount rate act equally to the people around me, especially the ones who just so, obviously, are brilliant.

(00:10:23):
Spending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard means that they accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could. To me this is the most wonderful thing to see. And frankly this is a throughline for all of my career because this ... My product is that. I want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could. And, in fact, become more ambitious about what they are building with their online stores and their businesses than they are actually initially set out to do.

(00:10:56):
Because something like this happened to me, right? I started a snowboard store at some point. I didn't set out to build Shopify. If you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step, and optimize for maximum amount of learning when you choose these steps, it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential and progress. Maybe people are not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it. School teaches you that you have to learn this particular piece of math in this 12 month period, and it doesn't matter how much you understand it. It's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which has nothing to do with anything I've ever seen or learned or see ... Or witnessed about how to actually learn things. You follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth. In a way Shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction. I've just seen this to come to be true. And, of course, hearing from someone that you respect that "Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you and I expected" ... "I think the next time this happens in your career you should go path A because" ... "Based on your conviction." And, therefore, that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right? What I love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to the actual potential rather than sort of their current level plus or ... Plus some, I don't know, a little bit extra.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):
There's so many threads I want to follow here. The example of the school is such a pertinent one. To me right now we're looking at preschools for our son and I'm ... They're describing their education philosophy I'm like, I don't know why I should believe this is the right approach. And it makes me just want to spend all this time researching what education approach works. I know it's just preschool and maybe not as critical yet.

Tobi Lütke (00:13:38):
Did you have a bet yet? I have three kids too and this is sort of a decision that every parent faces, right? So many of your listeners are probably product managers of machine learning products that maybe this resonates. So there's a funny thing about machine learning which you're just like ... You train on a lot of data, and, hopefully, you get something that predicts the thing you want it to predict correctly out of it. The biggest problem of this is overfitting, right? What does good look like, a loss function? Which is a heuristic because it's not the actual task that the thing will do in the future it's something that proxies to the task that you want the thing to do in the future. Predict fraud, predict the next word, whatever. So overfitting is basically model learning how to cheat on the benchmark or on the fitness function.

(00:14:39):
So there's a business analogy of this which is that ... It's called Goodhart's law. It's literally the same thing as overfitting just for businesses. Goodhart's law just says, "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric." Same exact thing. The universal truths are things that almost any competitive field will invent for itself by different terminology often. And I think this is also, by the way, why it's so interesting to focus on personal growth and learning a lot about a lot because you end up finding these sort of hidden harmonies behind things, the things that are clearly enduring correct insights. So overfitting, Goodhart's law are the same thing. School optimizes for what? Marks supposedly, right? In fact, overfitting in school is literally the kids cheating to get marks, right? You get another analogy. What is however the right loss function for children? Have you made a decision yet?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):
No, I have not we just started down this path. You told me-

Tobi Lütke (00:15:55):
It's the kind of thing [inaudible 00:15:57]. You have to actually go fairly deep in philosophy to figure this out. And then again afterwards you can build, you can find the schools that you like. For us it was just maintaining curiosity. This is a completely different goal from being good at marks. But I just think everyone's born extremely curious and school has a habit of getting it out of kids. Literally, there's a foundation model of a child, and you fine-tune it at school, and it just loses the neurons of curiosity because it's actually discouraged to meander into other topics and explore them just because they're interesting. I don't know. This is sort of not the beat of a podcast but I just think about this a lot. It's funny how these things just recur constantly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):
So when Archie was on the podcast, he's the head of growth at Shopify ... I don't know if that's his official role. Basically drives a lot of the growth. He talked about how the core product team, outside of the growth team, operates without KPIs, without specific goals. And decisions are driven by taste and intuition primarily you, and Glen, and some other leaders. And a lot of people heard that and they're like "I" ... "First, I don't believe that. Second of all, how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly what is right and good?" So the question I have is just how does one operate in that way successfully? What does it take for a company to work that way because a lot of people will try it and fail?

Tobi Lütke (00:17:25):
This is very close to what I just talked about before with [inaudible 00:17:28]. Goodhart's law is real. The moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer a useful metric, right? I think that's more or less a precise wording. Why? Because no metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business because business are complex. There's a million of different tensions in a company and you can't all keep them in harmony by optimizing for one fix. It's true that we don't have KPIs and we don't have at least OKRs in the Silicon Valley sense but we are extremely data-informed. We have invested enormous amounts of money and time into systems that give us basically everything at our fingertips. I sent this demo to other founders and they're completely bowled over by the way we can dig into basically every constituent atomic bit part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago by the end of a ... At the end of a quarter or month or week.

(00:18:39):
In a lot of different places, this is one of them but also in its products, it's just not overfitting for the quantifiable. Everyone competes for everything but it's highly quantifiable because it's ... It's fun, it's like a game. You tweak a number and 0.1 more is better than 0.1 less. That's an immediate gratification thing. But I just think the overlap of most valuable things you can do with a product, and for things that happen to be fully quantifiable, it's like maybe 20% which leaves 80% of a value space unaddressable by the people who will only look at quantifiable things. Shopify is comfortable with the unquantifiable things such as tastes, quality, passion, love, hate. It's with the strong emotions that people have.

(00:19:49):
The sort of deep satisfaction that a craftsperson feels when they've done a job well is actually better proxy if you allow it to be then the ... Do a unit test pass. A unit tests might not pass. And the unit tests will pass 15 minutes later because we already fix them or adjust the one or two things so they support us. We have systems that tell us exactly if something goes the wrong way. There's an extremely sophisticated rollout system in Shopify that forever holdouts and correlates everything with everything for ... In every experiment and so on and so on and so on. But if you think about it as a cockpit for a pilot. The decisions are still made by pilots and we think this leads to better results. It's just the same with our product. There's plenty of A/B testing tools and all these things for commerce, and it's, of course, really important to figure out what your conversion rates are. But are you representing your brand is an unquantifiable question? Are you proud of the thing that you have built? Do you feel it's your own, right?

(00:21:03):
And so I think there needs to be more acceptance in businesses or for unquantifiable things. The most powerful, not unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight. If people have fun when they're doing something that is just upstream from so ... Sorry, downstream from so many other things. I think that if all the metrics are pointing down but everyone says, "My God, I'm having so much more fun," I think that the very next thing that will happen with some time delay is all metrics will start going up. And if that doesn't happen then we adjust course.

(00:21:51):
The reason why we specifically don't have OKRs and these things is because ... If you want to hold the unquantifiable as things that are stable and exist ... That people actually do really defer to them and really actually learn to be okay with someone just saying, "Hey, this is actually just really great and they're shipping this" then you need to make certain edits to a business that don't remind everyone too much of the companies they might have come from which the only way to get promoted is by driving the metric up. It's a bit of a [inaudible 00:22:24] conversation I suppose. Good on the fortune cookies saying, "Shopify doesn't do OKRs or doesn't do metrics" and so on. But it's actually just because the metrics take us [inaudible 00:22:37] function where we often defer to just more ... Sometimes a little bit emotional but generally less quantifiable things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I imagine if someone were to hear you describe this of focus on joy, and fun, and love, and delight, maybe ... It's easy to dismiss that.

Tobi Lütke (00:22:58):
It sounds completely idiotic, right? Again, there's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do usually without an accent, have a full head of hair. They talk about metrics, they are in front of PowerPoint presentations, they usually have a stick and show dramatically at the pie chart that is behind them. And highly charismatic, highly ... So that's our aesthetic. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with our performance? I don't know but some of them ... Some people pull it off who are like this. I think the world is sort of stacked to lead us astray based on our stories about what optimal looks like are just so incorrect in so many ways. Optimism always sounds dumb, or at least naive. Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Metrics driven sounds extremely sophisticated. Talking about fun sounds like naive.

(00:24:14):
Well, first of all, I've always ignored what people think generally. That came pretty natively to me somehow which I'm very lucky about. But I've now actually learned that almost all of the alpha in the world is now in the ... Exactly the things that are unobvious but true. And the things that people dismiss as naive or so. The most successful business person on planet Earth is Elon and he conforms to no idea of what the most sophisticated business person ought to be like in any which way you can imagine. I think we live in a world where the counterfactuals are winning because our ... Because aesthetics are just leading us astray.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
This is an awesome segue to the other theme that I wanted to spend some time on which is thinking from first principles, Elon is the classic example of that. Honestly, I think you're the other most classic example of that these days. And we'll keep talking about all the ways you operate very differently from other companies which are examples of this. But I want to read a quote from Glen Coates, he shared with me, of how he sees you that gives an interesting lens into your first principles thinking. So here's what he said about you. "Tobi is at his heart a true futurist, he's obsessed with the way things should be in the future. Being data-driven is innately being anchored in the way users and technology are behaving today. He's never really said this to me explicitly, but knowing him I think any design that is drawn primarily from the way things are or were is one that he sees as inferior to one that is skating to the puck of the way things could or should be." Does that resonate?

Tobi Lütke (00:25:55):
Yeah. I mean, I think that's correct. That's actually really interesting. Your podcast is a podcast by a-

Tobi Lütke (00:26:01):
Your podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders is like, "What is your energy source? Where are you getting energy from?" I think fundamentally the world exists at room temperature. Almost all companies are running at that, humming along, doesn't do anything. There are certain individuals who can inject heat into businesses. Founders do this very well. All the startups anyone's ever heard of have people who are injecting heat because if no one would inject heat into the business, at room temperature, you cannot outperform anyone else. You can't be hotter than everyone else if no one's injecting heat into the concern. So fundamentally, there is a injection of energy into companies that comes from founders and the best leaders, like all the people you've had on the podcast from Shopify have a perfect set of cast of characters of people who are just exothermic. They are just like wellsprings of energy that leads to all the amazing results that we get to enjoy.

(00:27:21):
So the question is where does energy comes from? And that's another one of our discussions which very quickly goes into the emotions. Actually, there's a really... So I watched The Last Dance, the Netflix special of Michael Jordan a while ago, of course, but there was one scene where he just, I'm sure this is a super famous story and he just made up an insight that someone told him so that he would then go and just want to destroy them afterwards, which he then of course proceeded to do because it's hard to imagine anyone more exothermic than him. So we know what his energy source is. It's rivalry. It's potentially it's insight or it's anger, something like this.

(00:28:06):
I am not... My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. My fundamental belief is all this talk about technology where all... So many books are about just technology leading to dystopia. You know what dystopia is? Today, compared to what it will be in 20 years ago or any. And you can play this for any part of human history. I'm not making a future statement. I'm making a almost totalical statement about the experience on planet Earth. No one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today rather than today. And so I think today is the dystopia of future, and I think it behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that lead in towards progress in a small way or a big way. But yes, I think if someone comes to me and says, "Hey, let's go do this thing. And we've looked around and here's how people solve this problem, let's make a good version of that," I'm like, "That was not the job." Because everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true.

(00:29:38):
The entire field of... What was it? I forgot the name of a field. Chomsky's field, the linguistic research field. It's cool. We now have autoregressive models that are just like, we don't actually need to set up a complete... We don't need to research the structure of grammar to be able to make machines also engage in the spoken word. We actually can just train on the internet, it turns out. So that was not possible back then because you didn't have the right architecture for this, but now it is. So I think what you have to do is to actually have, when you come up with a new product or you discuss a new product, you have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, "How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?"

(00:30:25):
For that, to do that, you actually have to understand the power and the composability of all the building blocks that exist right now, which is a tall order and no one is perfect at this. But so this way, you go ahead and say, "Okay, cool, so this is how we are implementing this thing. This is how it will be implemented today." And now we can talk ourselves in taking shortcuts. "Maybe we should actually start up doing it the way everyone else does. Maybe we derived exactly what everyone else does as the correct thing to do."

(00:30:56):
Sometimes there was a lot more wisdom encoded in the status quo than you expect, which is I think is super delightful. Then you figure that out and so when you act on it. But what isn't okay is skipping the exercise and doing the same thing everyone else does because that is again a abdication of product leadership. And so yeah, I would say I become extremely suspicious if I get a pitch to do a good version of the same thing everyone else does because I just find that in our space specifically very rarely to be the best solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:33):
There's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. "If most people are doing it a certain way, I, by default, don't want to do it that way. And if you want to do something world-class, you can't do it like everyone else."

Tobi Lütke (00:31:46):
Yeah. I don't even think that's an opinion that I hold. I think that's actually... We are basically in axiom territory here. If you want to do something better than what exists, you have to do it differently. That does not make a statement about if it will be better in the end after you do it. It could also be worse. But you can't get something better done if you do the same thing. It's like axiomatically not possible to do. It's fails Archimedean logic, yet it's something... You would be amazed how many business plans are actually failing Archimedean logic in this way like, "Let's do a good version of this thing that we've already been doing and we will capture 1% of the market," and just like this stuff. It's like, "Trust me." I find it kind of cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):
Is there an example that you can share of you approaching the problem this way? I imagine it's constantly happening. You also mentioned you're born this way. So I think it's hard for someone to just sit down, learn, think the way Tobi thinks, but I'd love to help people start to approach problems this way, so maybe an example might help.

Tobi Lütke (00:32:54):
I think this is entirely learnable, I think. And so I encourage people to just have a practice of think step by step essentially and just do it. It'll become a habit pretty quickly because it just, it also just outperforms.

(00:33:09):
Examples. The very first example is Shopify itself. It's cool. So there was lots of e-commerce software and it was all the way it was because of path dependence because everyone who want it in 2004, 2005, e-commerce was an existing retailer and therefore they had complex businesses that needed to be ported online, including all of their somewhat Byzantine business logic. "I wanted to make e-commerce software that would do very well on the internet of the future and I believe that we can make it easier to start new businesses online than it is in a physical world because the physical world is encumbered by a lot of regulations and also upfront costs for leases and so on. So let's optimize for that case and build something that is so intuitive to use that frustrated people in dead-end careers can spend their lunch breaks making progress towards building their own business, which then eventually allows them to do it on their own way."

(00:34:25):
And so being fortune was biased, eventually it turns out to be a much better prep for also solving all the enterprise cases because no one had to... Enterprise software is overfit to the sales process, which is that it wins the RFPs because it has every feature ever or at least a way of putting a checkbox next to every RFP line ever. But they're not good, right? An RFP is a great example of overfitting in the world of procurement because it tells you nothing about the quality of software behind it. But honestly, this happens all the time. It is just like here, we are setting the stage for much more, much higher quality retrieval for the products on Shopify and across Shopify. I think we've been in a local maxima on search and we think that, especially with the advances of the new models, certain things are now possible to do that could not have been done yet because again of these layers and layers of path dependence and no one coming and saying, "Is that the best way to do and maybe we should rebuild this component periodically?" We can now do a better job if search that will leads to much more delightful experiences. And so this is a fun project that this happening right now in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):
I think this is really interesting because what I'm looking for is like the Tobi algorithm of first principles thinking. Elon's got these famous ways of thinking he shared. One is start with the cost of metal to help you understand how much a rocket should cost. And then he's got this five-step. First, decide, do we need this thing? Then figure out how to optimize it, then automate it. What I'm hearing so far, and I'm curious if you've thought about this? And if not, this feels like a really good blog post in your futures, the Tobi first principles algorithm, but I'll share a couple of things I've heard so far as you've described it.

(00:36:24):
One is analyze the path that existing solution has relied on, almost like the assumptions that were true for it to be built back and it was built. And the other is this overfit, what is it overfit for? What is it over solving that maybe isn't necessary? Is there anything along those lines of just how you approach problems?

Tobi Lütke (00:36:43):
This is probably too nerdy technical. You are right, but I should figure myself out a little bit. My brain runs on a meter language but isn't directly something I can translate into words, I suppose. I think more about things like this in terms of programming constructs, pure functions, overstate. And I think in any moment, the best decision to do is I think the perfect product lead is almost like a thermostat for high quality product. It's like you're setting, saying, "I would like to build something really, really great and I'm going to go through a series which is much, much more complex than what a thermostat does," which basically checks the temperature and then makes a decision of air con or heating. You make you re-derive literally every decision that is valuable, every foundational assumption, every foundational ABC direction. And you want to see the observation you've made in the meantime since you last derived the next step. Re-running the entire function over the state that is now updated, the higher fidelity information, would you come to the very same thing?

(00:38:08):
Sometimes fairly early in the construct in the tree of foundational assumptions, change is made. An example we all had was beginning of COVID when we suddenly had shelter in place. So Shopify has that incredibly good office spaces and we were very in-person company and we've... Our floor plans because I think we really added something to the understanding of how to put great... I got a lot of founder energy from my co-founder, Daniel, to build great collaborative spaces for creative work with lots of happy accidents, people running into each other and so on.

(00:38:46):
Anyway, we were very, very, very, very determined on doing that. But somewhere in this construct of nesting functions, you have to rerun and foundational assumptions. It's in the stack is the fairly basic Boolean of are people allowed to leave a house? Which was yes. The moment that flips, it's not that just like, "Okay, over here let's do the best what we can do." It's actually that the entire tree now moves into a different place. And it can be a very far place, different, that you land because you will make the same quality of decision on every step, but you need to rerun something that takes you to a completely different landing zone. And so then this is also easy for us to say, "Cool, we are going to be remote only forever? Let's go." And because we realized that the temporal shelter in place would cause a series of events that would make that for optimal best set of trade-offs for the company. And so I think this is... Can I put this into a piffy five-step? I wouldn't know, but maybe it resonates with someone who can help me figure out the coded English language for this because it has been nerdy way the I explained it, even to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
This remote work example is something I definitely wanted to touch on, which is I'm glad you got there. So in this decision, is there anything more you could share about how you got to that place of like, "Oh this Boolean changed so we should rethink this?" Because I know you probably, you weren't... I don't know. Were you in the shower and just like, "Oh wow, we should really go remote because of this"? How did that actually come about? And then I wanted to ask on another part-

Tobi Lütke (00:40:27):
Yeah, pretty much actually yes because again, I rerun over all the inputs and figure out what happens. And here's a couple of other things that were starting to fray on the decision to be in person as well. We started in Ottawa, Canada, which is a city of a million people, and it has some tech heritage and good universities. But at a million people, it's just not population dense enough and has a depth of talent pool that it can support a company that is going to 10,000 people. So anyone who runs this optimization function I'm talking about here about location strategy for a new startup will come to the conclusion if they do it right that everyone should be sitting around the same table. Only if you can't do that, do you say, "Okay, let's be all in the same couple of rooms." Only if that doesn't work anymore, you say, "Okay, let's be spread over one floor." If that doesn't work, in the same building. If that doesn't work, in the same city. If that doesn't work, at least stay in the same time zones or make sure that there's good hub connections between.

(00:41:39):
This is how it works. It's just like some assumption somewhere along the line is invalidated. You end up in a different side of a decision tree. But what was happening to us was we already were in four or five cities. We were adhering to the same time zone at this point. But my experience was I went through, sometimes at the Ottawa office, through an entire day where I had 10 hours of meetings, which is fairly normal, but I do every single... I don't think I had a single other person sometimes with me because every one of them was with people in another office. Some people are dialing in remote and so on. So there was an awkward hybrid-ness which we ended up in making only good decisions along the way.

(00:42:29):
This is actually the most dangerous thing. Most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree, in a local maxima of a path-dependent environment, by only making good choices. People think that making a good choice inoculates you from making mistakes or that the presence of a downside of an idea ends up disqualifying the idea. Both of those things are incorrect. So what you need to do then is... So that was an overlay to decision.

(00:42:59):
The moment COVID started, then we also had this thing of shoppers exploding because we were actually an asset to people during COVID, e-commerce for the local businesses. And we took that very, very seriously trying to make more businesses survive COVID, small businesses survive this particular calamity than otherwise won't which is important because small businesses tend to be wiped out first anytime the times turn fragile. And so we needed to staff up. And so there's a very weird question about where to staff up. So clearly the better input there would be if you could hire people everywhere. And so once that decision flipped, you can see how this is actually now super easy to say, "We are going to remote," because there is no turning back. There is no... Even with this decision, it's a better set of trade-offs for the future is to accept the vast additional difficulty of building a remote company. It's way harder.

(00:44:03):
It's not something you should recommend to anyone to do this because it's the same as trying to run a world record marathon run in Aspen, Colorado. It's like there's not enough oxygen up there to do that. But if you end up pulling it off, you're a real Chad. That's very cool. So I find difficulty itself interesting. And again, I spent enough of my teenage years on the internet to know that there's amazing cultures that can be put together purely remote like, I don't know, Wikipedia, World of Warcraft, Raiding Guilds can at least have excellent cultures. And so we are like, "Okay, cool. Let's come to a new stable part." That stable part was don't port the office online. Let's port the internet into a company and then we are like, "Let's go."

I want to talk about this talent stack concept that you've touched on a couple of times that I think so much. But before we get there, I want to go in a different direction, which I think is an interesting foundational element to your ability to be successful in your first principles thinking, which is you getting to the metal, to the core of the problems you're solving by actually spending a lot of time coding. And I actually heard a story about how you all had this huge all-hands summit. You flew everyone in. You're all together. There was a three-day hackathon. And the way it was described is you're sitting at a table with headphones in, coding, just like any IC engineer. No one would've known you're the CEO of this company, the founder of this company. Why is coding and working in the code to you still so important?

Tobi Lütke (00:46:46):
It's so funny that that's the way the story goes. It's right, but I don't know why that is surprising. That's my happy place, being able to clear out free days of my calendar and being there till midnight with all these remarkable people who join us on journey, just building stuff. It's like, I do my job so that that is the jobs that exist for other people. That's a job I actually want. That's the one I couldn't find because no one did a company for me. But at least back in most days, I think still not really.

(00:47:26):
And so I just love coding. It's one of the greatest, I don't know, hobbies and pursuits. I've done it for a very long time. I came across it very, very early. It fits my brain like a glove. I appreciate so much of the craft behind coding. I am a trained apprentice in... Sorry, I've apprenticed as a programmer in Germany, which has a dual education system that you can do such things. So I've been professionally in companies spending all day. And I really mean it, programming ever since I just turned 16. I think first day was just before I turned 16 when I started my apprenticeship.

(00:48:18):
And so I love it. I have a view on my screen left of you is a cursor right now, which is opened to a Juniper notebook where I'm working on some projection stuff that I'm playing with. I try to sanity-check as much as I can of what I get. I try to find... It's a game for me to find new insights in data. And I just think, I don't know, it was cool. Maybe this is the picture you talk about. There is a picture that someone captured, which is really fun where I'm on my laptop with a bunch of engineers and then Harley, so president, is on stage DJing. This was taken at 1:00 AM or something like this. It's a picture which actually really precious to two of us because it perfectly summarizes our relationship in a way which these happy accidents are wonderful and these long journeys, I've been doing Shopify for 20 years now, so I appreciate these artifacts. But yeah, so...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):
To be clear, the reason this is unusual is, and why someone told me this story, is most CEOs do not do this, don't just sit there and code along with the team. And the reason I thought this story was important is and the reason I think your first principle approach works is you're actually in the engineering details, similar to Elon if you think about it, of just in the weeds doing the thing, understanding how the thing works, not just coming up with ideas out of pontifications. And so I guess is there anything there of just how important it is, if you want to approach thinking from first principles, it is to be really close to the metal, to the bare metal?

Tobi Lütke (00:50:11):
Well, yeah. First principles thinking starts from, I think Elon puts it as physics, which I think is a little bit atoms-coded. I think just from the atomic building blocks really is a right starting point. Atomic building blocks are the computers we are using. Computers are our instruments. We use them to create the music that when people appreciate to receive in the form of software. So you've got to understand how they work, at least to work the way I do.

(00:50:48):
Now, is the way I work optimal? Of course not. This is my point about the aesthetics of how to behave, how to work. I probably don't conform to the traditional view of what the most of public companies should be like or even should spend their time, but I think I'm successful because I don't try to conform to anything other than what I've learned works. And so what I learned works is be in as many details as you can. Really, really, really just understand the stuff that we are making decisions about and be willing to don't put too much stake into the sunk cost fallacy. Try to inoculate business or your parts of a company from a sunk cost fallacy as much as possible because that allows you to just see better solutions and so on.

(00:51:45):
And I think what we were doing, if I remember right, is at hack dates is we were working through pros or cons of just merging all of Shopify into one huge monorepo and we are sketching out directory structures and tooling that we would need, and...

Tobi Lütke (00:52:00):
... tooling that we would need and... Again, monorepo, now for companies, it's a very much one of those door A, door B kind of things. It's a very consequential choice that is incorrect to go say yes to at a certain size, and then it becomes very correct in my mind to say yes to, but at that point it's an enormous amount of effort. So, it's a kind of thing that actually is something I'm uniquely positioned to be involved with because it's actually a business strategy thing as well. That's an investment, a very real investment to say, "Hey, let's change the way we are building system. Let's figure out what the best way is."

(00:52:47):
There's going to be change management. There's going to be some people that have very strong opinions on yes or no. And frankly, "Tobi said so.", helps. It also compresses a lot of time, because everyone knows the way I book. Everyone can come to me with better ideas about anything, and if you're right, I will change my mind. But I will hold my opinions very strongly until the point of being convinced that they're not the correct ideas. Maybe that's another aspect of this Tobi Tornado thing you talked about earlier, people do fight.

(00:53:27):
Again, the aesthetics of our times put a lot of stake into consistency. I remember various politicians losing campaigns because they were called flip-floppers at times, which I... Although, I'm more of a Maynard Keynes school of... "When the facts change, I change my opinion. What do you do, sir?" It sounds like a better OS to go by.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:52):
It's awesome, because I'm extracting more of your algorithm of how you think about stuff. A few things you just shared are, ( 1.), you need to be in the details. This is thinking about to be successful as a first principles thinker is (B.), you need to be in the details in your case code. In Elon's case, it's like, build the thing and be at the factory, sleeping on the floor. As you said, he's very Adams based. You're more digitally native. And then also, don't be so reliant on some costs. Like you said in this Tobi Tornado case, "I know you've been working on this project, we're going to kill it, because it's not going to work better if we do that now versus this. Just keep going, because we've been going." And then, coming back to the stuff you've shared previously is, analyze the path that you've been on, that the previous products and solutions have assumed the path dependence of them, and then don't look at what they've overfit potentially, that isn't correct. Love it. Okay. This actually is a good segue to something else that someone that you work with suggested I ask you, Farhan, your head of engineering. I asked him, "What's the best way to get a glimpse into Tobi's mind?" And it's actually along the lines of what you just described, which is, the question is just, what's the best way to disagree with you?

Tobi Lütke (00:55:02):
I think just disagree with me. I immediately love it, honestly. I really crave it. It's very funny. I know how this really surprises people. And I actually appreciate it even more because it requires courage, and frankly, I actually do find that... But it also makes me immediately trust the person more, partly because I, first of all, think they will do what they think is right rather than what is convenient. Agreeing with a group tends to be much more convenient. But more than that actually, that they're courageous enough to do it right then. I think courage is really, really rare. I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage. I found a lot more maybe even genius than courage. I like that. I wish it wouldn't require that. This is why I try to be very inviting of it.

(00:56:08):
When someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop and say, "Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement." And it's almost never, I find, in the, "I just feel like we should do this differently." What I'm looking for is offer unstated foundational assumptions. What is our divergence point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are, when it gets to this point, I found. Sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is incorrect. People tell me and then I'm so glad we talked about it, because I will stop forever nagging on this thing because now I know we can't do it because of Sarbanes-Oxley or something like this. It's just like, "Well, cool." My mental model of Sarbanes-Oxley, which is regulation for public companies, is not perfect. I have not in-depth studied all the details for it, so I will not consult this in my mind when I am saying, hey, we should solve the task at hand in a certain way. So, this is very good.

(00:57:24):
How to disagree? I really like debate. I will play devil's advocate actively if everyone agrees on something. Again, especially if a proposal is something that feels like I could have predicted would be a proposal before it got into the meeting and there was nothing surprising in it, I will make myself an end boss of a level and just say, "I'm going to say this is just not that good. I think we could do way better." I want people to then argue more in-depth for the veracity of the decisions, and that leads to a form of disagreement. I think all these things end up building trust.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):
I like that that touches also on this idea of, again, maximizing potential, the potential of the teams, the potential of the employees

Tobi Lütke (00:58:14):
Because of course, the really important decisions, we don't talk about. This is the most important thing. Shopify probably makes... What?... millions of decisions every day, like, write this code this way, yes, I'm going to add this unit test, maybe I'm skipping a unit test. Might be the difference between a future production audit. Millions and millions of these tiny decisions. So, you're not hiring engineers primarily or accountants, you're hiring people who make excellent decisions, given their specialization and areas they're overseeing. And given that, decision making as a concept is actually really understudied, I find.

(00:58:59):
I think these are instances where we can just learn to make decision making together. Because I think while a lot of decisions are made independently, we are a product company, we are on a mission, and we want our product to feel like something that a single person made, in the same way how any author tries to write a book that clearly reads that it came from one mind. Because people can see and spot this, if this doesn't happen. You end up with something that looks like a television remote, where there's a Netflix button over here... It's like you can reverse [inaudible 00:59:41] from the remote control. That's important.

(00:59:48):
Using these moments and also bringing decision making inwards to go and say, hey, let's have very efficient opportunities for as many people that can possibly get together, make decisions together, not as a democracy but with clear who needs to convince who. That because otherwise this ends up just taking way too long. Give a opportunity for everyone to change my mind over Glenn's mind, and so on, is an excellent practice, I find. I think this is a more optimal way of going about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):
Speaking of disagreeing, it reminded me of a story I heard, about the Tobi Tornado actually, the way you operate that. I love it. It ends up being this interesting microcosm of your first principle's way of thinking. The story is, I think you've said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to say something they disagree with on the internet.

Tobi Lütke (01:00:42):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
That's often the way you approach this is, you post in a Slack group, "Hey, I don't think this product is going to work, and here's why." And that ends up creating the most information for you. Is there anything along those lines that might be helpful to share?

Tobi Lütke (01:00:56):
I don't think that's one of my better ways of doing that. I have to be somewhat careful. The people I worked with a lot, I will do this, just because it's funny. But even I can see that that would seriously stress out the interns.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
You guys have a lot of interns. I think you have 1,000 interns this coming year, is what Farhan shared.

Tobi Lütke (01:01:20):
Yeah, we just started. I was in the office yesterday and it's absolutely full of interns. It's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Oh, man. Love interns, so much energy. This idea that you shared about building one product, building towards one vision, this actually reminds me of something that came up basically every time I had someone from Shopify on, which is this idea of a 100-year vision that you keep. I don't know of any other company that operates in this way, where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.

(01:01:48):
Can you just speak to that, of that way of operating, why you find that helpful, how that actually works?

Tobi Lütke (01:01:54):
I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot. What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this, or 10 or 5 years ago? What's the decision our future selves would want us to make, is useful. I find future casting to be generally extremely valuable. I definitely did not build Shopify to flip. I had lots of opportunities to sell Shopify to various people. I didn't consider it, because it's just too interesting of a journey and I think that's too... If a endpoint [inaudible 01:02:34] all companies is a convergence on a set of four or five people who can afford them, that just creates too much of a monoculture, I think, in thinking.

(01:02:43):
I like that Shopify is different. I think this is good. I think it's a terrible place to work for many, many, many people. It's the best place in the world to work for some people. That's so good. That's what we want, I think. We want more of this. We want people to be able to window-shop for a place where they can be enormously successful, because the place's set of beliefs just fits you like a glove.

(01:03:14):
100 years. We have very long-term plans. 100 years, you can't talk about this software product, but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically you make entrepreneurship more common. That is the thing we wanted to cause in the world. We have had, I think, success doing this already, but again, there's no speed limit and no stopping point for this. As I keep saying, the word's unbelievably path dependent. And therefore, if we are part of a path, we can cause it to be more in adherence to the things that we value and would like to see. This is the wonderful thing about company building. They can have lasting impact.

(01:04:16):
We are making decisions based on all the things that we can do. What are the things that will be most long-term valuable for the long-term pursuits we are on, and how can we normalize entrepreneurship? It's a thing that's really important to me, just because people don't spend enough time on it. It's all economics. Our [inaudible 01:04:44] living entirely depends on businesses. We are all part and tag of an environment that is extremely entrepreneurial and actually celebrates entrepreneurship as a courageous act and a glorious act even.

(01:05:02):
But that's not true in most of the world. In fact, most people never encounter anyone who engages in doing that. It's not something people see as one of their options. I want us to make these choices. And I think the long-term focus matters. It's also really powerful for decision making. And I know this is potentially intuitive to most, but also rarely practiced. You've had a lot of people from Stripe on here. Stripe and Shopify have had a very long-term partnership. Stripe and Shopify had potentially the most valuable partnership, or at least one of the top ones in history, of technology, because we were both very small companies and we decided, hey, let's work on an assumption that both of us are going to win our markets, and work together. So, Stripe's [inaudible 01:06:02] for payments and we're allowed a part of Stripe and so on.

(01:06:07):
When you're in a partnership like this, you play basically iterated prisoner's dilemma. Every instance, every turn you can make a choice: coordinate or defect, defecting if the other person collaborates, collaborator effect. If both collaborate, everyone gets a point. If one defects and the other one collaborates, you get a lot of points, all at one moment. Being a good partner in business is like this corporate marshmallow test that companies tend to fail in a very funny way.

(01:06:44):
If you see the videos of kids doing actual actual marshmallow tests, the smart ones actually turn the chair around, look away from the marshmallow, and sit on their hands, and just go vibrating. Because they know it's the right thing to wait for getting two marshmallows in the future, but man, if they just look at a marshmallow, they'll just eat it. Most CEOs, most companies can't even successfully do that and just engage in pulling future profits forward at a discount or even defecting on partnerships that would be much more long-term valuable.

(01:07:16):
If you're talking about long timeframes, like 100 years, there is no question. But clearly, the correct way to play iterated prisoner's dilemma is coordinate for both sides. It's way more valuable [inaudible 01:07:27] doing that over long periods of time than any momentary defection could possibly be convenient at a moment. It's a huge amount of product decisions. When we are deciding roadmap, end up being very influenced by this, because I get pitches for things we should do and why don't we do this kind of change to the system, there's so much money in it, and all these kind of things. I'm like, cool, but almost always come in a form of putting future profits forward at a discount.

(01:08:08):
But we have a long time horizon. Let's not take the discount, let's... Also, you often compromise the entire business after a while because you end up just... Your customers notice if you're going into value extraction. The best companies, I believe, at least from a perspective of a leader, resemble some kind of cockpit, or maybe a room full of dials or levers for monetization. My job is adding as many of these levers as possible to the room, and then not pulling any of them. Because I think we do best if we are on the same side of a table of our customers and we had them become entrepreneurs, which is a mission, and we want to support them to be more successful, which is the business model we are in. We get a very, very small stake of the sales in our monetization system. And therefore, we are incentivized to make everyone as successful as possible.

(01:09:11):
Again, when I get a PowerPoint from investment bankers or so, where they tell me I have enormous pricing power and I could massively change the prices, I'm like, "Yeah, but I'd leave Shopify if that happens to me, so how is that good?" He's just like, "Why?" It just goes like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:30):
There's a quote that you wrote somewhere that, to me, identifies this point so succinctly, "On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack." Yeah, beautiful.

Tobi Lütke (01:09:46):
I think that's pretty piffy and it's also just... Try to argue with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):
That's true.

Tobi Lütke (01:09:54):
Positive-sum games have incredible returns, especially in the worlds of software, where you can experience exponentials very easily. I see company building as... I wish there would be better analogy than chess, because chess is a game of perfect information, which is totally incorrect. But one thing which I like about chess as an analogy for business is that it basically is two games, that you have to be good at at both. There's a positional game that you learn: Develop your pieces, gain influence by your pieces over the board. That's really, really important. And then there's tactics, which you learn tactic training. You go get a puzzle trainer and you drill tactics and you learn the intuition to sports tactics, sense them. Both of them are actually super independent of each other.

(01:10:53):
The business world only talks about tactics. It only talks about the conversion of we did this thing. We did an A/B test and we changed the color of blue, and conversion red went up. We lionize the easy hack. I don't think that's important, honestly. You need to be good enough at tactics to not go out of business. You can't get margin code, sure. But the sum total of all the value of a potential tactics that you could employ stays with you if you are actually are doing the positional game.

(01:11:36):
The positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? Do they rely on you? Are you part of a team, or are you used as a tool in the toolbox, usually forgotten, sometimes coming out when certain task is being done? What does your product cover? What industries are you addressing? And so on, so on, so on. This is the positional game. How well do pieces fit together? Do people like relying even deeper on you?

(01:12:25):
If you do that well, the tactics are yours and you can hire a lot of people who are extraordinarily good at spotting tactics and using them. But if you do it too much, you end up extracting through tactics the entirety of the value that you have created and that is yours to take through a positional game. And if you do that, you have nothing left in the tank. That's for companies that we all see, that just got to a point and then just fade. Those are the companies that got tacticked out of their position.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):
The skill, obviously, is finding the balance between these two things of short-term, not get margin calls, as you described, but also think ahead.

(01:13:09):
Is there any kind of heuristic for founders listening to this who are like, "How do I do this? How much should I be thinking about the future versus now?", I guess? How do you try to create this pie chart of driving goals immediately and show investors we're killing it, while also thinking ahead?

Tobi Lütke (01:13:22):
Is there a good heuristic? Objective number one is: Don't die. Again, in the end, for companies that become historic companies are the ones which did not die. It also sounds very basic, but actually it's more actionable than it might seem. Past that point, I would argue: Just focus on the positional game. I think this is where a bit of a discrepancy of the founder and the rest of the company sometimes lies. I think the founders create finite, winnable games for people, that are very much serving the infinite game of developing, that the mission implies, the quality of position on the board.

(01:14:14):
By the way, it's an infinite board. Just picture the chess board as the initial terrain, but there's, I don't know, fog on the board and it's a terrain that's much larger that you will explore over time. I think that's the most prettiest way of mentally thinking about the experience of building a company. It's an exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission. And you will get to explore how correct your mission is and how good your decision making is along the way. And you get to learn a lot, and this is why I think it's a valuable thing to do.

(01:14:55):
But they often, the founders, and the mission of a company are in alignment, but they are, again, non-quantifiable things. They are pursuits. Maybe as time horizons that go past, all of our time horizons of our careers, therefore that makes it hard for people to care deeply yet. But they do care about the instances, the games along the way, the [inaudible 01:15:24] that have to be done to explore a part of a map, the tactics that have to be executed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:29):
I'm not going to take us here, but I know you're a big fan of this book, Finite and Infinite Games. I actually had it once at a book club and it blew my mind open. I'm going to link to it. People should check it out. You've talked about this on another podcast. I'm not going to [inaudible 01:15:40].

Tobi Lütke (01:15:40):
Yeah, it's a lovely book. James Carse did an incredible, underappreciated... I think they essentially wrote one of the best business books. They is trying to write a hard philosophy book. I don't know if it works for its intended purpose, but I think there's more value in what he actually accomplished. Maybe, sadly, it may be that he didn't know before he died, which would be very sad.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):
It's a little hard to read for people...

Tobi Lütke (01:16:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):
... so just stick with it and just try to wrap your head around what he's trying to say, is my advice.

Tobi Lütke (01:16:14):
I think reading... I don't know how many it is, but... the first couple of chapters really helps you get your arms around the story, his insight. The rest of the book are examples of his ideas applied. My takeaway from reading his examples is that he did not fully appreciate the insight of his own idea. It just ends up being very locally limited and very narrow-focused. It's a much grander idea than I think he really... This is why I say I don't think he fully appreciated quality of his own idea, which...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):
I think we need a Tobi version of this book, with a foreword, and...

Tobi Lütke (01:17:02):
I heard Simon Sinek...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):
Uh-huh.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:04):
... wrote a book of a similar title. I've actually never gotten around to read it, but I think he would be very good at interpreting this if that's what he did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
That's what it sounds like. I feel like his book is that book, written in a different way.

(01:17:15):
I want to come back to something you talked about, which is focusing on entrepreneurship and the merchants that you all work with. To me, this is another example of maximizing human potential. The way I think about this, people always talk about Y Combinator and Stanford and all these places that create all these companies and founders. If you think about it, Shopify does this orders of magnitude beyond, and I don't think you guys get enough credit for that, the amount of businesses you create, the amount of lives you change.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:43):
That's because we don't want the credit. That's the point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):
Is there a platform?

Tobi Lütke (01:17:47):
We don't want the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:47):
No.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:48):
I mean, maybe if you wanted it, you could also not get it, but we don't need to explore that because we actually, literally don't want the credit. Shopify is a company that pushes from behind. We don't want to be written into the story. We want to just...

Tobi Lütke (01:18:00):
... want to be written into the story, we want to just kind of have you do your thing. There's just too much grandeur in wanting to front it all. This is also what caused us to go and help people build their own things rather than start with a marketplace that everyone gets to lease a little component of at prices that corresponds to magically exactly your margin, as this usually goes in marketplaces. And so yeah, I think we don't want it. I'm proud of it, but that's intrinsic. I don't need very extrinsic appreciation for it, I suppose. There's millions, millions and millions of people that use Shopify daily and that represents the business and it causes major amount of employment around the world actually, definitely in North America specifically and Europe. And so I think that's really gratifying. I'm sure there's a way of saying that many of us businesses might actually have existed without Shopify.

(01:19:18):
I also think you can make a case that a good number exists because of Shopify, because what we've observed is that this was actually, it's my favorite thing in the entire Shopify journey that we sort of rigorously determined, which is that because I really, really, really prioritize good UX, legible interfaces. You can tame enormous complexity with great UX in a way that makes sense to people. I think this is actually almost a moral obligation to do for software because when software goes bad, it makes people feel dumb and machines do not get to negatively influence people in my mind. That is the inversion of the priority of the hierarchy of how machines are tools wielded by people to be more powerful at the things that they're already great at than they might imagine. That's when this all needs to fit together, but beyond the moral point, which is 10 years, and you could definitely take the other side of what we have determined is that every single time we make a complex thing simpler. It is actually that more businesses will exist on a platform.

(01:20:38):
So I think this is intuitive or at least directional, but sometimes people are not like, "Well, don't you just need to have all these features?" This is the RFP view of a world of software, right? "Don't you need to just have all the features then people can implement their plan?" Well, no. Think about the mental state and entrepreneurship entrepreneurs, they are, I mean especially if you're first entrepreneurs, they're unsophisticated. They don't know what to do. They're kind of scared. By the way, engaging in building something again is an act of pure courage and usually one which is very hard to hide from others. The people around you will know that you're doing this thing. Ask any entrepreneur. The amount of people who tell you to not do this is actually stunning. People do not want people to just step out of a box that exists that they sort of explain to themselves around them and have a chance of reaching higher because that would sort of invalidate their own life story in some meaningful way.

(01:21:38):
So there's actually a whole lot of nay saying that discourages people already, which is not super helpful. So now you have a situation where people are telling you to quit potentially, you don't have a lot of money presumably, you're asking yourself, are you even doing the right thing? Hopefully there's some elements of encouragement. Hopefully there's a passion. Hopefully you're trying to create a thing. Then comes to a situation that stuns you in some way, somewhere where suddenly the software starts talking about APIs where this is something you've never encountered in your life before or that just the option that you think it should have on the text configuration screen doesn't make sense given what we know about local taxes and so on. Here's the thing that happens. So the beautiful thing with Shopify is there's basically no tax configuration screen. It's just correct. The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity.

(01:22:53):
We know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks. On the wrong day, what that means, it's like they are going to close a browser and they say, "You know what? Fuck it. I'm not cut out for this." Or, "This piece of software I use sucks and it's too dumb for understanding the thing I have in my head," or something else. Everyone has a different rendering of the same thing, but just like progress stops. It is not just the businesses that shouldn't exist anyway that stop in this way. In fact, it's actually, and this is again what the data says, so many businesses get very close to this point many, many times. I can tell you Shopify did many times and I have more tools on entrepreneurial journey than most. I'm a computer programmer and I love those things. You tell me I can spend 14 hours programming for the next couple of years. I'm like, "Holy shit, let's go."

(01:24:01):
Most people aren't like that. So I've had unfair advantages that allowed me to overcome very technical climbs on this learning curve, but I know that's like most people can't have these advantages and therefore will churn out of a test. And so in other words, lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship. That is the best thing, the best answer to the most important question of my life that I've encountered because up to this point it was an intuition that doing the Shopify thing would be valuable in absolute sense, in a hundred-year sense. Afterwards I knew, right? And so that also just means now seeing things that are overly complex or shouldn't even be there, it's just physically painful because I know, it's like all these business that are trying to get somewhere and could exist and could now employ people and delight customers just died along the way because of something we did wrong or poorly and so on. And so this is a great source of energy for me to keep going.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:26):
I feel that, I feel that pain of the idea of anytime a button's broken or it's not as... the button's wrong color and more people would be converting means that you're not creating as many businesses, many entrepreneurs. The feeling you described of being scared to launch something, I exactly felt that when I started the newsletter. And my solution to that as I launched it is, "I'm just launching this as an experiment. We'll see where it goes, just don't worry about it. I might blog once in a while." And that really helped just lowering the stakes and I could see how just things like that and advice that can help someone get over that hump.

Tobi Lütke (01:26:01):
Yes, and I think this is an under explored thing in the word of UX. Random example, I was absolutely delighted by, maybe TikTok has the same thing, I don't know, but I was posting a video to Instagram and it allowed me to run a try run of the reel. It just seems like a new feature and just saying it shows it to a couple hundred people out of network and if they like it then it's going to post to my profile. I'm like, "I don't need that." But I thought that was one of the more... I honestly just closed Instagram and was like, "Holy shit, this is probably one of the most profound insightful pieces of software I've encountered. And as a connoisseur of good ideas, I've never had this as a valuable thing." It feels like a step function upgrade to the traditional A-B test as a concept because it's so understandable and I'm like, "What else in the world should have try runs that run out of network?" Basically everything, isn't it?

(01:27:03):
This is an amazing thing. Like I said, the rarest thing in the world, it's not even creativity or genius, it's courage. So let's lower the net amount of courage needed. Honestly, that's one of those things you can probably run an entire career or reinvent an industry on. These things unfurl into incredible amounts of value if you really pursue them and come at them from first principles rather than how can I do the things I want to do anyway slightly better because of insight. That's good and people should always do it, but not usually where most of the value ends up becoming, like manifests when a new idea comes around. So I talk radically about an Instagram feature. That's a weird thing to do, but I was actually just really to delighted because again, it just came up a few days ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:54):
I love this thread of courage. The example you gave reminds me also of I feel like going on a dating app at a different city for the first time is another example of this where it's a dry run, nobody knows you.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:06):
But even then, shouldn't there be like, "Hey, post my profile to a different city for telling me if it's any good."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):
SO people like it.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:14):
I mean I've never dated basically so I mean at least not in the last 25 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
Yeah, of the podcast.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:20):
So I'm pre swipe left and right dating, so my conception is very low of this. Maybe I should look more at dating apps. I'm pretty sure there's some amazing UX in most things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):
I imagine. I feel like dating is going offline more and more. I'm feeling like that's what people are trying to do. They're tired of the swipe, but anyway, going to go in that direction. Maybe a couple more questions while I have you here. One is this idea of the talent stack. You've mentioned this concept before and this is the term that I've seen you describe it as of this idea of the power of focusing on your unique talents and curiosity and that leading you to the biggest opportunities, especially early in your career. Can you just talk about what your insight there.

Tobi Lütke (01:29:04):
Yeah, again, I only lived one life, so I can't Monte Carlo all the decisions I make and just figure out which ones ended up being load baring, right? I'm at this point pretty amused by the following thing which keeps happening. But I am getting curious about some absolutely random thing and it really is fairly far-flung stuff and like magic it becomes the way that ends up allowing me to make a very important choice a year later. It's ends up being a better analogy that I've learned or a different way to see something or another idea that I found being represented in this area of expertise that is actually just again, another repackaging of another foundational idea, which allows me to go and look for more examples.

(01:29:57):
And it's just funny this way. So even early in career just I followed my curiosity. I love programming and I love computers and I loved the internet when it came along and I just like, "Cool, I'm going to find a task that I find valuable," which I was always engaged in retail and I have a lot to say about how retail should be brought by the internet to people. But this is a beautiful intersection of all the things that I find interesting. And then on top of it, I found Ruby, which I loved as a technology and then just now I was highly motivated to tinker, explore a space that was clearly emerging but just felt very obviously of value in the future.

(01:30:44):
But I didn't do it because I was following money. I did it because I like learning by doing stuff and I like tinkering the things and so this was a way of financing my tinkering by selling snowboards and then it led to other things. And I've kind of been doing that thing all along. It's great fun, great fun for me. I don't know how much of a advice that is, but maybe a proof point that can work really well. I sometimes worry though that things like this end up being a little bit like all you need to do is buy a lottery ticket, set for lottery ticket winner, right? So it's, who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):
It does resonate. It reminds me of something Brian Armstrong once shared, which is the reason that he-

Tobi Lütke (01:31:37):
He's also, by the way, you have to add him to the set of first principle thinkers if you're starting to cultivate one. And I think there's plenty of startup success, successful founders, CEOs, especially for public companies are surprisingly alike in this projecting slightly different, maybe coming from different backgrounds, but Brian is extraordinarily strong at this [inaudible 01:32:06] by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):
Okay, here's to the next nominated for the podcast, Brian. We'll get on it. But interestingly, he had basically exact same advice for what allowed him to create Coinbase is his background was economics, coding and cryptography or something along those lines. And it's the Venn diagram, is like, "This is the thing I'm uniquely strong at and have an opportunity to win it."

Tobi Lütke (01:32:29):
Yeah. So this is what we very actively tell our customers, right? There's a 2005 essay by Kevin Kelly saying, "In the future on the internet you just need a thousand true fans." It's what the internet and I think what Shopify celebrates, that instead of trying to create toothpaste, which is of course a huge term but hard to differentiate. It's much better to figure out a triplicate intersection of three different things and nail it. We took a winter vacation with my boys and my family in the Caribbean and I like playing poker with them. I like playing poker and it's great limited information game. I think this were valuable for kids and so I found this, I might have mentioned this in some place, but I found this pirate gold I think it's called.

(01:33:32):
It's just amazing poker set, poker chips that look like they come right out of the treasure chest or in Pirates of the Caribbean. Think about just the intersection, so this is online Texas Hold'em, quality poker set instead of... because you can play with just anything, right? People were in the market for spending money on something like this and pirate themed. You're like, " But I'm such a big fan, I'm telling you about it and people might actually purchase it because I'm enthusiastic about it." And because enthusiasm is actually the best marketing and they have at least a thousand true fans, and it's just better to make amazing things for some people than make something that everyone wants maybe or would tolerate. And I think that's really, really good. So I think that works for your career too because by the way, we are all entrepreneurs so we're ready to think about any career.

(01:34:36):
If you actually ask me for career advice is we are products, we are engaged in entrepreneurship, we are basically software as a service if you want, or talent as a service. We are selling a subscription in the form of our employment we call it, but it's actually just rebranded the subscription frankly because it comes some extra protection, which is very good, but it's still the same thing, it's a double opt-in company. Like you would say, I can do these things and I will be of significantly more value to the company than you will have to spend on me. There's like a positive ROI ideally for a company and a company either says, "I agree or I don't agree with you." And that's actually what employment is. So I think people should think about themselves as a product. Your career is not based on mentors you find or getting a promotion or not.

(01:35:34):
It's about what are you too good to ignore in? How good can you be? Can you be absolutely work? Can you be excellent? I mean you don't have to be work class and stuff, but you have to... Ideally you find a thing where you are just in this sort of tiny space of five intersections or so versus we just know more than everyone else and then everyone calls you. Like I said, we use Ruby. Ruby was not that fast. Shopify would rather have it very fast. We found people who got PhDs in dynamic language, garbage collection dynamic language, just in time compilation to make Ruby fast. And they're having delightful time at Shopify and Shopify is now very fast and it's very good. And everyone gets to profit from us needing this because we merged it back into Ruby Core and now everyone can have a JIT compiler. So it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):
I feel like every story is a fractal into other hours of other podcast conversation we can have. I know you have to go run this nine, 10, 10,000 person company and do real work. So I'm going to end it there. We got through almost everything I was hoping to get through, but there's infinitely more questions I still have. Just to maybe end it, is there anything you want to leave listeners with? Any last nugget that maybe you didn't mention?

Tobi Lütke (01:37:03):
If I get to talk to again people who look at product and product management, here's my thing that I think maybe only implicitly came through in all this. Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product. And it is not possible to make great products if the people work on it do not give a shit about the product. And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that the team gives a shit. And I think this is something that can be done with building empathy for people using it, but also it can be done infectiously by the product leader. The product leader has to give a shit. Do not engage in product work on product that you don't care about because you cannot produce the thing that the person will give you a task is looking for.

(01:38:04):
And I think again, so much goes into this unquantifiable conversation which we already had, but boy is that important because it just isn't about the brief document, it isn't about the aligning stakeholders. Sometimes in some places some of those things are aspects of it and I think they correlate sometimes with people. But I think the higher order bit is if you are in product, you have basically free roads. You have to have the team sits, look around corners that they don't see. You just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else because that's a role. Now, you don't have to do this by yourself. Everyone on the team is of a resource to you and you can query them and therefore determine what is around the corners and so on. But in engineering and UX and so on, but that's very important. Second is you've got to be exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing because just that one thing alone will make a 10 times better product. It's crazy how much of a change this makes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):
I feel like honestly what you're describing here is like founder mode, what the outputs are. Giving a shit, being exothermic excited and looking around corners. I feel like this is its own conversation here.

Tobi Lütke (01:39:37):
Yeah, I agree. I don't think founder mode, so I mean I think, yeah, founder mode is a super valuable term, but I actually do think that I answered the question about what I think about founder mode in the discussion about pumping heat into systems. That's what I do. It's just that founder mode in a founder run company, I think this has an easier time existing because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing. People fight them, people probably take them out, and if the boss is like this, boss can protect the other people like this. And therefore I think founder run companies can be innovative longer because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing for a long time. So anyway, that's my tear down on the founder mode discussion, which I think is a really fascinating recent discussion. I find it's very valuable. I'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways, but I think it's more actionable than people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:40):
Tobi, I appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets, even though I know you have to go, by the way, your video looks incredible right now. This is amazing editing, we're doing like a rainbow streaming across your body.

Tobi Lütke (01:40:53):
Yeah, we really hit the rainbows here like, "Let's go and invent." I hope you've got to gold that you were hoping and-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):
So much gold.

Tobi Lütke (01:41:00):
... I was sufficient leprechaun here to deliver.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:05):
What a metaphor. Okay, Tobi, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I feel like this is going to help so many people build great companies and thank you from first principles.

Tobi Lütke (01:41:13):

# A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)

## Transcript

Todd Jackson (00:00:00):
Finding product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years, and it's just underexplored and it's just underexplained as a topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
You've been working on a product-market fit framework.

Todd Jackson (00:00:11):
We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review, and we have found a very consistent set of patterns, demand satisfaction, and efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them from the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
There's essentially four levels of product-market fit: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:00:27):
Roughly, 60% are never going to get past L2.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:29):
These four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck.

Todd Jackson (00:00:34):
You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Hearing level three tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding, selling, pitching.

Todd Jackson (00:00:47):
This is where it starts to get fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
Today my guest is Todd Jackson. Todd is a partner at the legendary VC firm, First Round Capital. I rarely have VCs on this podcast, but as Todd shares at the top of this episode, Todd is a very special VC. Prior to moving into venture, he was product lead for Gmail for four years. He was product manager of Facebook's newsfeed, photos and groups, including leading a major redesign of the newsfeed. He's also a director of product management at Twitter and VP of product and design at Dropbox.

(00:01:21):
He's also a founder and sold his company to Twitter. This episode is a very different and special kind of episode. Todd and the team at First Round have spent the last year looking at all of their data and the journeys of the hundreds of startups that they've worked with over the years. And through that, have put together a very practical and very actionable framework to help founders find product-market fit. They're turning this framework into a three-month program for founders, and in this conversation, Todd shares an exclusive peek into the program, in particular, the stages of product-market fit.

(00:01:55):
We talk about how to know which stage you're in, what to do if you're stuck in that stage, and also what you can change in order to get unstuck. If you're a founder or building a new product within a company and feeling like you're not making as much progress as you'd hope, you will find tremendous value in this conversation. With that, I bring you Todd Jackson after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:02:26):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.

(00:02:56):
WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand. It's an effortless experience from your first user, all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to one million users. Check it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more. That's workos.com/lenny.

(00:03:32):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

(00:04:12):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10 X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny. Todd, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Todd Jackson (00:04:56):
Lenny, I'm excited to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
So first of all, just to mention you're a VC, which is very rare for this podcast. But you're a very special VC, you have a deep background in product, and I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of context on your product background, your product bona fides so people will get a real sense of just how legit you are as a product thinker.

Todd Jackson (00:05:17):
Yeah, you got it. So I am a VC. I'm a partner at First Round Capital now, and I've been at First Round for four years. But I was not a VC before First Round. So I started a company in 2013 called Cover, and that was actually funded by First Round 11 years ago. That's how I got to know First Round. And before that, I had worked on Gmail as the product lead in the early days, early 2000s and at Facebook.

(00:05:39):
And then I started Cover, and we ended up selling Cover to Twitter in 2014. And I worked on a bunch of different products at Twitter. And then I was the VP of product and design at Dropbox. That was 2015 to 2018. So I have always loved product, and that's actually the reason now that I love being a seed stage VC because I love investing at the early stage founders who are pre-product-market fit and then helping them get there. And I just love doing that over and over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:07):
I feel like we could have a whole other podcast episode on why you decided to move into venture versus staying in product.

Todd Jackson (00:06:12):
We can do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):
But we're going to stay focused. So the reason we're here is that for over a year, you've been working on a product-market fit framework, essentially, a framework to help founders and product teams find product-market fit, which we should talk about this. But this is the most important thing you've got to get right as a founder in a product team is finding product-market fit. I got a peek at this framework. I love it. I love the way you've structured it, the way you're thinking about it.

(00:06:36):
So what we're going to do today is walk through this framework in depth. First, I just want to spend a few minutes on setting a little context just so people understand who this is for and how to think about this. So maybe a first question is just why do you believe people need a framework for finding product-market fit? And just also, if you want to touch on why is product-market fit so important? Why is that something people should even be thinking about?

Todd Jackson (00:06:57):
The thing about product-market fit is that I find it's mysterious to a lot of people, and people tend to think about it purely as an art rather than a science. And all the advice that you find out there on the internet is very general when it comes to product-market fit. You'll know it when you see it, you'll know it when you have it. It's not specific. And there's so many other startup topics where there is good content on the internet like hiring your first salesperson, running board meetings, stuff that is specific and tactical. But there isn't that much content around product-market fit that is that specific.

(00:07:33):
And so I think that's actually why Rahul from Superhuman is well-known for his approach to finding product-market fit. That was published on the First Round Review in 2018, and it was immediately popular and interesting to people. And I think the reason is because it was specific and because it was tactical and it brought a little bit of the science to something that people thought was just an art. And I think it's why your content is really popular too, Lenny.

(00:07:57):
You and I worked on this product validation article together a little while back, and the seven part series that you did on B2B SaaS companies and the PMF benchmarking data that you had, I think it was how long it took to get to a product and a customer and to product-market fit, that was super well-read. And there just isn't that much good specific content about this. But like you said, product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years and it's just underexplored, it's underexplained as a topic.

(00:08:28):
So we felt this was a very important thing to do, something worth focusing on. And I've personally talked to hundreds of founders about this topic. We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review. We call this our Paths to Product-Market Fit Series where we interview founders about the early days. And I'm just always interested in what are the patterns. If you talk to enough successful founders, and in this case, it can be enterprise founders, and you ask them, "What did you do in the first six to nine months of running your company, of starting your company? What patterns emerged from that?" And we have found a very consistent set of patterns, and that's what we decided to base our framework around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):
Amazing. And I think you're at such an interesting Venn diagram of exposure to develop something like this. One, you have a deep product background, you started a company, you see tons of startups going through the journey, many succeeding, many not. So I get why one, you wanted to do this and why I think this is going to be so valuable to a lot of people. You talked briefly about why product-market fit is so important, and maybe it might be helpful just to share a little bit more just why is this something people should be so obsessed with and why did you spend so much time developing this?

Todd Jackson (00:09:40):
I think as a founder, there are so many things you have to do. You have to pick a market, you have to find a co-founder, you have to hire a team, you have to raise funding, you have to build a product, you have to sell a product. And so sometimes it gets lost that actually, the only thing that matters in the first couple years is finding product-market fit and actually, what we define as extreme product-market fit, and I'll go into that. Because if you find extreme product-market fit, the momentum just carries you, and the market pulls you along. And it's easy to know what to build because you're building the thing that your customers want and it's motivating as a team. It's easy to hire people, everything becomes easier if you find product-market fit, it is the thing that propels the company.

(00:10:25):
And so we are a seed stage venture firm. We tend to work with very early founders who are pre-product-market fit. And the hard truth about it is that most of them don't get past the first couple levels of it. The majority of startups do not get past, what we call, level one product-market fit or level two product-market fit. And I'll go through and define all that stuff. They get stuck at one of those first couple levels. And if they can unlock the right product and the right way to explain it to a customer and make a customer deeply satisfied, and there's enough customers out there like that, it just pulls the whole thing along.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
Who is this framework for specifically? And for people that are listening, how do they know if this is for them or not?

Todd Jackson (00:11:07):
This is for early B2B founders, and specifically founders who are doing something that is more sales-led than bottom-up. I think bottom-up is its own world. It's closer to consumer product development in my mind. And I have done consumer products. Consumer product, I think there is a little bit more alchemy involved. It's about having great taste and finding the right thing at the right time and it's like catching lightning in a bottle.

(00:11:36):
I think the good thing about enterprise, and specifically sales-led B2B, is that there is more science to it. And so it is for sales-led B2B founders who are in, let's call it, the first six to nine months of starting their company and want to set the foundation for product-market fit right from the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):
Awesome. Okay. So B2B founders, sales-led in the first six to nine months of their journey. Awesome.

Todd Jackson (00:11:59):
That's right. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
You talked about the science of this. I imagine you don't want to overpromise this is going to help you find product-market fit, step one, two, three profit. How do you think about just what the benefits of this are and how people should think about the chance that they will find product-market fit at the end of this journey following this framework?

Todd Jackson (00:12:16):
We can't guarantee success here. I just want to contextualize that finding extreme product-market fit is very, very hard. And what we are trying to do is increase your odds, increase the odds, reduce the role of luck, give you a framework and way of thinking about the things that you need to do. And I think that that can increase the odds. Like I said earlier, the majority of startups are getting stuck at these first couple levels. I think if you know what the path looks like and you know what the levers are at your disposal and you know what you need to aim for, I think we can get more of these companies to level three and level four product-market fit, which is where you really want to be and where you have a very valuable company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:54):
Perfect. Okay, final question. You launched a whole program for founders to go through and learn all of this in depth, many week kind of program. We're going to be covering a lot of it here for folks that want to go a lot deeper and actually go through this program. Talk about how they find this and how this program works.

Todd Jackson (00:13:11):
So we launched a new program, and we call it Product-Market Fit Method. It is designed, like I said, to help early B2B founders increase the odds of finding product-market fit. It's totally free, it's a very intensive program. You can see all the details at pmf.firstround.com, and the application deadline is May 7th. The program starts on May 29th. And we actually ran a beta version, a test version of this late last year with 11 founders, I think probably some you know, Lenny, from Stripe and Plaid and Airbnb and Twitter. And the feedback, it was great. It made me feel very good.

(00:13:47):
One of the founders was like, "I feel like these 14 weeks saved me two years of time in what would've been wandering through the desert." And so there's eight sessions in the full program, and the first one is the one we're going to do today. So the first session is on what we call the levels of product-market fit. The second one is on customer discovery, and we actually refer to it as dollar-driven discovery. We get very specific about not just the normal way of doing customer conversations and customer discovery, but how do you find that a customer is willing to pay money for this thing and a lot of money?

(00:14:22):
We talk about market validation, product positioning. We do a section on design partners because I think a lot of founders have questions about that. How do I find the right design partners? What's the right way to structure an agreement with them? How do I convert them to paying customers? All that stuff. We talk about product iteration and pivots, and I refer to this stage as the grind, the grind of product iteration. And then we spend a ton of time on founder-led sales.

(00:14:47):
And the reason that we do that is we really like working with very technical founders, builders, people that are either engineering background, product design, data science, people who are builders. So that's the program in a nutshell. And like I said, any founder working on a new B2B SaaS company, welcome to apply. And then bonus points if you are technical, like I said, if you have a clear product idea or a hypothesis, but that you're less than six to 12 months into building the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
I love how incentives are so aligned here. You help companies find product-market fit. If First Round does great, everyone does great. It makes so much sense to build something like this. One thing I can't help but mention or ask about is you said it's an intensive program. How do you find founders have time to do something like this and also be building their company? I know this helps them build, but how do you just think about they have so much to do, they have time to do a program like this?

Todd Jackson (00:15:41):
The way that we think about it is that the program roughly takes about 10 hours a week for each founder, and it's 10 hours of work that you were going to be doing anyway. It is literally you're talking to customers, you're improving your positioning, you're doing critical thinking about your market and what you should be building. And so the way I think about it, and the way I've heard from the 11 founders that went through it is it just added structure to what I was doing anyway and it actually made me more efficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):
Last question, you mentioned that it's free. How does that work? How does that work for everyone?

Todd Jackson (00:16:14):
So it's 100% free and literally, it costs you $0. We give you $0, we own 0% of your company. And it's pretty different than I think a lot of other programs out there. And this is just something we do. Over the years, we've run First Round Angel Track, which I know you were in, Lenny. We've run the First Round Review for 10 years. We make these things free and our belief is that you have to create value in the ecosystem.

(00:16:36):
You have to put stuff out in the world that is useful, and if you can create that value, create enough value with the audience, then you'll be able to capture that value at some point. And so we think there's a win-win here. We get an inside look at some of tomorrow's great companies and they get an inside look at First Round.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:49):
Got it. So companies don't have to take money from you guys to be a part of this program.

Todd Jackson (00:16:53):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
Okay, let's get into it. Let's talk about this framework. Maybe just as a broad strokes overview, how does this framework work? How do companies find product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:17:03):
So the framework starts with a very simple idea that is product-market fit is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and it doesn't just happen overnight. And for B2B companies, specifically, it does tend to follow a repeatable pattern. And so we start with defining the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to get to extreme product-market fit. And we have a precise definition for this. Let me read it to you. So extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.

(00:17:40):
And so there's three key ideas in there: demand, satisfaction and efficiency. And I think efficiency is worth highlighting because that's what most people would leave out of their definition. You talk about like, "Oh, it's a product, people like it. That's good, that's product-market fit." But if you look, there's products out there. I was a big fan of WeWork, as a customer of WeWork. And I'm a fan of Casper and these other products. Those products managed to achieve customer satisfaction and demand, but they never got the efficiency right, and so the whole business just never worked at scale.

(00:18:18):
And my partner, Brett Berson, at First Round, he gives this example of the $100 vending machine, and I really like this example, which is imagine I built a vending machine and I stuck it in the middle of San Francisco. And you walk up to this vending machine and you put a dollar in and $100 bill comes out. And that's the product. That would have insane demand. There would be a line at that vending machine. I think people would be extremely satisfied. They'd be like, "This is awesome." The retention would be very good. I'm sure they would come back tomorrow. But the whole thing is it's ridiculous. The whole metaphor is ridiculous because it's just not viable to do something like that.

(00:18:59):
And yet you see a lot of startups kind of do this. They're basically with their products, giving away $2 for $1 and it gets them pretty far. But that's not real product-market fit. And so that's one of the reasons that we think efficiency and how you think about the economic model of what you're doing is very important. And then this other aspect that I like, which is we have this concept that we call the marginal customer, and the next incremental customer you're going to get for your company, for your product. And if you have product-market fit, and as you are progressing along this journey, the marginal customer should be getting easier and easier and easier to get, easier to acquire them, easier to give them good service with a good product.

(00:19:42):
And that means your efficiency is increasing along the way and your product-market fit is strengthening. So you've got to have all three of those things: demand, satisfaction, efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them at once from the very beginning. And so product-market fit, it happens in the sequence of levels, it happens over multiple years. And for the best enterprise companies, I would say they tend to reach extreme product-market fit in roughly four to six years. There's some variance, but roughly four to six years. And so we label these four levels. We say level one product-market fit is nascent product-market fit. Level two is developing, level three is strong, and level four is extreme. And that's where you want to get.

(00:20:26):
And along the way, you're trading off these three dimensions: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency because they're intertwined. You could spend a bunch of money on marketing, and that's going to increase your demand, but you're decreasing your efficiency if you do that. You can invest a bunch in efficiency and automating a whole bunch of stuff, but that actually might harm the customer experience and you're reducing satisfaction. So that's an interesting thing, I think, is you're actually making trade-offs at each level and what you should optimize for at each level is different. And so we talk about all these signs, whether you're getting stuck at a given level, how do you get unstuck and how do you progress along this path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
Amazing. And we're going to go through each of these. And the idea, as a listener, what I'm thinking is you're probably in one of these buckets. What we're trying to do is help you out of that bucket and help you move further up the ladder to the next level. So just to summarize, I have my notes here. So there's essentially four levels of product-market fit, basically, the strength of product-market fit that you have: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:21:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):
Okay. And then you have three dimensions within each of these levels: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. We're going to talk about what all these mean and how you use these. Let's talk about level one, nascent product-market fit. What does that look like? What do you do when you're there if you're stuck? And what are some examples of companies that felt nascent product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:21:44):
Yeah. Okay, level one, nascent. So at this point, you're probably like a pre-seed or seed stage company. You've got less than 10 people on your team. And at level one, your job is to find three to five customers that have a particular problem that is worth solving and to deliver them a satisfying solution. And you got to pick a problem that is both important and urgent to them.

(00:22:08):
And the solution that you deliver needs to satisfy some kind of promise that they care deeply about. So of the three dimensions that you just recapped, Lenny, it's satisfaction first, demand second, efficiency last when you're at level one. It's actually okay to be inefficient at this stage if it helps you uncover something that delivers an insanely good customer satisfaction. And so I think that one of the best examples I can think of that is this company called Vanta.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
Love Vanta. Also, a happy sponsor and I'm an investor. What a great example.

Todd Jackson (00:22:42):
What a great example. So Vanta was founded in 2016 by Christina Cacioppo, and she had come from Dropbox and we got to work at Dropbox together, which was awesome. She was the PM of Dropbox Paper at that time. And so Vanta, it's a company that does compliance automation, continuous monitoring. And most startups think of Vanta is how you get a SOC 2, but they didn't do that at first.

(00:23:03):
And I remember in 2018, Christina and I went on a walk around the South Park neighborhood in San Francisco. And this was the first time I heard the idea of Vanta. And she had actually, in 2016, 2017, tried a few other ideas. She had this smart speaker that would record meetings and it would send meeting summaries over Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):
B2B Alexa is what she called it. I remember.

Todd Jackson (00:23:25):
B2B Alexa. And she had this other idea, something about dropshipping, but she didn't know anything about dropshipping. And she had just been in this mode of like, "We're building stuff and then we're seeing if anybody wants it." And then she realized that wasn't working and she changed what she was doing. And she started talking to potential customers, and she was very interested in the idea of security and why a lot of startups didn't use any security products.

(00:23:48):
And she was talking to security engineers and CISOs and just CTOs and startups. And she would ask them, "What is the thing you hate most about your job as it relates to security?" And over and over and over they would say, "I hate filling out the security questionnaires. I hate doing the compliance audits. It's so much grungy manual work. I'm in there filling out spreadsheets and taking screenshots of my AWS account. And the whole thing just doesn't make sense." And she had actually felt this herself when she was on Dropbox Paper and the experience of getting a SOC 2 was onerous.

(00:24:26):
And the reason that she needed to get it is because we wanted to start selling Dropbox Paper into enterprise. And so she said to me, "There's this pain out there, I think I can solve it, and I think there might be a revenue unlock." And I was like, "What do you mean by that?" And she was like, "Well, I've got these first few customers or design partner, pseudo customers. It's Segment and Front and Figma." And this is 2017, '18. So these companies were smaller at the time, not the big companies they are now. And she was like, "Yeah, they're trying to sell into Fortune 500 companies. One of them is actually trying to land a Fortune 10 right now. And they said the thing that's holding them back is they don't have compliance certification, they don't have a SOC 2.

(00:25:08):
"And I told them, 'Hey, what if I do that for you?' And they were like, 'Oh, you can just do that?'" And she was like, "Yeah." And she did it, and they landed the deal. And it's one of the clearest examples to me of a product that satisfies a promise, but this product is going to unlock revenue for you. You are going to be able to land this enterprise deal. And so I think they just did a phenomenal job of that. And that's what you're looking for when you're at level one, a problem that really matters to three to five customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
That specific example, I think she delivered a spreadsheet. There was no product, she just manually filled out a spreadsheet and gave it to them.

Todd Jackson (00:25:49):
Completely manual. She was the one behind the email address posing as the AI, but doing it herself. And I think that's revealing of it's okay to be inefficient at level one, as long as you are delivering incredible satisfaction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Yeah, I was just going to say that. This is the ultimate example of efficiency is not important, which I love, is what you're pointing out at this step. I know you're going to share another example, but just to summarize what this stage feels like from earlier when you talked about, essentially, of less than 10 people, you're trying to find three to five customers. I think that's so important. You're not trying to find tens or hundreds, you're just like, "Three to five people." And the customer element, I imagine, you're implying they're paying you money.

Todd Jackson (00:26:29):
Yes, they're paying you money and you're delivering a product that solves a problem for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
And the product could be potentially a spreadsheet or super Wizard of Oz at this point even.

Todd Jackson (00:26:37):
Yeah, that's okay at this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):
I know RAMP actually had barely a product when they started selling. Initially, they had someone just updating things behind the scenes on these dashboards. And then you talked about the problem needs to be important and urgent, which connects to people paying attention to a startup that they don't trust or know anything about because the problem is that important and urgent. And you also mentioned it has to satisfy a promise you're giving them, "We'll solve SOC 2 for you," and then you actually accomplish that.

Todd Jackson (00:27:03):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):
Is there anything else maybe as a benchmark that tells you you're at this step of product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:27:10):
Yeah. So like I said, you're pre-seed less than 10 people. Probably, your demand source at this stage is mostly people you know. It's friends and family, it's your network, maybe it's VCs. You haven't probably done a lot of cold outreach at this point, and it's hard to find customers. You're trying to get three to five. It probably takes you 20 warm intros to get one, something along those lines. So maybe to get to three to five, it's at least 50 conversations. That's very normal at this stage because you're just trying to find the right problem and find customers who have it. You're probably in the $0 to 500K ARR, somewhere in that zone. I would say that you're at level one.

(00:27:48):
And then there are metrics to track efficiency, things like burn multiple, gross margin, NRR all of these things. All of them are just not applicable at this stage. It's too early and you shouldn't be worrying about that stuff. And so you want to be feeling this sense of progress that there are customers who need what you are building and the thing you're building works. And so conversely, the signs that we see a lot of founders get stuck, and this is a very common level to get stuck. And so if you're hanging out here for six months, nine months, 12 months, and there's yellow flags that are appearing, you're starting to feel stuck.

(00:28:24):
And so the yellow flags are something like, let's say, your product disappeared overnight, your customers wouldn't be super disappointed. Let's say you have a handful of happy customers. Let's say you've got four or five customers, but the most important feature is actually different for each one of them. That starts to look a little bit more like a consulting business than a product business. Or it just feels incredibly hard to find the marginal customer, the next new customer. Or your usage is low. The product is in their hands, but the usage is low, it's not growing that much. It lasts for six months.

(00:28:55):
And I think, there's a really good example, Jack Altman, who's the founder of Lattice, he founded Lattice in 2015. We've talked to him a bunch on the First Round Paths to Product-Market Fit and other things. So for those who don't know, Lattice is a people management platform, but it didn't start that way. And most people don't know about this, Lattice actually started as an OKR tool back in 2015.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:15):
Oh, didn't know.

Todd Jackson (00:29:16):
Yeah. And so Jack had just seen this at other companies. He's like, "Okay, companies are doing OKRs, but they're not very good at it and it causes a lot of arguments among the executive team and employees are noncompliant. They think the whole thing's dumb. So I can fix that with software." And so the original version of Lattice was for managing OKRs. And he was able to sell it. And so his buyer was the head of HR, and they said, "Okay, yeah, we'll give this a shot." And he had a couple companies using it, and they would use it for one quarter. And then the next quarter would come around, and they were like, "Didn't go that well last time. I don't know, the employees don't seem to like it. I don't know."

(00:29:59):
And then the quarter after that, they were like, "No, we're not buying this, we're not using this." And so Jack pulled off the pivot to people management. And the way that he did it was he actually kept the persona. And so this gets into the ideas of the four Ps, and I'll talk about this a little bit more. This is our version of the four Ps. You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. And all four of these things have to line up. Your product has to deliver a promise that solves the problem of your persona. And so Jack actually kept the persona. He was like, "I've gotten to know these heads of HR really well over the last six to nine months. I text with them, I go out to coffee with them, I'm friends with them, I know them really well. This OKR thing just doesn't seem to be a big deal for them, but they've got other problems that I could look at solving."

(00:30:53):
And the interesting thing was that timing, it was mid-2010s, performance management had started to come back in favor. It was like this pendulum. There was a period of time where performance management was really important, and then all these companies were like, "We're not doing this anymore." And then the pendulum swung back, and around 2015, 2016 was that time. And so Jack literally showed them Figma mock-ups. There was no product, but he's like, "What if I could solve performance management for you in a way that is much more modern and much more employee-friendly and manager-friendly and the whole thing's just going to work better?"

(00:31:25):
And the response was off the charts. And people wanted this thing. And I believe he sold his first five or 10 customers with Figma mock-ups. Before, he hadn't built anything really. And so that, I think, is an interesting example of he was stuck in the zone of people didn't love what he was doing. He kept the persona, but he changed the problem that he was solving and the promise he was delivering through the product. And we do a whole section on pivots and when to pivot and how to pivot. And I think this is actually the best framework for this, is the four Ps. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

(00:32:08):
There are other products like Plaid that actually kept elements of the product they were doing. So I don't know if you know the story of Plaid, but Zach Perret was building... Plaid started out not as like a API for bank accounts. It started out as a consumer budgeting app. It was a consumer app. And it just was supposed to help you save money and budget and stuff. And it just wasn't that popular. And the founders were frustrated, but they had built this part of the product that enabled the app to connect to your bank accounts, and had solved all the nitty-gritty issues with that. And then they found that their friends wanted to license it from them.

(00:32:46):
So Zach had a friend at Venmo who wanted to license this, and they got Robinhood at some point, they got Coinbase at some point. So that's an example of they actually kept a lot of the code that they had written. They kept the product, but they completely changed the other three Ps. Instead of solving for consumers who have a problem with budgeting, we are going to solve for developers at fintech companies who have a problem connecting to bank accounts. And it was a total flip of the four Ps. But that's why I really like this framework because I think it really helps founders think in a structured way about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
Todd, this is amazing. I'm so happy we're doing this. I think this is going to help a lot of people. I want to move on to level two, but first let me try to summarize some of these key elements. So these four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck in this level or any level. And just to summarize, you can change who you're targeting, the persona, you can change the problem you're solving, you could change the way you're pitching it, which is the promise is how you describe it, basically positioning. And then you could also just change your product. You mentioned Vanta changed all four, some companies change just one. Any advice for how to know which of these to change? What points you to change this versus change that? Is there anything that you've seen?

Todd Jackson (00:33:55):
I think different founders approach this differently. And I've seen a lot of founders who are build first and then sell, and I've seen a lot of founders who are sell first and then build. And they can both work. I tend to gravitate towards the, "I want to sell it before I build it," because I really want the signal from customers and I want that to be the guide and the oxygen that drives what I'm building. I find that very motivating. I also find it easier, honestly.

(00:34:25):
Rather than guessing like, "Oh, I'm going to write 50,000 lines of code and then see if somebody wants this thing," I think it's better to talk to a bunch of customers, know that, "Hey, if I had this thing, if I could build this thing, I know it would sell. I know these people want this thing." So I tend to approach it from that point of view and therefore, I focus on the persona and the problem and the promise. What is the promise that is really going to click for that buyer, for that persona? And then the product's job is to satisfy those first three Ps really.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:55):
And obviously, those are much easier to change and play with versus rebuilding your product. So if nothing else, you should probably start there. I actually have a post with a bunch of awesome examples of changing the positioning, changing the persona, and so we'll link to that in show notes if people want more examples. Finally, let me try to summarize the stage. So I think it's important to note at this nascent stage, it's not roaring product-market fit. It's, as you described, very nascent. You're getting customers, but it's hard. You said it's 20 introductions to one sale, but you're getting them.

(00:35:25):
I know Retool has a great quote. David has this quote of, "Every customer he got early on, he felt it was the last customer he was ever going to get. No more people want this thing and it's always a struggle." So I think that's very normal, is what you're describing. The beginnings are rarely off and to the right. And it's okay if this takes a while. You said that if you spent 12 months at this stage, you're probably stuck in the stage, and signs that you're stuck in this nascent stage versus this is actually normal. Signs you mentioned are if you ask people if this went away and they wouldn't be disappointed, they'd be like, "Nah, all right. It's cool."

(00:36:01):
You have many customers, but they're using different features of the product. So to you, the way you described it, essentially, you're professional services for them. You're not actually building a product. You consult a lot of people. And then they're actually not using it often. They're buying, they're paying for it, like the last example, but they're not necessarily using it and they're going to churn pretty quickly.

Todd Jackson (00:36:19):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):
Anything else you wanted to touch on there before we get to level two?

Todd Jackson (00:36:23):
The last thing that I'd add at level one is there's this founder from a company called Persona, his name is Rick Song. He's super awesome. Persona is a First Round company. They do identity verification. And Rick's analogy, I just love it for level one, is you don't want to get friend-zoned by your customers, where your customers like you, but they don't love you and they don't need you. And he was super paranoid about this in the early days of Persona. And his technique for doing this, which I really like, is super simple, was he was very close with his first five or 10 customers.

(00:37:00):
And he would go to them and sit them down one-on-one and say, "I need your help. It is very important to me that this company succeeds and does not fail. So I don't want you to be nice to me. I want you to tell me is Persona a necessity for your company? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor came along that charged half as much as us, would you switch to them?" And he's really trying to get to the essence of: is Persona critical for you or am I in the friend zone? And I just think that's a really great way of thinking about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
I love that story. It's like in a relationship, it's the talk.

Todd Jackson (00:37:37):
It's the talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
"Are we a thing?" I love that. That's so good. The sooner you know the truth, the better. And it's hard to hear bad news, but I love that, just advice of just sit them down one-on-one. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying, "Want to take a tour?" "Check out this new feature." And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible.

(00:38:08):
But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent. So they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions.

(00:38:36):
And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. Let's talk about level two. So what does level two look like? And what should founders be focusing on when they're in level two?

Todd Jackson (00:39:19):
Yeah. So level two is developing product-market fit, and your job at level two is now you've got to go from five satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers. And so now you've got to start thinking about demand in addition to satisfaction. Because it is very hard to just grind your way all the way to 25 customers with sheer willpower, but you can do that to five, maybe 10. And we see some founders who just have phenomenal willpower and grit and grind their way to five or 10 customers. To get to 25 and to get beyond 25, the product has to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. And so that is the essence of this level.

(00:39:58):
So if you're at this level, now you're seed or Series A style company, maybe you've got up to 20 people at the company. And you're starting to work on this demand source where you have the early signs of a scalable channel, and it's not just warm intros from your VCs or from your friends. You're maybe investing in cold outreach and getting that tuned and humming. You might be investing in content, you might be doing community events, but the whole idea is you're trying to scale the demand source. It's still not easy. A benchmark, we would say, is that your sales conversion without a warm intro is still probably 10%, something like that.

(00:40:38):
First call to close one is around 10%. If you get higher than that, that's great, but that sort of benchmark for this level. You're in anywhere from the 500K to five million ARR zone, that's a hallmark of level two. And you're actually starting to think about efficiency metrics and sales metrics. You might starting to be thinking about magic number, which is a new ARR that you take in in a period divided by the CAC you spend in that period, so something in the 0.5 to 0.75 range. You want to get higher eventually, but that's pretty reasonable for this level.

(00:41:10):
You're just starting to think about retention. You've been around for a year, so you've got renewals and you want those renewals renewing. Maybe something like 10%, 20% regretted churn is okay. You don't want to be higher than that, and you want your NRR to be at least 100%. And then things like gross margin and burn multiple, they're still not the focus. Those are the classic efficiency metrics. They're not the focus right now.

(00:41:30):
But we would say you want your gross margin to be not worse than 50%, and you'd want your burn multiple to be not worse than five X. Your burn multiple, by the way, is just how much you burn in a current period versus how much new ARR comes in. So if you burn $5 million and you take in one, then you've got to burn multiple of five. And you don't want to be worse than that at this stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:51):
Amazing. There's a lot of these benchmarks which I love. I imagine not everyone's going to hit each of them exactly. These are just rough guidelines of like, "You're probably in this stage if you're in this level," right?

Todd Jackson (00:42:03):
Yeah, exactly. There's some wide bars around these metrics. It's just representative of, generally, the stage of five to 25 customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
I love it. And it's so interesting that people think of product-market fit, as you said, as this binary, "I have it or I don't." And the way you're talking about this is in this level to developing product-market fit, a company has 25 satisfied customers, they're over five million in ARR, a lot of cases they have 20 employees.

Todd Jackson (00:42:28):
Between 500K and five million. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):
500K and five million. They have 20 employees. In theory, you would think this is a roaring success. They're killing it, they have all these customers, they're growing. But it's still just level two of product-market fit. So I think this has a really interesting insight, and it reminds me of when I did a bunch of research on product-market fit.

(00:42:49):
So many founders are like, "I never felt that product-market fit. I didn't have it. It was always, 'I don't know, maybe when we get to 100 million ARR, I'll really feel like we got this.'" So I think this is a really good reminder that a lot of times you're not actually going to feel so confident this will last, and you're going to get to lasting durable product-market fit. So I think that's a really great insight here.

Todd Jackson (00:43:12):
Yeah. And the thing that's really, I think, the hallmark of level two is you've got a product that a handful of people like. It's satisfying a critical need for them. Now you've got to open the demand floodgates so that we can get to 25 customers and beyond. And different companies do this in very different ways. It's much easier said than done. Looker is an example. So Looker is a First Round company founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb. They do business intelligence. And Looker is interesting because they spent actually a long time at level one, but then flew through level two. And the reason is because Lloyd, the founder, the first five customers of Looker, he was basically going in and doing consulting for them.

(00:43:59):
And the reason is because of the nature of the product. People don't get Looker until they see their own data in it, and their data is modeled and they see the dashboards and they're like, "Oh, my God. Wow, I didn't realize these insights." So Lloyd understood Looker is not a product you could sell with Figma mock-ups. And so what happened was Lloyd would go into these customers, spend 20, 30, 40 hours before they were even a customer, modeling their data, teaching them how to use it, showing more people within the organization the power of the data and the dashboards.

(00:44:32):
And later, they called this their forward deploy process. This is how they figured out sales. And so it actually took them a long time in level one to get this right, but then they were able to do this repeatably. And so they went from five to 25 fairly quickly, and a lot of amazing... 75% close rate because they were only selling customers who were already using it. There was zero churn. And Lloyd explains once he got to 20 customers, he's like, "I know I'm onto something. And I think I figured out a model."

(00:45:03):
And the model stayed the same until they ended up selling to Google. And so they did these other things too. They started focusing on demand channels. They got a couple SDRs who were prospecting. I think they did some partner marketing with AWS Redshift. They did these look-and-tell customer events in San Francisco where they got Looker customers together to talk about what they were doing in Looker and how they built the product. But really, the groundwork was set at level one and then they moved really quickly through level two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:32):
So again, the way to think about this phase, is this is when you're starting to scale a way to drive demand. You're not just grinding sales, cold outreach. There's a way you're starting to bring in customers that are more efficient. And in Looker's case, they just started coming because I imagine there's word of mouth and people started to talk about it.

Todd Jackson (00:45:50):
Yeah. Let me do another example. A really different example is a company called Ironclad. Ironclad, it's legal. It's a legal tech company founded in 2015. Jason Jason Boehmig is the founder. AI-powered contract management software. So this was interesting because Jason, he started out calling this an AI legal assistant. And in 2024, people are like, "Oh, AI legal assistant. Yeah, that's awesome." But in 2014, people were like, "What?" And he found it really hard to sell. No one was looking for an AI legal assistant. And so he told us this story.

(00:46:29):
There was an email address on the Ironclad homepage, hello@ironclad.com. This is in 2015. And he doesn't get very much email, but Jason is checking the email. And one day he gets this one line email, and he almost archives it because he doesn't know who it's from and it's one line. But he sees that it's from a person at a publicly-traded company, and so he's like, "Oh, maybe there's something here." And the one line email is just, "Are you a CLM?" And he was like, "What is a CLM?" And he Googles for it. A CLM is a contract lifecycle management platform. And he's reading up about CLMs, and he's like, "Oh, we do that. Yeah."

(00:47:08):
And so he replies to the email, "Yes, we are a CLM." And the customer gets them on the phone. And the customer says, "Oh, I'm in the market for a CLM. I'm looking at 10 or 12 different vendors, but you guys look pretty cool because there's some automation and some AI stuff going on. Can I check this out?" And Jason's like, "Of course." So he and his co-founder take the train from San Francisco down to San Jose. And on the train, Jason is telling his co-founder, Cai, "Hey, I need you to code this up right now to make it look like what this customer is expecting."

(00:47:42):
And they get to the meeting, and they do the demo. And the customer has no idea that they just made this demo on the train, and they're a very small company. And they win the contract against these 10 or 12 other established bases, because Ironclad, it's more modern, it's automated, it's got this AI stuff. It's just a better product, or the demo looks like it's going to be a better product. And so Jason reflects on this and he's like, "Yeah, the thing for us is we had been trying to create this new category of AI legal assistant, and it was just a slog.

(00:48:10):
"And instead, when we changed our positioning to play in an existing category of CLM, but a much better CLM, but customers are already looking for a CLM, they're already looking to spend money on a CLM, and just expand the definition of what that category is, things just started to click." And that's how they got through that zone of 10, 20, 30 customers. And even if you look at the Ironclad website today, it says AI-Powered Contract Management Software. That really is the key idea still.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):
Awesome. So this is an awesome example of positioning/promise is the lever they pull here. I love the point about category design. That's one of the ongoing debates on this podcast, whether you should try to create a category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:50):
I know, it's a hot topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):
Hot topic. Sounds like you're in the boat of probably better not to create your own category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:56):
I think it's hard to create a category. It certainly works in some cases, but if you actually have a really interesting spin on an existing category, there's already buyers spending money on that thing. They're already looking for something to buy. So if you can do it, I do actually think that way is easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):
Before we get to level three, what are signs that you're maybe stuck at level two, and what should one do about that?

Todd Jackson (00:49:21):
Yeah. So the whole idea of level two is this thing that the marginal customer is getting easier. And so you've got to be focusing on demand and the repeatability of demand while you maintain satisfaction. So the yellow flags are things that are the opposite of that. Your current customers are pretty happy, but you're just having trouble opening the floodgates. As you're getting to the top end of level two, you should start to hear some startups know who you are like, "Oh, you need a SOC 2, you're a startup. Oh, Vanta." "Oh, you need AI-powered contract management software. Oh, Ironclad." You start to get known for a thing.

(00:49:59):
And so if you're having trouble opening those floodgates, and you're sitting there for, I don't know, 12 months, 18 months, that's a problem. Or you have things like your regretted churn is greater than 20%. That's a satisfaction warning sign. And again, you have to maintain the satisfaction as you work on these other things. Every level just gets more things you have to do. Or you could be finding that the sales cycle's taking too long, you're losing deals late in the funnel, you're losing the competitors. You're just not feeling the urgency from customers or you're struggling to hit the price point that you want.

(00:50:33):
And the way that customers will say this to you because customers are nice, right? They'll say, "Oh, we don't have the budget." Or, "Oh, it's just not the right time for us. We'd love to talk again next year." That means no, when you're hearing that from customers. You want customers who are like, "Oh, of course. Yeah, this is expensive, but I'm going to make this work because I need this." And so if you're seeing any of those signs, those are the signs that you maybe are stuck or plateauing at this level. And I really think it's important to think about the four Ps and think about: how am I going to pivot my way out of this? Jack Altman, who I mentioned earlier from Lattice, he's got a great quote on this.

(00:51:14):
It's up in a video on the website. What did he say? He said, "Most founders do a 10% pivot, and what they need to be doing is a 200% pivot." Jack didn't say this, but I think part of my interpretation of this is it's psychologically hard as a founder. You've gotten to this many customers, you're starting to plateau, but you're like, "I don't want to throw this whole thing away." But you have to be willing to let go and really focus on nailing the four Ps at this point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
And in your experience, do you find, essentially, pivoting is the answer if you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (00:51:52):
I think sometimes it's nice when it's the Ironclad thing, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:56):
Yeah.

Todd Jackson (00:51:57):
It's nicest when it's the Looker thing of you don't have to change anything. It just starts working and basically, the whole thing works the whole time. That's not common. It's nice when it's the Ironclad thing when you just change one of them, or maybe two of them. Starting over with all four of these is hard at level two, but oftentimes, it's what's required. I was mentioning earlier, level two is the second most common level to get stuck.

(00:52:20):
A big chunk of companies are going to get stuck at level one, and the second biggest is at level two. So sometimes it's hard. I think the trap is not doing enough to realize that you're actually not progressing to product-market fit in the way that you need to and just starting to burn money and not make progress. And you've seen many startups struggle with this. I think it's the hardest part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):
Yeah. Especially once they're a million, two million, three million ARR and they're like, "Look, we're making all this money." And they don't necessarily realize that they've been stuck at this stage for so long. So just to summarize flags that something is wrong and that you should probably think about changing your persona, your problem, your promise or your product, is it's been 12 to 18 months at this stage of product-market fit. You are churning about 20% of customers. And these are logo churn, I imagine, just like businesses stop using you.

Todd Jackson (00:53:14):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):
Your sales cycles are really slow. Is there a sense of what slow means? Just a rough heuristic. What should it...

Todd Jackson (00:53:20):
Well, some sales cycles are slow. If you're selling to companies that are big, you're selling to government, that type of thing. I don't know. Rough rule of thumb is... There's different ACVs also. If you're the kind of product that is 20K, 30K annual contracts, that was Looker, right? But they were able to do the sales cycle very repeatedly because they closed so often. There are some contracts that are 100K, 200K, six figure contracts. Those can take a long time. Those can take three to six months. You can't basically be in the worst of both worlds where you've got a slow sales cycle and a low ACV. That is the quadrant of death basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Awesome. Okay. And then the other sign is just you're not finding demand starting to come to you. You're not finding a channel to drive demand. And is a big part of this inbound? You're supposed to start seeing more inbound coming at you? Or is it more just sales becomes easier?

Todd Jackson (00:54:12):
It's both. So sales becomes easier, but I think if you are starting to get to level three, which is where we're getting to next, you've probably got 10%, 20% of your inbound coming or completely organic inbound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):
Awesome. Okay. So again, if you're stuck at this stage, and these are signs that are like, "Oh, man, this sounds familiar," your advice is find one of these things to shift the person you're going after, the problem you're solving, the way you position it and/or your product if you have to.

Todd Jackson (00:54:41):
Yeah. And probably just look for something that is a lot more of a burning pain. It's usually that the problem is not significant enough, important enough to people, or the promise is not valuable enough. It's usually one of those [inaudible 00:54:54] assuming you have a reasonable persona.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:56):
Awesome. And the reason I am spending so much time here, as you said, most companies get stuck here, like B2B SaaS companies. So I think it's really important to make sure people have something to go with. And in the course and in the post you put out, there's more examples of companies going through this and what they did. Let's talk about level three. What does level three look like? What should you be focusing on there?

Todd Jackson (00:55:16):
Yeah. So level three is strong product-market fit. This is where I think it starts to get fun. This is where all the product-market fit adages come in, "The fish are jumping into the boat. The rock is rolling down the hill and I'm trying to chase it instead of pushing it up the hill." And keep in mind, for most enterprise founders, we're now three, four or five years into the company, so it's not easy to get here. And to get to L3 here, you are looking for repeatability. The marginal customer has become much easier.

(00:55:48):
And so you mentioned, Lenny, this quote from David Hsu from Retool, which I love too, and I'll read it again. He said, "We talked to someone who said that finding product-market fit was so visceral, you immediately felt it like a geyser." And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years. At Retool, every customer we got, whether that was number four or number 14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt like rolling the stone uphill, and if you stop pushing, it's going to roll back on you and crush you.

(00:56:15):
And that's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR. That's when the boulder went down the other side and we had to chase it to keep up. And you mentioned earlier, founders were like, "I'm not sure I ever felt product-market fit." This is when you start to feel it. And Jack Altman, again, from Lattice said, "The biggest shift was in the ease of getting leads." I remember thinking, "I don't even know where these leads are coming from, just more and more of them are showing up each month."

(00:56:43):
But that is a great feeling. That is a great feeling. Filip Kaliszan from Verkada, he's in some of the videos on our website too. His quote, I'll read it, was, "After our first year of sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up with production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to happen in the span of 12 to 18 months in order to deliver on everything that customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. And that in itself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey."

(00:57:11):
So the benchmarks when you are at level three are now you're probably 30 to 100 people inside your company. You're probably at Series B-ish territory in terms of venture, maybe late Series A, maybe early Series C, but probably around Series B. You've really cracked a demand channel. You've cracked marketing and sales. You've got at least one channel that is very scalable. And probably 10% or more of your inbound is coming from just referrals and word of mouth and you're getting known, like we talked about.

(00:57:45):
ACV ranges are very high. Very wide, I should say. I'd say where you want to get to with level three is 100 customers. And so if you're approaching 100 customers and maybe you have 75K average ACV, that would be strong. You're in this wide zone of five million, all the way up to 25 million ARR. That is very level three. And you're actually starting now to think about some of these efficiency metrics. Remember, we've been punting efficiency. We were saying it shouldn't be worse than a certain number, but it's not a focus. Now, it's got to come into focus.

(00:58:20):
Because the way that we get to level four is we keep ripping on the satisfaction and the demand, and we tune this thing to get very efficient. So we're talking about our gross margin needs to be above 60%, hopefully above 70%. Our burn multiple is now below three. Ideally, we're close to one. Burn multiple in the one to three zone is where we want to be at level three. Regretted churn's less than 10%, NRR is greater than 110%. These are good benchmarks for this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
Hearing level three again tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding customers, selling, pitching, constantly trying to find new people, to level three, where it's coming at you and basically, it's the way you always hear about it, as you described. It's rolling downhill. Fish are jumping in the boat. I haven't heard that one before, but I love this.

(00:59:11):
So essentially, you found a demand channel. You found a way to get people to come to you. A lot of them are just hearing about you from other people, you don't even know where they're coming from. 10% you said are coming from referrals and you're getting to 100 customers. I actually have another quote from David Hsu at Retool, and he actually said even at 100 customers, he still felt like every customer he was getting was the last one.

Todd Jackson (00:59:33):
Oh, wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
He's like, "I can't believe we got DoorDash. That's incredible. Okay. I think there's no more. That's it."

Todd Jackson (00:59:39):
He is a critical person and critical of himself, but a very high expectations person, let's say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:43):
Yeah. Actually, another quote from Ali Ghodsi from Databricks actually said even at 100 million, he wasn't sure they had product-market fit.

Todd Jackson (00:59:50):
I mean, come on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Because he's like, "I don't know." I don't know. He felt like, "This is it. Okay, we're done. We're going to cap out here." And I get that.

Todd Jackson (00:59:58):
I think if you told many, many pre-seed founders that they'd be able to get to 100 million and not know whether they had product-market fit, they'd probably take that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):
But I think that's maybe an interesting insight. It's often good to be really paranoid and not feel like, "Okay, we're on our way. Let's start pouring in money. Let's do it."

Todd Jackson (01:00:13):
I think that's what makes a lot of the best founders the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Indeed. Okay, so level three, anything else that would be useful here? Maybe what are signs that you're struggling at level three, you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (01:00:25):
Yeah. So level three problems. And again, it's hard to get to level three, so awesome work for getting here. But the problems that might start to emerge are you've got a leaky bucket, your NRR is below 90%, or your regretted churn's greater than 10%. Maybe growth is just slowing down. You grew three X each of the prior two years, but you're struggling to do a two X this year. At level three, or five years into the company or so, there's probably a lot of competition. If you've gotten here, you've got something that's working, and people are starting to notice and there's going to be competitors.

(01:01:01):
And they could be the big competitors, they could be the new startups, but you're going to have to figure out how to navigate probably a tougher market than you entered five years ago. And so maybe you found your first scalable channel, but it's getting saturated, you got to find a new channel. These are the level three problems. Or you're growing, but like I said, with efficiency, you're spending too much money to grow. So you feel like, "Okay, yeah, we can grow at three X year over year, two X year over year, but that's going to push our burn multiple above three again." And that's a little bit of a pickle to be in when you have to trade off growth and spend like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):
You make it sound like life's great, level three people are coming at us. I think it's important to note never is it easy, never is it like, "Okay, we're good. Let's just ride this wave. Life's going to get so much easier from now on." It's never easy. As you said, there's all these things, you're always still juggling, you still aren't sure it's going to keep going.

Todd Jackson (01:01:55):
No, I agree. It's like you're spinning plates, and the higher levels you get, there's more plates. You have to keep spinning. And so at level three and getting to level four, we've got to maintain satisfaction and demand. We cannot let them regress in a market that's getting harder, and we have to really start focusing on efficiency. And the companies that can maintain satisfaction and demand and continue to grow and become really efficient, now we're at level four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Let's talk about level four. What does that look like? What are some problems people run into there?

Todd Jackson (01:02:26):
So first of all, congrats. If you get to level four, you have a valuable company. You are probably already a unicorn, and you're starting to think about, "Can I become a decacorn?" And so you've reached the highest levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. And so the benchmarks at level four are like, "Okay, now your team is probably bigger than 100 people, you're Series C, Series D or beyond. You've got more than 100 customers and you're starting to figure out, 'How do I get to 200, 300, eventually 1,000 customers?'" You're beyond 25 million in ARR, so 25 million and up, I think in ARR, it qualifies as level four. And your other metrics are looking really good too. Your sales conversion first call to close one is probably better than 15%, your magic number is greater than one, your tax payback is less than 12 months.

(01:03:13):
All these things are super awesome. And finally, now you've got your gross margin above 80%. Your burn multiple's ideally less than one at this point, you've got less than 10% churn. You've got greater than 120% NRR. And so now the whole thing is like, "Well, how do I keep growing?" This thing's gotten pretty big. And this is generally when we get to 100 million, especially and beyond, the stage that founders are thinking about, "How do I keep growing by expanding TAM, by expanding total addressable market?" And to expand TAM, I can usually take my product and bring it into new markets, or I start to think about multiple products as a way to expand TAM.

(01:03:55):
And so this is where you see all the truly great companies, the legendary companies are all able to do that. Vanta has begun to do this. They have the Vanta trust management platform, they've got security questionnaires, they've got vendor risk management. So they're starting to do this. You think of Verkada, who I mentioned before. They started with cloud security cameras, now they do alarms, now they do smoke detectors, now they do badge readers. Stripe has classic Stripe, but they've got Stripe Radar, Stripe Atlas. Square has the Square Stand, Cash App, Square Checking, Square Loans. All the companies that are tens of billions of dollars of value have figured out a way to do this. And it's like the never-ending journey that you said before, Lenny. Like, "Congrats, you got to level four."

(01:04:40):
But there's just this endless thirst for continued growth. And the interesting thing about that is that it requires finding product-market fit over and over again. Just because you got to level four on your main product doesn't mean product-market fit is free on all these new products. And you've been inside Airbnb and I've been inside Dropbox and Twitter. Getting new products to be successful is hard and it requires this mindset of like, "Yeah, we've got a little bit of advantage because people know who we are, and we have a customer set that hopefully we can layer on new products to. But it's not easy." You have to get into this mindset of product-market fit is never easy, and if we want to continue to grow, we got to find it again and again and maintain that mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
Casey Winters has this great point also that expectations of customers ever increase. And so you have product-market fit today, but there's going to be better products coming out, they're changing, the world changes. And so not only do you have to worry about competitors, there's just expectations continue to rise. So it's a never-ending battle. To give people a little bit of a broader sense here, what percentage of companies do you find make it through each of these stages in your experience, what are rough numbers you may have in your head?

Todd Jackson (01:05:52):
The majority of companies, so greater than 50%, probably closer to 60 or 70%, are going to get stuck at L1 or L2. And so that leaves, roughly, let's say, 30% make it to L3 or L4 just in our experience looking broadly. And that's our entire goal. Because again, once you get to L3, you've got a real shot, you've got a real shot at building an awesome company. And so if we get that number, help founders get that number above 30%, imagine if that was 50/50 and half the companies that we were working with at seed were able to get to level three strong product-market fit. I think that would be epic. And I think our founders would... There'd be incredible benefits to the ecosystem from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Okay. So essentially, 60% ish of companies don't make it past L2. And I love the way you're framing it of just, "If we can just get a few more companies further, that makes a massive dent both in the world and the lives of founders and people that want to use products." Another question I wanted to talk about briefly is just again, the timelines of each of these levels. Just in your rough experience, how long do each of these levels roughly take so people can get a sense of like, "Oh, it's taken a lot longer. Maybe there's a problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:07:10):
So again, this whole thing probably takes four to six years, and so let's just pick five years as the number to get to level four. I think the way this works, ideally, is you probably take 12 to 18 months to do level one, because that is the most important level, honestly, in my mind because that's where you're really choosing the right persona and the right problem to focus on. And I think just that choice is one of the most important choices that founders make. And the interesting thing, my partner, Josh Kopelman, talks about this all the time, is that founders spend 99% of their time building because that's what they've done.

(01:07:53):
And they spend 1% of their time picking, in picking the market, picking the problem, picking the customer. And in reality, it's that pick that determines the constraints and the boundaries of where you're going to be working for the next, hopefully, 10 years of your life. So there's a real imbalance there. And I actually think that that pick is the most important thing. So I would actually like to spend, let's say, somewhere 12 to 18 months in level one, just really figuring that out and figuring out my four Ps. And then, hopefully, I move very quickly. It takes me a while to get to my first five satisfied customers, but they love it.

(01:08:28):
And then I go quickly through L2, maybe that takes about a year. This is like the Looker path, the happy path. And then L3 is long just because we're going all the way from five million in revenue up to 25, and that might take a year or two, probably two years even in a good case. And then getting from 25 to 100 million is hard, obviously very hard. And then that probably takes a couple years. And then you're figuring out all of these things.

(01:08:53):
You're growing your team and your company's got a lot more moving parts and functions, and there's a demand generation side of the house and sales and there's engineering and the whole thing just gets more complicated with a lot more people. But I think that if you set the foundation really nicely at level one and level two that hopefully the whole thing... The boulder is rolling down the hill and it's carrying you forward and you don't just feel like you're pushing this rock uphill for five years. That's not a fun place to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:22):
There's a lot of founders in that place and I know a few, so this is really interesting. So you're roughly saying that maybe spend a year, year and a half on level one, which is you're just grinding, cold emailing, reaching out, selling customers, and maybe getting to five customers in the first year and a half. That's at the extreme, but that's a good outcome. And then maybe another year trying to get to... What was it? 20? 25 customers.

Todd Jackson (01:09:45):
Going from five to 25 quickly. Yeah, if I see a company go from five customers to 25 in a year, that is almost always a sign that there's some pretty strong product-market fit there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:56):
Awesome. So many companies don't go through that, and they have the funding to keep iterating, exploring, trying to figure things out. I don't know if you have the answer here, but just what's your advice of if it's been four years and demand is not starting to come to them, they don't have 25 customers? Is it, "Wait until you run out of money, just give it a shot"? Or is it, "Let's just give the money back and move on to something else"?

Todd Jackson (01:10:21):
Well, that's a personal decision for founders. I do think if you've been going at it for four to five years and you haven't started to find anything that you're really feeling pull from the market on, I don't know, you've done it for four to five years, what are the chances that you're going to magically find something? I think there are probably a handful of startups that do it that figure it out and get back on an amazing growth curve, but that's the exception rather than the rule.

(01:10:46):
So if a founder wants to return the money to investors, if a founder wants to look for a soft landing, there's no shame in that. Product-market fit is very, very hard. That's why we're doing this. It's why we're trying to increase the odds. And we're also trying to make it clear what it looks like and what it doesn't look like. And everybody knows when they do a startup that the odds are that you will not get there. So there's no shame in that, and I would completely be supportive of any founder who wants to take that path.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):
I love that advice. I think that was a really important point to make. Let's quickly summarize the levels and then I want to also summarize the four Ps again, because I think that's the thing you can actually do. And so I think I just want to reinforce, "Here's the four things you should play with if things aren't going in the direction." So first of all, let's summarize the levels, what it looks like and what you should be focusing on there.

Todd Jackson (01:11:38):
Okay. So level one, nascent product-market fit. You're just trying to get three to five customers and you're focused on satisfaction first and foremost. Level two is developing. This is where you're going from five to 25 customers, and you're really starting to focus on demand. Level three is strong product-market fit. You're going from 25 customers up to 100 or more, and you've got to start thinking about efficiency at that scale. And then level four is extreme, you're more than 100 customers, your company's awesome. You got to keep doing all three of those things well, and you have to start looking for ways to expand your total addressable market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):
Okay, perfect. And then let's come back to the four Ps. I have the draft. I have your post up here, so I have the detailed version of each of these things. But could you just talk through these four things? What is it you should be thinking about changing if things aren't working, the four Ps basically?

Todd Jackson (01:12:30):
Yeah. So the four Ps again are: persona, problem, promise, and product. And the persona is interesting because in some ways, it's synonymous with the market. A lot of people think of the market in this macroeconomic way where it's like, "Oh, it's this category of ERP software or whatever." I think it's much more tangible for a founder to think of the market as a collection of people. Jack Altman was thinking about his market as all of the HR leaders out there, and he was thinking about how many of them are there and what are the problems they have and how much money are they willing to spend on solving those problems.

(01:13:12):
It's a collection of people who have money to pay for a product or pay for a service. And so that's really the first piece, find the persona and really try to get into the mind of the persona. That's another thing I was amazed about spending time with Zach from Plaid, and Lloyd from Looker, and Jack from Lattice. They had all of these people, they were text messaging with all of their customers and they're meeting them on the weekends and stuff. They really, really knew their customer well. They were friends with their customers.

(01:13:45):
And so you've got to get so deep into the mind of the persona and: what are their challenges? What are their goals? How do you help them succeed at their job? That's the stuff that earns you the right to get the rest of the Ps right. And so the problem, obviously, comes next. And I think about this, and I can actually get into, Lenny, a little bit if you want to get into some of the customer discovery stuff because that's the second session.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
Perfect segue.

Todd Jackson (01:14:14):
And I was talking a little bit about we think of it as dollar-driven customer discovery. And I think a lot of founders are familiar with customer discovery. I think they at least talk to customers, which is good. I don't think most of them do it in the highest signal way because again, the customers, they're people, they're nice, they're going to be polite. They're also not good at predicting things that they will use or buy or want.

(01:14:41):
They're very good at talking about their problems, but they're not necessarily good at predicting their own behavior. So we think about it in terms of dollar-driven discovery, which is how do you test the dollar potential of a hypothesis? And this is a whole two-hour session, but I'll try to do it briefly here just to give you a sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):
No, let's get into it. Let's keep going. I'm just joking.

Todd Jackson (01:15:02):
So you've got to identify extreme value. This is independent of what I'm building, Lenny. I want to hear about your problems and your challenges and what is most important to you. And so I need to do it in this non-leading way and I need to avoid the trap that we call happy years. Because I found a lot of founders, "I want to build this thing, I want you to like my thing." And so I look for the things that you say that support what I'm doing. That's the trap. And so I could just try it on you, Lenny. Yeah, I might say...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):
Let's do it.

Todd Jackson (01:15:36):
Okay, Lenny, so you're doing Lenny's Newsletter and you're building Lenny's Podcasts. When you think about we're sitting here in April, over the next three months, let's say, what are your top three goals for Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:53):
Oh, wow, interesting. I'm trying to find a more scalable way to do this newsletter long-term. It's basically something I have to do for the rest of my life, in theory. I don't know if there's an exit path for this newsletter career, so I'm trying to find ways to scale this over time. That's one. Two is just up-leveling the quality of each podcast episode in terms of visuals and audio and trailers and things like that. And then three is make the community more valuable to everyone that listens that's in the newsletter community. Those are top of mind.

Todd Jackson (01:16:26):
Okay, awesome. And so what's hard about those three things? You said you want to scale the newsletter, you want to increase quality, you want to make the community awesome. What's hard about those things? Or what's standing in your way of doing those?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:39):
I don't have the answer yet, I guess is the answer. I don't know exactly how to do this yet.

Todd Jackson (01:16:44):
You don't know how to do it. Okay. It's probably a service in this case, not a product. What if I was able to give you a service that said, "Lenny, you're going to be able to scale this podcast. We are going to help you find the 500 best guests in the world that are really excellent. We're going to guarantee they show up. You're going to have endless content on your podcast, in your newsletter"? What do you think about that? What do you think about that idea?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:16):
I'd pay a lot of money for that.

Todd Jackson (01:17:18):
Okay. So that's an example of a wow statement. And you probably had in the back of your mind, "How are you going to do that? Is that actually going to work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
That's right.

Todd Jackson (01:17:28):
In my experience, that's a good thing and an exciting thing. If I'm pitching a product idea to somebody and they are like, "Wow, does that really work? And if that thing works, I'd sign up for the wait list today." That to me is like, "Okay, now I got to figure out how to build that thing, but I know if I am able to build it and deliver on that promise, they are going to want it." Or you would maybe say signs like you would demonstrate a behavior that shows that you're interested in. You'd be like, "Oh, Todd, can we meet again next week to talk about this?" Or like, "Hey Todd, I actually would love to show this to the people I work with. Can you send me the deck?"

(01:18:06):
Those are the signs that I'm looking for. If you had reacted like, "Yeah, that sounds kind of interesting," that's a no, right? That is a no. The word interesting is a polite way of saying no, right? And so I'm either looking for wow statements or I'm looking for demonstrated behavior that shows interest. I then would probably, if I want to keep going with this, and this is all in the identifying extreme value, I'd ask you, "Well, what stands out as valuable here to you?" And I want to hear you answer quickly. You mentioned it's either going to make my products so much better, it's going to drive success for my business, or it's going to save me a bunch of money or something. Save me a bunch of risk." But something where you would very quickly be able to identify why that's valuable to you.

(01:18:51):
So that part one is extreme value. Then I got to figure out ability to pay and willingness to pay. And for you, this is easy because you're not a 5,000 person company and you're the boss. So this is probably pretty streamlined. There's no procurement function at Lenny's Newsletter. So let's say I'm going after a bigger company. The questions I'd ask on confirming the ability to pay are: are you currently looking for a product like this? Or are you building something internally?

(01:19:24):
This is the Ironclad thing where Jason was like, "Oh, you're looking for a CLM already." Another way I think about it is if a customer has a problem, and I really think they have a problem, and they know they have the problem and they're looking for a solution for the problem. Or they've even tried to build their own solution to it and failed, that's the best customer. They want this thing badly. They've demonstrated that and they've actually failed at building it because they underestimated how hard it was. So are you currently looking for building a solution here?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):
Essentially, there's a budget. You're looking for, "Is there money to go towards this problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:20:01):
That's the next question I was going to say is where would a budget for this come from? And the best answer is that there's an existing budget. Either we already spend money in some way for a competing tool, or something that can be displaced by you, or we're spending, we put five engineers together to help build this thing. There's some source of budget that I can get. Then the question is, "Well, how does your team make decisions on third-party tools to bring on?" And you're never going to get the cleanest answer here. In larger companies, you might get semi-clean answers, but it's something like, "Okay, this manager can approve it directly up to a certain dollar amount. If not, it goes to this next level up of manager. And if we're going to spend more than 50K on it, we actually have to compare three different alternatives."

(01:20:47):
But whatever, there's some known process. That's what I'm looking for rather than just a bunch of ambiguity. So that's ability to pay. And then I'm going into willingness to pay. I don't want to try to quantify that. That's where I go, "What's your budget for solving this? What are you paying for this other tool? Let me show you mine. You think that you'd pay less for that or you'd pay more for that? Can you replace this other thing with the thing I have?" And then I love this question. I think you've had Madhavan Ramanujam on the show, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
Mm-hmm.

Todd Jackson (01:21:17):
He has this question, he's from Simon-Kucher. I love his thing of like, "Lenny, what is a fair price you would pay for this thing that I just described to you?" And then you say your thing. And then I go, "Okay. Well, what would be an expensive price?" And then I say, "Okay, what would be a prohibitively expensive price?" And you ask those three questions. And generally, when people tell you the fair price, it's a little bit of like they're trying to get a deal. And if the product's good, the expensive price is the one that they would actually pay.

(01:21:47):
Where they're saying it feels expensive, but you put it in front of them, and you say, "It costs this much," and if it's really good, they want it. And the prohibitively expensive one is the one that's too expensive and they'd have to just, "I just can't do that." So I love these style of questions. I think they're just a lot more specific than what I see most founders doing, which is just chatting with customers. You really want to try to put them to some questions where you know they're going to answer honestly because you're asking them questions. You're not asking them to speculate and you're asking them fairly concrete stuff.

(01:22:18):
Oh, and the thing I should say is it's a two-hour session, like I mentioned. It's one thing to explain this stuff, but it's another thing to see it. And so we show tons of Zoom recordings from founders who have gone through the program, and we actually do this thing where all the founders who are going through the program, they recorded all their videos, their customer discovery videos, and then our team watches all of the videos and creates highlight reels.

(01:22:45):
And we sit around in a room and watch them together and we say like, "Oh, look at these questions that Lenny asked. And did you see how the customer responded? Wow, that's an eyes-light-up moment." Or, "Todd asked these questions, he's leading the witness a little bit and the customer didn't seem that interested." So the thing that's interesting is as a founder, you never see anybody else's version of this. You only have your own experience. And so just seeing how other founders do this in a real live setting is super. People love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):
And it's always easy to hear these things. It's much harder to be the person asking these questions to a potential customer you're trying to sell. And it's just asking, "How much would you pay for this?" So I love that you kind of force people through the actual practice of it. Todd, you're going to get a lot of applicants for this program. This sounds amazing. I know you're giving a peek at the stuff that we haven't really talked about. On this point you just shared, which is essentially trying to get real skin in the game insight into how big of a problem this is, I love that you just basically shared a bunch of questions.

(01:23:43):
Someone could just rewind right now and just write down all these questions that you shared and use them when you're talking to customers. Obviously, the classic problem is they tell you they're going to buy it but they don't. And all the stuff you shared is, "Here's ways to get at: will they actually buy it before they have the actual product?" Is there anything else you want to say on that? Just tips for not being tricked and people just saying, "Oh, yeah, I love this thing"? I know you talked through a lot of this, but anything else?

Todd Jackson (01:24:06):
Yeah, I think there's a couple of things. One is you have to know what to show people when you're actually showing them something. Lattice is the kind of product I mentioned that could be sold with Figma mock-ups. Looker couldn't be sold that way. Looker, you actually had to do a demo with their real data. So it required a lot more work to do that. Vanta was neither like a demo or a mock-up, it was actually doing the work. And Pilot was like that. There's a bunch of companies like that. So you have to figure out what is my product and how does it solve the problem? And therefore, what fidelity does my early product or early demo have to be at in order to land the sale?

(01:24:44):
And then I think you have to know when you've talked to enough people. It takes time to talk to people. And the rule of thumb is if you talk to enough people and you can predict 70 to 80% of what the next person is going to say to you, because you've just talked to so many people and you've heard the pattern so clearly, that's when you've talked to enough people. But these are all things you got to learn. And that's why doing it experientially in the way that we do the program we think was best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Is there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to touch on before we let you go?

Todd Jackson (01:25:15):
No. If you're listening, if you're a B2B founder in those early days of starting your company, or you know anyone who fits that description, and you have an appreciation for just how hard it is to find product-market fit and you don't want to go it alone, then please apply to this program or share the application. Like we promise, we will review every single application. And I'm just really looking forward to working with a group of 20 or so amazing founders, and helping them navigate these early days of product-market fit finding. It's what I love to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:43):
So just to make sure the right people apply, remind people who is a great fit. So it's B2B founders, and you said they've been at it for six to nine months, something like that?

Todd Jackson (01:25:52):
Yeah, something in that zone or earlier. You have an idea of what your product is. You have a hypothesis about what it is and who it's for, but you probably haven't started writing any code yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:01):
And if they've been at it for four years and haven't found success, this is not a fit.

Todd Jackson (01:26:07):
I could try to help them one-on-one, but no, that's not a fit for this program.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:10):
And then how do they apply and when are their applications due?

Todd Jackson (01:26:13):
Yeah. So you go to pmf.firstround.com. Applications are open. They're going to go till May 7th, and then the program starts on May 29th. And if you want to reach out to me specifically, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @tjack, T-J-A-C-K. You can follow me, DM me. And yeah, I'm looking forward to working with some amazing founders that I know are listening right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:34):
Amazing. I'm so happy we did this. I feel like this conversation is going to help a ton of founders, and they're going to come back to it again and again. Todd, thank you so much for being here.

Todd Jackson (01:26:43):
Lenny, it's been a pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:44):

# Billion dollar failures, and billion dollar success | Tom Conrad (Quibi, Pandora, Pets.com, Zero)

## Transcript

Tom Conrad (00:00:00):
There's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. I think, in some ways, our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. There's an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere. That would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has a mathematical formula that's going to win on any metric. Whatever metric you care about. You want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Speaker 1 (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Tom Conrad. Tom was an engineer at Apple, CTO of Pandora, which he helped take from zero to 80 million users. He's also VP of product at Snap, where he was the right-hand man to Evan Spiegel for two years. He's been on the Board of Sonos for over seven years. He was also part of two infamous product failures, Quibi, where he was chief product officer, which raised over $2 billion and died less than a year after launch.

(00:01:17):
He was also a senior engineering leader at Pets.com, which famously went from nothing to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months. Today, Tom is the CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is on a mission to extend the lifespan and the health span of the human race. In our conversation, we dig into what Tom's learned from these famous product failures, also, what he's learned from the many product successes. Tom also shares what he's learned about how to pick where to go work and what to avoid. How important understanding the math formula of the business model is. Also, lessons on burnout and health and leadership and contrarian corner. With that, I bring you Tom Conrad, after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:01):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates.

(00:02:25):
Within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKI process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down.

(00:02:52):
Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars startup credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

Speaker 1 (00:03:17):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.

(00:03:44):
With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds. It's all built on Jira where your engineering team's already working. True collaboration is finally possible. Great products are built by great teams, not just engineers. Sales support, leadership, even Greg from Finance.

(00:04:12):
Anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free. No catch. It's only $10 a month for you. Say goodbye to your spreadsheets and the never ending alignment efforts. The old way of doing product management is over. Rediscover what's possible with Jira product discovery.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Tom, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tom Conrad (00:04:44):
Thank you. It's so fun that I get to be a part of this.

Lenny (00:04:46):
I thought it'd be fun to start with a story about your time at Apple and you building this now very ubiquitous feature of dragging and dropping something into a folder. Which I saw you tweet about or talk about at a talk and the fact that it's still around. Can you just share that story and maybe a lesson from that experience that you've taken away?

Tom Conrad (00:05:05):
Sure. Let's see. I was 15 years old when the Macintosh came out. I remember really clearly my entire teenage years. All I wanted to do was to move from Columbus, Ohio to Cupertino and work for Apple. My heroes were that team of people that had written their signatures on the inside of the Macintosh. We cracked open the first Macintosh case. You would find the signatures of the 20 people or so who worked on the Mac. That was my only ambition, truly.

(00:05:40):
This was a period where no one wanted to work for Apple. That wasn't a thing. It seems like maybe a little obvious today, but it wasn't an obvious ambition at all back then. Anyway, I went to college. It's all I wanted to do. Studied computer engineering at University of Michigan, and as we talk about my career, it is just over and over and over. I'm going to say an incredibly lucky thing happened. The first incredibly lucky thing that happened for me in my career probably was that University of Michigan happened to be a place that Apple recruited from.

(00:06:08):
I didn't know that when I chose the school, but it made it reasonably easy to connect to a hiring manager at Apple. I wrote an actual letter and put it in an actual envelope and put it in the mail and got an internship and drove out in my dad's Pontiac from the Midwest to California. Spent a summer interning and my last day of the internship, I was thinking about really what I wanted to do when I came back. Hopefully came back to Apple after I graduated.

(00:06:39):
I had worked on a product that became shipped. It was called the QuickDraw GX. It was earlier second generation rendering system for the Mac. I'd been that team's intern for the summer. But what I really wanted to do is I wanted to work on the Finder. This is the only thing in the whole world I really wanted to do. I went and found Ron Lichty, who is the manager of the Finder team and said, "I graduate in 10 months. I'd love to be a part of your team."

(00:07:06):
I think he was like, why are you coming and talking to me now? You're literally going back to Michigan tomorrow. I go back to Michigan in May, the phone rings and Ron says, "The college recruiting department just told me that I have a college hiring rep and if I don't use it by tomorrow, I lose it." He's like, "I can't even interview you, you can't meet the team, but you're basically a freebie for me. Do you want this job?"

(00:07:38):
Just insanely lucky moment, got this job. I get to Apple in the summer of 1992 and I have a laundry list of things that I would like to do to make the Finder more usable. I remember sitting in Ron's office and saying, "At the grocery store, when you're carrying bags of groceries out, the door's automatically open for you? I think the Finder should do the same thing. When you're dragging an icon around and you want to put it in a folder, you should be able to hover maybe over the folder icons and drill down into the file system to get to where you're going.

(00:08:20):
Then when you drop the file, all of the folders that opened up between you and your source and your destination would close for you." Ron thought that was a fine idea, so that was the way Apple worked in those days. I just went off and started coding that up. I got to the point late one night, two in the morning at Apple, no one else was there, where I needed some kind of animation to indicate that the folder was about to open.

(00:08:48):
I'm certainly not an animator and I certainly wasn't going to do anything thoughtful in the middle of the night. I just wrote some code that blinked the folder, like selected unselected, selected unselected five times and thought, oh, I'll email one of the really talented visual designers to do something much more interesting. Long story short, apple finally shipped that feature four years later. Sat in the source code repository forever while we did other things.

(00:09:21):
When it shipped four years later, it blinked five times. Roll the clock forward six or seven years, Mac plus 10 comes out, entirely new Finder rewritten from scratch. No spring-loaded folders anywhere to be seen. People complained about it. It got re-implemented. All of the code, brand new. Folder blinks five times when you hover over it. Roll the clock forward another decade, IOS comes along and they added folders. When you drag an icon around, it blinks a few times.

(00:09:51):
I'm not sure what the point of this story is other than maybe it's something about, I think we all do this as designers and product people. We take these shortcuts that we think that we'll go back later and clean up. Sometimes, it's literally been 30 years that little design detail lingers three implementations later and now it's just a part of the way that these Apple products work. Pretty bizarre.

Lenny (00:10:16):
As you were talking, I'm on a Mac right now recording this and I just did it just to make sure it's still there and it is indeed still there. I think it blinks three times and then just opens up for you.

Tom Conrad (00:10:25):
There you go.

Lenny (00:10:26):
Full engineers got royalties on features they build that continue to live on in our product.

Tom Conrad (00:10:30):
Okay, I'll tell you just one other little thing to center you in time about what the Finder was like in 1992. We didn't get royalties, but our names were in the About box. You would go to About the Finder and the seven of us, there were seven engineers at Apple that worked on The Finder. Our names would scroll by the Finder, copyright 1992, yada, yada, yada, one name after another. Totally different era.

Lenny (00:10:55):
It feels like you got what you wanted with the name scribbled on the motherboard.

Tom Conrad (00:10:59):
For sure. I've gotten a lot of the things I wanted as a kid.

Lenny (00:11:05):
Along the same lines, I want to talk a bit about picking where to go work. Clearly you had a sense you wanted to go work at Apple. Over your career, you've landed at a lot of really successful places. You've also landed at a lot of very famous failures that we're going to talk about. What advice would you give people for helping them pick where to go work based on your experience?

Tom Conrad (00:11:25):
When I was a kid, my ambition to work at Apple was entirely about the product, so probably that version of me would say, find a product that you're passionate about and go spend your time and energy on that thing. Pretty quickly you learn that an awful lot of your development and day-to-day satisfaction really comes from the people that you get to collaborate with. Can you learn from them? Do you like them? Do they challenge you in the right ways?

(00:11:53):
Do they give you latitude in the right ways? It's so much about not just what, but who. For a very long time, my advice would've been entirely in the category of life, find something that you love with people that you think are amazing and the rest will take care of itself. Interestingly, I have been lucky enough to have some things that were successful on the metrics, get talked about the most, big audiences, big financial return, et cetera, et cetera. I've also worked on some things that were really notable disasters. When I look back on my career and think about the things that I've done, my professional satisfaction is not well correlated with those external metrics and very, very coordinated with do I love the thing we were building and do I love the people I was working with?

Lenny (00:12:43):
Following the thread of the people. I think one of the hardest things is really knowing what the people are like until you join. I think as a chief product officer joining or VP of product, you have a lot of time that you spend with the team. Most people don't. They have an interview and then they're like, all right, I got to make a decision. Do you have any advice for how to help people get a sense if the people are the kind of people they want to work with?

Tom Conrad (00:13:03):
I think people are really, really good at this. Every single time I've taken a job where it turned out that I was working with people who had a different set of values or working styles than I had, I knew. You tell yourself that, at least in my case, I tell myself a story about why the thing I suspect might be the case isn't the case. But you do this in your personal life all the time. You meet people out at dinner, so you get seated next to them at some industry event or something, and sometimes you come home and say to your partner, oh my gosh, the person next to me was just the worst. Then sometimes you're like, I think I made a permanent lifelong connection with this total stranger who just happened to sit next to me.

Lenny (00:13:55):
It's a very simple piece of advice that I think people don't fully appreciate is just trust your instinct, trust your gut. Just pay attention to what comes up when you're around people at a certain company. Okay, you brought up this phrase of notable disasters, and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. I just want to spend some time in these two areas. Maybe the way to set it up is, what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work and maybe advice you share with people?

Tom Conrad (00:14:37):
Probably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually, I think in both instances they became dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. Frankly, even in the case of pets.com, even the high profile nature of it.

(00:15:09):
I could have worked at one of a thousand E-commerce websites in 1999. When I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, they were like, I never heard of the thing that you worked on. But everybody certainly heard about pets.com. It's a pretty funny example too, of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. While as a leadership team, we made I'm sure all kinds of mistakes.

(00:15:39):
One of the things that happened was that there were three overfunded pet E-commerce sites. We all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then. We all thought it was a zero-sum game. That as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising, we all did. It became this unwinnable arms race. There is, I think, a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross. Or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise. Then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for three billion dollars. Biggest E-commerce acquisition of all time. Well, I think it's probably unfair to compare Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick and turned it into something really remarkable.

(00:17:07):
To pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way. The critique that is often leveled at pets.com, or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work. That's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It was really, really early.

Lenny (00:17:33):
I saw a stat, I think you shared somewhere, that you took pets.com from nothing to a public company to completely out of business in 19 months.

Tom Conrad (00:17:40):
Yeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. The leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. It was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. It was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was a fruitless attempt to salvage it.

Lenny (00:18:29):
Did not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?

Tom Conrad (00:18:40):
The miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it re-lit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, for 25 years or something. I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot. I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. It also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different.

(00:19:23):
I had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They're ridiculous. It's like maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, "Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?"

(00:19:42):
I'd be like, "No, I don't know anything about baking." "Oh, you like landscape photography. Do you take photos?" "No, I don't take photos." But I was committed to the bit, actually to the point where when Techwrench interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely. That story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was for New TV at the time.

(00:20:15):
The pitch was, we're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and consumer tech and weld it to the best of Hollywood style content production. To build something completely bespoke and purpose made for consumption on the phone. They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody, it just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them?

(00:20:50):
I listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. We kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow. Then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time, and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product.

(00:21:26):
Both of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself. Both of them had left after about six weeks. Meg's like, "We've raised all this money and we told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help. I would consider it a personal favor if you were to come and spend just a couple of days a week helping." She's like, "I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground." My wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist, and loves her life as a freelance contributor. She's like, "You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week. It's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it?" I'm like, "No. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself."

(00:22:27):
She's like, "No." She's like, "Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do." Well, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away. It was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch.

(00:22:58):
To take advantage of all of the modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. I'm embarrassed about some of what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience. I just really fell in love with the industry again, and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.

Lenny (00:23:35):
Is there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid? What to try to pull towards?

Tom Conrad (00:23:43):
I think I misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. That was always my ambition.

(00:24:16):
Find a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it really delightful way. Go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across. The really great word of mouth. But I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also like a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon.

(00:24:54):
Yes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation. I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money. But we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. It was a pretty major accomplishment. We made a bet that we would augment those sort of-

Tom Conrad (00:26:00):
And we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth, that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.

(00:26:26):
One super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired, so there was no back catalog of it. And it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out. It was really expensive, like I said, it was like a third of the investment we were going to making content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content.

(00:26:51):
And we launched two weeks into Covid and we couldn't make any of that content, except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube, that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood. Now, you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that.

(00:27:26):
But I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, it is enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger, and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself, because our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format.

(00:28:06):
And so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take 6 or 8 or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone could stomach.

Lenny (00:28:27):
Wow. I really like this metaphor and this mental model of the math formula of the entire business and thinking of it that way. I knew Covid changed the way people consumed content and that hurt. Quibi I think it was meant to be on the go, not sitting at home where you could watch anything you want. But also the fact that the content couldn't be made as well, as you were hoping to make.

Tom Conrad (00:28:46):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (00:28:49):
As a CPO, one of the biggest challenges is pushing back, trying to convince the founders of their mistakes, of doing what they want and just powering through it and dealing with it sometimes I guess is there anything you think you could have done looking back, or was the math formula set up for failure from the beginning and it's probably just not going to work out almost no matter what you did?

Tom Conrad (00:29:10):
One of the bets was that we weren't going to just use the apparatus of Hollywood to make the content. In part, we are going to use the apparatus of Hollywood to market the content. So Jeffrey had recruited this incredible Rolodex of literally the world's most famous celebrities to make shows for Quibi. We kind of had everyone either made something for launch or was going to make something.

(00:29:42):
And part of what they're going to do is turn up in culture and talk about their shows. We've heard a lot in the last six months about how hard it's to market movies because the stars can't go out and talk about the movies during the strike.

(00:29:54):
There was this theory that you could apply the marketing technique of Hollywood to get 20, 30 million people into the theater on opening weekend for Quibi. And that was always a very, very audacious take, I thought. Uber has all the money in the world to experiment with paid user acquisition, and they're not consistently a top 10 most downloaded app in the app store.

(00:30:26):
But the theory of Quibi, the math of Quibi, did require us to from day one land in the top 10 and stay there forever. The model would have worked if we could do that. And to the Hollywood marketing apparatus, the numbers that it takes to get there felt kind of small. If you can get 20 million people in to see Shrek on opening night new IP, surely you can get them to take their phone out of their pocket and download this thing and start a free trial.

(00:30:54):
Now, those of us who have spent our life in Silicon Valley making software and really, really tried to get people to show up and download new IP in large numbers know just how hard that is.

(00:31:09):
So maybe if I critique my own contribution to the math equation, maybe I should have beat the drum a little harder about just how unlikely it was that we were going to land the kind of distribution in month one that the model sort of required. If I had to go back and do it again, I think I would spend maybe more time investing and illuminating that aspect of the digital universe.

Lenny (00:31:42):
That is such a good takeaway of just showing the leaders, here's the data, here's the assumptions that we're all betting on, and do you believe this can happen? And they probably would've said, "Yes, this will happen. I'm so confident."

Tom Conrad (00:31:55):
What made it hard was, it wasn't structurally impossible. If you had to be bigger than any app that had ever been made, then you could probably make the case it's impossible. But since you only sort of had the land in the top 10, you couldn't quite say it was impossible, you could just say it was highly improbable.

(00:32:18):
And maybe one of my mistakes was, I guess I imagined that we would launch, and when the likely thing happened that we got millions of people to download the app, which we did, and then when we inevitably struggled to retain those users at high percentages, and we retained at what I think of as a good industry starting point, but we weren't setting any records on retention. I just imagined that what would happen next is the thing that happens in all young companies, you would iterate. You would grind on the funnel until a year later, two years later, six months later, whatever it is. You figured the formula out to get people in and get them to stay and get them to retain.

(00:33:12):
And what I didn't appreciate was just how quickly you go back to the foundational math and then the math really says you just can't. You can't spend two years iterating your way on optimizing the funnels like you would in a startup that had a different cost structure. In a world where you have to spend a billion dollars a year of making content, you just can't afford to not be a hit.

Lenny (00:33:40):
I think it's also important to just remind us, it's okay for these things to happen. People take a bet, as you said, we're going to try this thing, here's our bet, here's our experiment. We're betting on this sort of format in this business. We're going to raise money from investors that know they might lose all their money. And it sometimes doesn't work out. It's part of the game.

Tom Conrad (00:33:56):
It's certainly painful to take money from investors even if they know what they're doing and to not get them a return. I feel a real responsibility to investors to do better than we did at Quibi.

(00:34:08):
But yeah, I mean, there is a risk reward thing that goes along with these investments, and part of the reason they get all the riches on the upside is that they're going to bet on some Quibis along the way too.

Lenny (00:34:18):
So as you were talking, you said that it was called NewTV, and that sparked a memory, and I searched my email. And I actually got an email from a recruiter in 2018, we just kicked off a very special executive opportunity, the CPO at NewTV, a new venture in Los Angeles, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, raising a billion dollars, working with top talent. Are you interested in exploring this opportunity?

Tom Conrad (00:34:41):
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny. Your story could have been so much different.

Lenny (00:34:46):
This could have been Thomas podcast. Lenny, tell me about what happened at Quibi.

Tom Conrad (00:34:51):
I would take that free.

Lenny (00:34:54):
I don't know. There's pros and cons. They even sent this whole PDF, a TV in your pocket, NewTV. Amazing. All right. I'm going to read through this and see what they pitched back in the day.

(00:35:05):
Okay, let's move on to things that worked out really well, let's call it notable successes, other products you worked on that worked out great. So I'll list a few of them. And maybe what might be helpful is just we'll just go through each one and share what you took away from that experience, a lesson you learned from working on those products.

(00:35:23):
The ones that come to mind for me are Snap, Pandora, Apple if we want to go there. Also, you built, I don't know exactly what you did there, but you worked on You Don't Know Jack, this game that I loved. I think if you're an elder millennial, you're just going to like, "Oh my God, I love that game." I don't even remember it exactly, but I just remember the visceral feeling of playing that game and it was so much fun. So that's cool. I didn't know that you worked on that. And then there's also Sonos, which you're on the board.

(00:35:49):
So whatever order you think might be most interesting, just going through those and what did you learn from that experience?

Tom Conrad (00:35:56):
I worked at Apple in the interval where Steve was gone, John Skelly, that kind of period, so System 7, System 8, Power Macintosh, that whole era. And we were doing a lot. We shipped a bunch of great hardware. We transitioned the company from Motorola 68,000 CPUs to the Power PC architecture.

(00:36:19):
But, particularly in that transition, we really struggled to ship consumer software features. I mentioned that I wrote three LAN folders and some other consumer features in my first six months at Apple, and they shipped four years later, actually after I'd left the company. I was a little surprised they were still in the software repository even, candidly.

(00:36:40):
But I'll tell you that one of the things culturally about Apple in that moment was, at least I felt like, a person was really rewarded if they could make a kind of broad contribution across functions. So if you were a talented software engineer, but also a thoughtful product designer, and maybe also had interesting input on product marketing, that you could build a really great reputation inside the company by playing all of those positions a little bit day to day.

(00:37:19):
And so when I left Apple after four years, I look back on my time, I didn't ship as much software as I had hoped, and I felt like a little bit like a professional gadfly. I was six miles wide and a centimeter deep.

(00:37:36):
And I went to work for this company called Berkeley Systems. In addition to You Don't Know Jack, they made a flying toaster screensaver, if you remember. You remember the nineties?

Lenny (00:37:48):
How could you forget that?

Tom Conrad (00:37:50):
And when I met them, they were picking off this game development for this trivia game, and were looking for someone to lead the technical team. And so I joined as technical director for the You Don't Know Jack franchise, managed a team of engineers, and it was a completely different culture than what I was used to at Apple.

(00:38:11):
It was certainly the case that I was welcome to weigh in on the game design or the marketing or some other aspect of the deliverables, but my job was to build the software on time with high quality, period. And if I did those things, I'd be rewarded. And if I didn't, I would not be successful. And no amount of insightful feedback on the gameplay or the packaging, or whatever else I might want to do, was going to benefit me and my career at all.

(00:38:48):
And it was such a blessing to be forced to go deep on something, because I spent a lot of time developing chops as an engineering manager, but I also wrote a ton of software. And that's really honestly when I became a software engineer. My college education was insufficient to get me there, and the amount of software I wrote at Apple was insufficient to get me there. But I came out of my Berkeley Systems You Don't Know Jack experience feeling like I could really hold my own technically in a way that just wouldn't have happened.

(00:39:20):
And so I do think that there's something to be said for a culture where there are swim lanes and people are encouraged to be really, really exceptional in their lane. And so I feel really lucky that I stumbled into You Don't Know Jack When I did.

(00:39:36):
And it was also, I mean, it was the first thing that I worked on that had just huge cultural awareness for a couple of years. I mean, it's crazy, they're still making sequels. It has been nearly 30 years, and there are versions of You Don't Know Jack that are in all of the stores, in the PlayStation store, in the Xbox store, in the iOS store. You can play new versions of You Don't Know Jack to this day. It's crazy.

Lenny (00:40:07):
Did not know that. I see the website now and it's a little different, but basically the same.

Tom Conrad (00:40:13):
So I'd say my lesson from You Don't Know Jack was definitely, it really does pay to get good at something and not just be a generalist.

(00:40:24):
And then, I mean Pandora, it wasn't quite the next thing that happened. After You Don't Know Jack was Pets.com, and then after Pets.com there was nuclear winter in the industry and I worked in enterprise software for a while.

(00:40:37):
And after nuclear winter I had this idea that I was going to build a destination for music discovery on the web. And I've been doing enterprise software, the consumer intranet was non-existent for those years, early aughts.

(00:40:54):
But around 2004, things started to thaw a little bit and you started to hear the first signs of the companies that we came to call Web 2.0, Flickr would've been one of the early examples. And one of the enterprise software things I did was a personalization recommendation engine that used a vector space. It's like a lot of the things that we're talking about now in AI, albeit 20 years ago.

(00:41:21):
And so I knew something about recommendation systems in the enterprise space, and I was super passionate about music. I'm not a musician, but I was that kid in college who would corner you and be like, oh, if you like this band, I got to play this for you and [inaudible 00:41:37] with stereo until you would beg to leave.

(00:41:40):
And so I had this idea that maybe I can use the internet to do that at scale, not with just one person, but with hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people maybe. Introduce them to music that they would love but otherwise would miss out on.

(00:41:53):
And I promised that I was going to tell stories about luck in my career, there's been a gazillion of them. But one really dramatic incidence of that is I was sort of biding my time to exit this enterprise software company. I was VP of engineering, a whole team that reported to me. I felt a lot of responsibility to exit in a responsible way. But I was really excited about this digital music company that I was going to start. But I wasn't telling anyone at all because I didn't want ti to get back to the team.

(00:42:25):
So I flew down to Los Angeles to go out to Coachella in the spring of 2004, and completely randomly physically bumped into a guy that I had gone to high school with on the polo field, and hadn't seen him in a decade. And the thing that we had in common in high school was we loved music. And so I tell them the story of, I'm going to start this company to do personalized digital music on the internet. And he said, there's this woman I work with who just left our company to move to Oakland to work for this little company called Savage Beast that are also doing something in music recommendation. Do you want to talk to them? And I said, "Sure, why not?"

(00:43:11):
So I got introduced to Tim Westergren, who was the founder of Savage Beast. Savage Beast was like a seven or eight full-time employees at that point. They made a music recommendation engine that they licensed to other companies to put in consumer products. So Savage Beast's customers were Best Buy, who put it in kiosks, and AOL, who used it on the AOL Music website. And they were looking for a VP of engineering. And I got the offer, thought about it a little bit. I declined because it was kind of this B2B2C thing and I really wanted to do something consumer and I had an idea about the app.

(00:43:49):
And a month later, they called again and said, "We keep talking to people. We really think that you're the person." And interestingly, one of the reasons they thought that I was the person is they were really impressed by the fact that I had run engineering at Pets.com. So I mean, it's just one of those things where these things do pay dividends, even when they're a disaster.

(00:44:07):
And honestly, what I would really say was almost like a lapse in judgment, I said yes, even though it wasn't the product that I wanted to build. And I won't bore you with all of the details, but 90 days later, after some typical early stage founder drama stuff, the founding head of technology and product had resigned completely unrelated to my arrival. And the company had a new CEO, Joe Kennedy, and Joe had this idea for what he called the 1-Click Personal Radio. And Joe is a product marketer and just the best CEO in the whole world. We spent 10 years together building Pandora.

(00:44:51):
And he sort of gave me the keys and just said, "As long as it fits the brief for 1-Click Personal Radio, it's all yours." And I got to build the team and the culture, in collaboration with him and Tim the founder, over the course of the next 10 years, and just every good thing.

(00:45:14):
So I mean, there's just a million billion lessons from Pandora, and everything I am as a product leader and then an engineering leader comes from things that happen at Pandora.

(00:45:24):
But maybe the thing that I think of first is, I think we met our early audience in an incredibly genuine way. For example, when we launched the support@pandora.com was an alias for all@pandora.com. So if you sent a customer service request to Pandora, every single person in the company received it. And because we made a decision to have no customer support team in the first year, the expectation was that whoever sees the request first should respond to it.

(00:46:01):
And so you would write to us and you would get the founder or you'd get me or you'd get the engineer who wrote the feature or you'd get the CEO. And there were no macros to respond to commonly asked question. There was no read the FAQ. And there were no rules about what you could and couldn't say. If the person's like, "I think this feature is stupid and broken," we would encourage people to say, "You know what? I think you're right and I'm really struggling to get our stupid head of product to agree with me. I'm going to CC Tom and maybe we can convince him that this was a bad decision."

(00:46:35):
And we did all of that because we thought one of our superpowers as a young company was that we could just engage with our audience as real human beings, not as a shiny brand that was trying to be something that we could just never be. This period is where the iPod and iTunes are at the peak of their powers. And so there was no way we could sort of out-Apple Apple on the brand front.

(00:47:02):
And so we were just ourselves, and I think it really, really was a catalyst for the word of mouth that developed around Pandora. And we never spent any money on paid user acquisition, literally no dollars in the entire time I was there, because people loved the product and they told their friends about it and that's how it grew.

Lenny (00:47:21):
I saw a stat that you grew Pandora from 0 to 80 million users, from 10 employees to 3000 employees, from 0 basically to a multi-billion dollar company.

Tom Conrad (00:47:31):
We did those things. We did.

(00:47:34):
Also, I think my product stewardship in some ways set the scene for Spotify to walk through the digital streaming door and show us the exit. So Pandora is, again, such a privilege to be able to work on something that touched and continues to touch tens of millions of people's lives every month. But it's bittersweet from the standpoint that I think we had an opportunity that in some ways we misplayed.

Lenny (00:48:06):
My mom is still a huge fan of Pandora, uses it every day for whatever choice.

Tom Conrad (00:48:10):
I mean, it's still going. And the numbers are still tens of millions of people in the US listen every month. So it's a thing. But yeah, it's a little sad that it didn't have quite the staying power that some of these other things that have come along since have.

Lenny (00:48:25):
Just on that topic, do you think there's something that you could have done, someone could have done? Do you think there was an opportunity to become Spotify? Or is it the business model and the math formula was set up in such a way that it was near impossible?

Tom Conrad (00:48:37):
One of the things that was tough for Pandora was that when we started it, digital music was a category that no investor wanted to touch. It was lawsuits. There was no money to be made. There were relationships with the labels that were completely impossible to nurture. And there had been no big outcomes. I think the biggest exit in digital music when we got going was I think Yahoo had bought Musicmatch for like $400 million. And so that was seen as kind of the ceiling on the opportunity.

(00:49:08):
And along the way we found investors who believed in our vision and invested ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars in the company over its pre-public years. But there was never investor enthusiasm for the company in the category that was anything like the investor enthusiasm that a company like Spotify enjoyed just six, seven years later, Snap enjoyed for its pre-public tenure.

(00:49:35):
And I think part of what was different for Spotify is that the comps were not... Musicmatch was 400 million, they were Pandora at 8 billion, but even above that they were Netflix at 100 billion. And so investors just had this new sort of optimism about what you could do in subscription and in streaming, and Spotify really played that to their advantage in a way that we couldn't because we had gone public and the public market investors were still trying to figure us out. So we didn't have access to capital. It was very hard for us to take the same kind of risks that Spotify took.

(00:50:17):
But then I think we just completely misjudged one really important thing, which is that we were really inspired by disrupting terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is the predominant form of music consumption in the country. People spend, I can't remember the exact stats, but by minutes consumed, it's something like 10 times more music minutes a month on radio in the aughts and early tens than on owned music. And the advertising supported sort of radio market was a $30 billion category, and recorded music was $8 billion.

(00:50:57):
And so we had this idea that we're going to reinvent radio, and Spotify and Rdio and Apple Music and the 14 others, Rhapsody, which was Spotify before Spotify, they were all going to chase this smaller owned recorded music opportunity, and that we could be left relatively alone over here going after the less sexy but actually bigger market. And I think we just got it wrong. It should have been obvious that inevitably all of your music in any format was going to be delivered as a stream from the cloud. And that the record labels in particular, they were going to set the terms on what the structure was. And the structure that they preferred was the Spotify structure. And we operated under a different licensing...

Tom Conrad (00:52:01):
And we operated under a different licensing regime that they hated, that was a statutory license that we got from the government. And it would've been exceptionally risky for us to come out from under the statutory license and do direct deals with the labels, but it was a requirement to play in the world that they imagined as the future, and we should have imagined as the future, too. And eventually, the company got around to it, but it was too late.

Lenny (00:52:29):
It's interesting that so much of this was rooted in that original vision that you shared of Pandora of the radio, smart radio in your pocket, [inaudible 00:52:37] personal radio that you just stayed on that track, even though there was this other track. But I think it's important to point out, you said it was seven years later. And I feel like there's this interesting trend with the companies you've worked at, pets.com and Pandora, that it's too early, you just come too early at these ideas. And I feel like that tells me Quibi might still happen. There's a Quibi coming seven years from now.

Tom Conrad (00:52:59):
You know what's really funny about that? Just today, there's a headline about a Hollywood-produced show that's launching on Instagram Reels and TikTok that was shot vertical. And the headline is literally something like, "Is TikTok the new TV?" And it's pretty funny that literally, that's what Jeffrey and Meg called it when they were incubating the idea. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that purpose-built video for mobile looks a lot like TikTok. And I don't want to take anything away from all of the innovation in that space that they and the other players are driving that Quibi didn't capture in its initial product definition. But I mean, obviously, we stare at our phones consuming video of all kinds all day every day. So there there's definitely something there.

Lenny (00:53:53):
The PDF that I mentioned that I got from the recruiter, the first page again says, "You have a TV in your pocket." So it's exactly what they're pitching. That's amazing. All right. I think what I've learned, I need to bet all my money on this new Quibi clone because the timing might be right.

Let's talk about Snap briefly, and then I want to have a couple more questions.

Tom Conrad (00:55:21):
At Pandora, I was the head of product and was head of engineering. And our CEO was brilliant, but he was a product marketer. I mean, Joe was all things. He was an engineer by education, and a great marketer, and a great finance person, and just such a utility player at a very, very high level across every discipline. But he was also really, really good at letting his team do their jobs. He really let me run product and engineering. And so not only did I have tremendous latitude to make good and bad decisions about product, I also really got a seat at the table to help lead the company. So rewarding, so gratifying. Best professional experience that one could have.

(00:56:05):
So I leave Pandora after a decade. I take a year trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. But after about a year, I got introduced to Evan. And it's kind of a funny story. A mutual friend sent this introduction over. Evan immediately responded and said, "Why don't you come down to Los Angeles and have a coffee with me?" So I fly down. It's not clear if it's a job interview or what it is really. I mean, I was just lightly exploring things that were out there and was a big fan of what he was doing with Snapchat. So I spent 45 minutes with him, and then I spent 45 minutes with the head of engineering, and another 45 minutes with the head of legal, and then they tossed me into a conference room with a dozen product designers, all in their mid to late 20s, many of which had gone to school at Stanford with Evan.

(00:57:01):
I would come to learn all really, really, really impressive super, super talented people, but it was just 10 of us sitting around a conference table. And it wasn't really clear that they knew why they were talking to me, but we had an hour long free ranging conversation. And so I left, and I thought it was a totally fascinating morning, but I wasn't sure what had happened, really. It was like "Well, with these interviews, it all seemed very ad hoc. Is there a job opening?" It was a little odd. And I went to lunch on Abbott Kinney and got a text from Evan's admin saying, "Can you come back to the office? Have you gotten on your plane yet?" I was like, "I was just ordering lunch. I'll just come back right away."

(00:57:49):
So I go back. Now, it's one o'clock in the afternoon. This entire thing started at nine o'clock in the morning. I sit down in the conference room. Evan comes in with a manila envelope and says, " We loved you. We'd like for you to be our VP of product," and handed me a written offer, all the terms, the stock compensation, the whole thing. I'm gobsmacked. I'm flattered, that this is really playing to my ego. I can't believe that this company that feels like maybe the most interesting thing that's happening in consumer tech, that their notoriously brilliant and mercurial founder has taken enough of a shine to me that he wants to give at least some of the keys to the product kingdom over after such a short courtship.

(00:58:34):
So I leave, and when some of that buzz wears off, I start to wonder if there's some red flags here maybe. So I tell Evan, "Listen, I'd like to come back and meet more of the leadership team and spend more time with you, go a little deeper on what this means." And so we extend our courtship by another week or so, and I'm super impressed by the rest of the leadership team and the product thinkers and the designers and things that I was going to get to work with on a daily basis. And so I take the job full knowing that it's going to be wildly different than Pandora, where I had all of this latitude to do whatever I might want to do, and in the context of Snapchat, at best, I was going to be Evan's right hand, a person that principally executed his vision.

(00:59:29):
And that's certainly what it was. I mean, Evan and I ended up having a really great collaboration, but it was certainly most days, I was executing on his vision, both at a high level, and very much in the details. And Evan's truly brilliant, I mean, and he's also actually a really nice guy. I think in some ways, he gets a bad rep for... He has very high standards, but he's a very kind person, in my experiences with him. But it was a super exhausting job and not as soul satisfying as I wanted it to be. And after a couple of years, like I said, I thought maybe I just wanted to make croissants or something.

(01:00:14):
But one really, really big important lesson that I learned at Snap is about risk taking. And when you have the financial support and the foundational relationship with your investors that Evan has, it really allowed him to take these really big swings, acquire a technology that he thought was game changing, build features speculatively that maybe would be pruned in any other product roadmap planning process because the odds of them having an outsized impact were modest. And it just allowed him time after time to make bets that paid off, and we forget about the ones that don't work when there are so many home runs in those years. And we didn't have... Environmentally, we weren't set up for that at Pandora, but I think in some ways, I wasn't temperamentally inclined to those kinds of big swings. And I think I take bigger risks and encourage bigger swings now because of things I learned from Evan and Snap.

Lenny (01:01:18):
That is an awesome story. It resonates a lot with what Brian shared about how he thinks about product now and just telling people what to build versus very bottom up, "Tell us ideas you have." That impact, the way you run, we're going to talk a bit about you as CEO now, but I guess, do you have a place that you try to be of CEO as, "Here's what we're building"?

Tom Conrad (01:01:40):
As a product-oriented CEO, how much you should lean in to the details versus set direction and create an environment where great people can do great work, I suspect there's not one answer that applies to every company stage. When I was at Apple, one of the reasons that we struggled to ship things is that Apple did a great job of assembling incredibly, incredibly smart and talented people. Just everyone around me at that early stage in my career was so, so inspiring. But one of the side effects of that is we would get in a room and we would turn over some problem or opportunity, and we would talk ourselves out of every good solution because it wasn't perfect. I used to joke that Apple was the only place in the world where a vote of a thousand to one was a tie because that one person would be so thoughtful in their critique that the other thousand people would be like, "Hmm, that's right, that's right." And even though there's been this huge consensus of what the right answer was, we would talk ourselves out of making decisions.

Lenny (01:02:50):
That one wasn't Steve Jobs, necessarily? It could be somebody else?

Tom Conrad (01:02:53):
He wasn't there.

Lenny (01:02:55):
Wow.

Tom Conrad (01:02:56):
So I think what broke Apple out of that mode was Steve came back and they didn't vote anymore. Steve was just making the call. And so I have some sympathy for Brian and Evan, who have these big, thousands of people working for them. And as they delegate, they grow frustrated that there's not progress at the pace that they're looking for, and that there's indecision, and the people on the teams report that there's just churn and no progress, and there's fiefdoms and politics and all the rest, and that as the CEO, as a brilliant product-oriented CEO, they are uniquely situated to come in and cut through all of that garbage and get the trains running on time again.

(01:03:49):
Having said all of that, I also think that it can be a mistake to be that kind of leader in a smaller org because part of the opportunity in a small org is to assemble a group of people that are incredibly talented that believe in your mission and where who you can easily influence with a much lighter touch and set them up to build a culture in an organization that can execute. And so I see my job as CEO is to try to surf that edge of I'm really in the details. So I deeply understand the business and the product decisions that we're making and the processes that we're using to run the business, but not overplay my hand with respect to dictating outcomes.

(01:04:40):
The one thing you'll always have as CEO is, no matter how much you tell the team that when I swing by their virtual desk and say, "I've been thinking about this little detail that's not important right now, but what do you think?" It's like nine out of 10 times, that person is going to go and start working on that thing. And so you do have to be just really careful about the way you engage in some of those details, I think.

Lenny (01:05:06):
There's a really good episode I had with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he shared this framework called flash tags that they use at Coda, and I think it comes from HubSpot, of you tell people, "Here's what the subpoena is. Is it an FYI? Is it a suggestion? Is it a do this?" There's four of them and one's like, "I will die on this hill. You need to do this."

Tom Conrad (01:05:27):
I try to do a lot of that. I wish I could say that in my experience that that pays off. I spend an awful lot of time, even the stuff I say very clearly, just one person's opinion, focus group of one, "Don't change your priorities to go work on this," it has more of an outsized impact on people's behavior than I intended.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Yeah. Easier said than done. Coming back to your journey, we've talked through the story up until getting to Quibi, but two years ago, you went in a whole new direction, and you're now the CEO of a company called Zero. What is it like to move from just being a product leader or engi leader at a company to being the CEO for the first time? Why did you choose Zero as that role? And what have you learned as CEO that you wish you knew as a product leader or engi leader at a company that listeners might find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:06:19):
It's been a really, really incredible couple of years. In the aftermath of Quibi, I spent a lot of time, as we all do, soul-searching about what I learned and what I might want to do next. And as I thought about it, I realized that I really wanted to move on to something where I can have a direct impact on the culture and values of the company that I was involved in. I really got that opportunity at Pandora in a big way. And I had spent the five years of Snapchat and Quibi working for Evan and Meg and Jeffrey who are all incredible business leaders, but have their own very specific style and approach, and that leaves a mark on the culture that's unique to the founder.

(01:07:04):
And then as we've discussed, I'm always really interested in building things that are near and dear to me, and I was particularly thinking about what can I do that could have a really positive impact on the world in my next chapter. I've built an awful lot of media stuff through the years, video games and streaming services and so forth, and it seemed like maybe there was something that had a little bit more weight to it that I could spend my time on. And so my first thought was I would start something, a company idea I was quietly workshopping for some months. And completely independent from all of that, it's eight months into the pandemic, and my own personal health was at an all time low. I was 50 or 60 pounds overweight, my cholesterol was in the red zone. I mean, I was out of breath climbing stairs, which is something that I had never encountered in my life before.

(01:07:59):
I'm a bit of a yo-yo dieter and I'm always critical of looking in the mirror, but I was never ever really worried about my health, my longevity, and suddenly, I was. And so my solution to that was to go really deep on metabolic health, just thousands of hours of podcasts and videos and glucose monitoring patches and Oura Rings and digital fitness gear and just to try to understand the things that impact health and longevity. And as much as I would like to report that what I learned is that there's some magic pill that you can take, maybe some off label rapamycin or something, the truth is, is that to live a longer and healthier life, you really have to attack what I would call metabolic disease, which will manifest in overweight and obesity and pre-diabetes and diabetes and high cholesterol and all of these things that impact your long-term health.

(01:08:59):
And so I found Zero in this path and was using it to help with my own health journey. And Mike Maser founded the company four and a half years ago, and he and I were talking in this interval about my own experience with the product. I was just giving him product feedback and so forth, and he was telling me a little bit about his own entrepreneurial journey. And somewhere in the conversation, Mike said, "My intention is to step up into the executive chair role and to find a CEO for the company." So again, in my story, just over and over and over, this incredibly fortuitous thing happened. I just knew immediately that it ticked all the boxes, "Here's a chance to lead something that already had some momentum to impact the culture and values in a really direct way and was really, really close to my own personal journey."

(01:09:50):
And so we know we've got a great little company and 27 people, we've got more than a million users on the platform every month. Over a hundred thousand of them pay us with tens of millions of dollars of revenue through the years, and have had double-digit growth even coming out of the pandemic when lots of health and fitness companies saw retreats. And most importantly, it actually works. 75% of the people who use the platform lose weight. People lose, on average, five to 10% of their body weight in the first 60 days. And because of the success that people have, we grow just completely organically. We have no paid user acquisition at all. It's really a word of mouth business.

(01:10:31):
But that's not to say that it's not challenging. All startups are challenging. And what we've really focused on for the last couple of years is we've been really focused on unit economics, really trying to understand how much value can we derive and deliver for every person who downloads and installs the app, how do we convert them through all of the funnels efficiently and get them engaged with the product and get them to retain and drive that up in a really systematic way. And with my whole career, I'm definitely a person who started off thinking software development was mostly an art form, you find brilliant visionaries who have a deep understanding of human behavior, and they craft solutions for problems that other people don't see, and they make them delightful, and they get all the little details right. And when you found product market fit for the art, then you optimize them through a really quantitative take.

(01:11:34):
And so I'm definitely a person that sees both sides of that left brain and right brain equation that's important in software. But here's the thing my eyes have really opened to in the last two years. While companies are definitely the software that they make and the products that they deliver and that there is an art and science to that, as I described, there is also, if you step back, there is an equation that describes the business. It talks about how you turn investment into returns. And I suppose if I had come up with finance and been a business major that maybe that's the way that I would've conceived of companies to begin with. So maybe it's a little embarrassing that I had to be 53 years old before, I think, the scales fell through my eyes and I was like, "Oh, companies are equations."

(01:12:24):
And so when we first started talking about lifetime value and customer acquisition costs and getting those two things balanced and just the thinking about the unit economics of the business, my natural instinct was to go immediately to the leaf nodes of the equation like, "Oh, what percentage of people do we convert from install to registered and from registered to trial," and these very way down at the bottom of all the funnels and to ask the product team like, "Let's try to optimize these." And in the process though of trying to understand where we could take the business as we optimize those various dimensions and trying to understand too which of the dimensions had the most leverage, I started building these ever more sophisticated models that describe the whole business.

(01:13:16):
I mean, in startups, you get to wear a lot of hats. And definitely a hat that I'm wearing that I didn't anticipate at all is I'm the full-time FP&A guy for Zero. And so I built this spreadsheet that aggregates data from all of our business intelligence tools and raw data from our subscription transactions and looks at all of our historical results and all of our expenses and spend and then could use that to predict future scenarios by manipulating all of these variables. And it's just not at all the way I ever thought about products before. And I know that you've got lots of listeners like, "This guy's an idiot. This is a fundamental way to contemplate product work."

(01:14:05):
But if there's anybody out there like me who thought of it as art first and then optimization in the details, it is really, really powerful to spend the time to create the model that describes the whole thing so you can identify what are the high leverage points to focus on. So been doing a lot of that at the company in the last two years and it's really starting to deliver incredible results. Like everything in life, I mean, you sign up for things so you can learn, and that's the big one for me in the last year.

Lenny (01:14:36):
I really love that takeaway of as a CEO coming back to share, here's what you should be thinking about that the CEO is probably thinking about, as a product leader, you may not be, of trying to actually spend the time to think about the business model and understand it deeply because your founders are thinking about it all the time. And so if you're not, you're missing out on here's a way to influence them, here's a way to...

Tom Conrad (01:14:57):
It's so funny too because it's a thing I suddenly understand something that mystified me through my entire career, which was I'd go to board meetings and the investors would ask these probing questions, but they were really never about the product and what the product did and what the product roadmap was and what the features were and what this... It all seemed to operate at this level that was almost completely independent of the details of the "what is the solution you put into the world", which as a product-oriented thinker, was just completely baffling to me. And I now realize that they were tilling the soil that I'm talking about, they were tilling.

(01:15:39):
It doesn't really matter what the screens are and what the features are. I mean, it certainly matters, but that there's another higher order way to look at a company, which is really about the optimization of this equation. And I think particularly, if you sit on 25 boards, it's probably a much more efficient way to evaluate how your companies are doing and where to spend your time and how to help by thinking about them abstracted up at that layer. So I will never stop thinking about software development as being an art form and I will never stop enjoying the days when I get to lean in on the details, but it's been pretty eyeopening.

Lenny (01:16:18):
The other thing that stands out here, one is I think this is especially true for consumer subscription apps, which I've done some research on. And basically, they never work. There's Duolingo, there's Zero, which I didn't know how much scale you guys reached. My math here real quick. So you have a million users, a hundred thousand paying users. You charge at 10 bucks a month. I know there's a discount for an annual plan, but basically, you're making somewhere around a million dollars a month, which you don't have to confirm or deny it, but that's the math I just did, and that's crazy. So congrats. That's a rare successful consumer subscription app. It never happens.

Tom Conrad (01:16:53):
And like I said, every startup is hard, and I never stop being surprised at the new hard things that pop up every day. But we're on a really great run. We've had a tremendous year, and I'm just so, so proud of the team we've assembled. They're incredible for the last.

Lenny (01:17:08):
Part of the reason you're so successful is exactly what you said. There's a huge focus on LTV/CAC, the math formula, because for these sorts of businesses, the crux of it is can you acquire people for less money than you need to spend?

Tom Conrad (01:17:21):
One thing that's really fortunate for Zero is Mike Maser, who founded the company, and I have both been around the block long enough and enough times that we remember 2008, we remember 2000. And so in these moments in the pandemic, there were companies in our category that were raising hundreds of billions of dollars with the intention of throwing it at paid user acquisition. And we made a conscious decision to optimize the value of the organic traffic that we were getting and to drive our growth through LTV expansion rather than top of funnel expansion, which was candidly not in fashion in 2021, 2022.

Tom Conrad (01:18:00):
... in 2021, 2022. It turns out it's much more in fashion these days as companies are called upon to be much more capital efficient than they were during the pandemic era. I guess I feel somewhat fortunate that my natural inclination as an entrepreneur is more in sync with the expectations of the market than it was for a while.

Lenny (01:18:27):
Okay. So you've probably had the longest career arc of anyone I've had on this podcast. You've worked at all of these different companies in a lot of different phases. You're still at it. And I'm curious what you've learned about how to maintain your mental health and avoid burnout essentially through this journey. You mentioned you take some time off. Is there anything else you found or is that a trick of just how to not burnout?

Tom Conrad (01:18:51):
Do you know this Japanese concept called Ikigai?

Lenny (01:18:55):
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but share it. Share it for folks that may not be familiar.

Tom Conrad (01:18:59):
So the idea is it's a Venn diagram and there are four spheres. There's a sphere that's labeled what you love. There's a sphere labeled what you're good at. There's a sphere labeled what the world needs, and there's a sphere called what you can be paid for, and where they all intersect is this Japanese idea, Ikigai. It's the intersection of what you're good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. If you find that, it's Ikigai. And interestingly, your listeners should go and find this because there are interesting ways to label the other intersections, the intersections where all four don't come together. And what's really interesting is that the ones that are three but not four, I think because they're the ones that are close but not quite to this really satisfying thing. And so it's like when you find those, it's really easy to choose a job or to choose a path where you have three but not four, which is a really great recipe if you're feeling like there's something just out of your reach that's really important.

(01:20:09):
Anyway, it's a great framework to think about your life and your career. So to start, I'm incredibly lucky that it's all Ikigai for me. What I'm good at, what I love, what the world needs, what I get paid for, they have always overlapped. And a big part of it is just what I love is this world. I love software, I love building software, I love writing software, I love using software. People are like, "What are your hobbies?" I don't think I have any hobbies and I think about, "Well, what kinds of things do I do on the weekend for fun?" And it's like I'm teaching myself After Effects or something, which I will immediately forget, but it's just fun to go really deep on some piece of interesting software.

(01:21:02):
So I'm very lucky. And so I think that has been super sustaining for me. One of the reasons I've been able to do it as long as I have without really burning out is that just, it's what I do. And in some ways it's why I come back to it. It's easy to say, "I'm going to become a pastry chef," but left to my own devices, I use software, I make software. It's my hobby, it's my passion, it's all the things.

(01:21:29):
But a couple of thoughts about how one engages with their work. One thing is I'm really not a #hustling kind of leader. There was a woman that I worked with on the Finder just out of college that left a really big mark on me. My own style of work then, I think I mentioned my memory of flashing, blinking the folder animation was a 2: 00 AM kind of thing. I was 23 years old. I woke up at 11 o'clock in the morning. I went to the office, I screwed around and played video games in the Apple Arcade and went to a couple of meetings and had lunch and stood at the whiteboard and pontificated about some nonsense. And then about four o'clock every day I would start writing software and I would write software until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and then I would go out to dinner with people from the team in the middle of it and whatever.

(01:22:29):
And so it kind of looked like I spent 14 hours a day, six or seven days a week at Apple, and I was celebrated for this. There was lots of nights where I would work clear through the night and my boss would come in the next morning, he'd be like, "Are you still here?" And I'm like, "I'm still here. Look at this cool thing I did." And I got a lot of attention for that. And then there's this woman on the team who showed up every single morning at 8:30, sat at her desk, wrote a ton of great software, and every night packed her stuff up and left. And she contributed more than I ever did. And I don't think she got the same kind of recognition that I got because of the way she did the work.

(01:23:11):
And when we were building the team and culture at Pandora, I thought about her a lot and really made a point of saying that I just wasn't interested in performative contribution, that it's the work that matters and what I want to celebrate is if you can show up and do it and go home and have other things in your life, because I think that's a recipe for being able to do it on a sustained basis rather than burning yourself out.

(01:23:38):
I think there's some nuance in this. I think 22 year old me was always going to want to work through the night. And so I think creating space that that's okay too is important. And I think maybe in some ways at Pandora it was almost like that wasn't okay. It was like, "You should be taking more breaks. Why are you going this hard?" But I do try to create environments where people have a reasonable balance between their regular life and their technology life or room for that if they choose it. And I do think that that has through the years, has helped me keep at it, but I still work a lot of nights and weekends because I love it. It's what I do.

(01:24:16):
Here's the other thing. I got very, very lucky with the Pandora experience and got this outsized, probably inappropriate financial reward for being a part of it and gave me options that I never imagined that I would have. And so after 10 years I left and I didn't know what I would do, but I did really need a break. It was a really hard job and that was definitely a moment where I needed some time to recover. But I think if you had asked me on that first day, I would say, "I don't know why these people find success and then start another company right away. Why? There's so many things you could do in the world, why would you start another company? It's so hard."

(01:25:02):
And I was particularly in love with the idea that I had access to experience. I didn't really care about things, I didn't want a fancy watch or whatever, a car, but I wanted to see the world. And so I thought, "I'm going to just go and I'm going to live in London for three months, then I come back to San Francisco for a month. I'm going to go live in Mexico City for three months and I'm going to just have this life where I'm soaking up experiences." And after doing that for six months, the thing that I came to realize is that what I care about way more than experiences is relationships. If you're the person who is constantly on a plane seeking out some new experience, it's really hard to form and maintain intimate, satisfying relationships.

(01:25:47):
So I went back to San Francisco, I'm like, "I can't be all over the world if I want to be engaged with friends and like-minded people." And you know what people do on Monday morning? They go to work. And so if you want to be engaged with humanity, where they are on Monday morning is at work. And so more than I had the itch to build things, which I do very much have, I had the itch to collaborate, to be in the game with other people. So that was what took me to Snapchat, took me out of chasing experiences and took me back to building again. And then as we've already described, at a point I thought, "Well, I care about this collaboration, but maybe it doesn't need to be software that I'm creating in the world." And Quibi gave me a chance to fall back in love with that process again. And here we are, more software.

Lenny (01:26:48):
Plus being on a board of a hardware company. What you just shared reminds me of Mark Manson's book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. Have you read this book?

Tom Conrad (01:26:58):
I have not.

Lenny (01:26:59):
Okay. It sold a bazillion copies, and the core of it is that we get joy out of solving problems and we think we'll be happy when we have freedom to do nothing. But it turns out freedom is only helpful to help us discover the problems we just want to keep solving.

Tom Conrad (01:27:16):
Yeah, totally. I think that's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:27:20):
It sounds like that's the experience you went on. Last question, this new segment, I'm going to call Contrarian Corner. And the question is, is there something that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't?

Tom Conrad (01:27:35):
There's a segment in our industry that believes this very intensely, which is there's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. And I think in some ways our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. I use an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere, that would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has, as I described, the mathematical formula that's going to win, that has the market opportunity that's the right size, that has the 10X thinking that can really... And I'm a little biased here because while I am a CEO for the first time now, I've never been a founder and I've been lucky enough to find a bunch of young teams that could benefit from my skills and enthusiasms, and sometimes to some success and sometimes to some embarrassment, but always really, really interesting.

(01:28:53):
Yeah. If you're out there and you think that the only possible way you can be successful in this industry on any metric, whatever metric you care about: you want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want any of the things that people aspire to, outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Lenny (01:29:24):
I 100% agree with that. I'm always telling people, "Don't start a company. It's super painful, very rarely works out. It's so hard." I don't know what's harder, being a product manager or being a founder, probably being a founder. They're both very hard.

Tom Conrad (01:29:37):
Yeah, it is quite hard too. Yeah. Yeah. And just to be perfectly clear, there's something really special about founders. At both Pandora and now at Zero, the actual founders have from time to time said, "Well, you're like a founder." And I'm like, "I'm nothing like a founder. You took all the risk. When I showed up, there was a team and there was momentum and there was money in the bank. I appreciate your desire to say complimentary things, but 'You're like a founder' is not one that I'll take."

Lenny (01:30:08):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tom Conrad (01:30:11):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:30:13):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Tom Conrad (01:30:17):
I really love Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook. It's organized into chapters about foundational company building, building a leadership team, building a board, and in addition to the thoughtful synthesis on that topic from Elad, he has an interview of someone that he does relevant to that section on each of the chapters. Really, really great read and super actionable if you're a leader in a young company. In a completely different end of the spectrum, I love big, complicated science fiction and there's a lot of garbage science fiction out there to be sure, but when you find something special, it's the best. So probably through the years in that category, there's a book called Hyperion by Dan Simmons. That's just a total classic. Everybody should read it.

Lenny (01:31:08):
I read that. I think I read the first couple in the first one.

Tom Conrad (01:31:11):
Yeah. There is a sequel that's exceptional as well. And it's probably worth warning your readers that Hyperion is quite long and has an absolute cliffhanger.

Lenny (01:31:21):
I think they're making a show out of it, which is going to be wild. I don't know how they do a show around that book. I thought you were going to say this other book, A Fire Upon the Deep. Have you heard of this book?

Tom Conrad (01:31:29):
Oh, that's so good too.

Lenny (01:31:31):
Okay. That's also very complicated, but incredible.

Tom Conrad (01:31:34):
Yeah, I had completely forgotten about that. That's a very special book. There's a couple in that series too.

Lenny (01:31:40):
Yeah, I think I only read the first one. Also, Three-Body Problem is the other one that I always think about. It's come up a couple of times on this podcast. Let's move on to the next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or a TV show?

Tom Conrad (01:31:53):
I consume a lot of video content, both stuff that I'm very proud to talk about and stuff that I'm less proud to talk about, but I really liked the new Damon Lindelof show that's on Peacock called Mrs. Davis. So Lindelof, of course, from Lost and the new Watchmen on HBO, and Mrs. Davis is about an AI that you wear in your ear, like the HER AI and a nun that is hell-bent on the AI's destruction, and it reads like an early Coen brothers movie. It's super darkly funny and really, really thoughtful and unlike too much streaming, I think it's seven episodes, and it is a perfectly encapsulated story that has a beginning, middle, and an end and doesn't need to ever have another episode. It's amazing. Get yourself a Peacock subscription for at least a month to watch Mrs. Davis.

Lenny (01:32:56):
Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Tom Conrad (01:32:59):
There are two things about interviews. The first is I always encourage people when they're thinking about their interview questions to take any question that they're tempted to pull from their own current experience with the goal of trying to, how would this person solve this thing that I'm working through right now? Because just causing the other person to speculate and oftentimes about your own business, I think you know really well that they don't actually know anything about, it creates this imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee that feels out of sync with how I think about the collaborative nature of a great interview. So I tell people that almost every interview question should start with, "Tell me about a time in your career when..." to give them permission or to set their expectation that I'm asking them to tell me about something they've actually done that is relevant to the topic that I'm probing.

(01:33:59):
So that's just a structural thing that I try to do. And then usually towards the end of the interview, I ask almost everybody, "Imagine that you had a really great day at work. What was it that you did on that day?" Because what I'm trying to figure out is left to their own devices, what do they go to naturally because it rewards them? Because I think it's really important to find the highest best use of everyone you hire. And sometimes you can get a little bit to the bottom of what's the highest best use if you understand the things where there's a natural reward mechanism because it's like, "Well, I had this great day. I'm going to do more of that tomorrow." "What was the thing?" And it's just pretty illuminating.

Lenny (01:34:45):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Tom Conrad (01:34:49):
I have bought every pair of headphones on the planet, in part because Apple's headphones do not stay in my ears. I've sneezed one across the room, I've lost one down a drainpipe. They don't stay, none of them, the wired ones, the not wired ones, the in-ear ones, and it's left me feeling honestly like I am some kind of anatomical freak. I look at other people wearing them, I'm like, "What is going on with their ear that it's just staying there perfect?" It seems inconceivable to me. Nonetheless, I have a pair of AirPods Pro's that I want to love and put up with the fact that I'm going to drop them, lose them, sneeze them across the room.

(01:35:32):
But recently I came across this product from a company called Eartune that they're replacement tips and they just have the littlest bit of compression foam on them. They don't make the AirPods so big that they won't fit in the recharging case or anything, and they work. Miraculously, they stay in my ear. And Apple has this feature called Size Fit or something, go in settings, find your AirPods, scroll all the way down in the settings, and you can run this test where they play some audio and they tell you how good the seal is. And that revealed that my right ear is weirder than my left ear. So I actually have to use different tips in either sizes. Suddenly this sounds like a vaguely disgusting conversation that we're having. Anyway, I'm just really thrilled about my ability to wear Apple's AirPods after all these years.

Lenny (01:36:32):
I think what we're learning is you are a mutant, your ears are different. Cool. We'll link to that product in the show notes.

Tom Conrad (01:36:40):
Okay.

Lenny (01:36:41):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either in work or in life that you find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:36:48):
You can't be a product person without having an eye rolly Charles Eames quote that's at the center of your existence. And for me, the Charles Eames quote is, "The details are not the details. They make the design." And I just really absolutely believe that, that the devil is in the details when you're a product designer and be uninterested in nuance at your peril.

Lenny (01:37:14):
Final question. You worked with the creator of the GIF format. How does he pronounce, giff or jiff?

Tom Conrad (01:37:22):
Yeah. So before all of this, I worked at a company called CompuServe when I was in high school.

Lenny (01:37:29):
CompuServe, I used CompuServe. I didn't know that. That's amazing.

Tom Conrad (01:37:33):
There was a guy on the team named Steve Wilhite who invented Graphics Interchange Format, GIF, and he was a straight out of central casting, 1960s neck beard programmer type, and the first I had ever encountered and very prickly. And it's crazy, but at the time, Steve would take all comers in the fight that it was pronounced jiff. Now he's obviously wrong. It's obviously pronounced giff. It's crazy to me now 35 years later, this is still a topic that pops up on the internet every once in a while. It's somehow like Zelig, I cross paths with the guy who created Graphics Interchange Format and I know his opinion on the topic even though it's an unpopular one.

Lenny (01:38:35):
Got it. So he likes jiff, but you agree it's giff?

Tom Conrad (01:38:38):
It's definitely giff. It's obviously giff.

Lenny (01:38:40):
Okay, great. We're on the same page. We've decided. Let it be known.

Tom Conrad (01:38:44):
Let it be known.

Lenny (01:38:45):
Tom, we've talked about successes, we've talked about failures, mental health, general health, all kinds of awesome stories. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some other questions that I didn't ask, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tom Conrad (01:39:00):
I'm @tconrad on all the socials, from Twitter to Threads to Instagram. My DMs are open everywhere, and I would absolutely be delighted to hear from any of your listeners on any topic that they choose. And what can you do for me? I would love for folks to download Zero and give it a try and send me some feedback about what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong, and we'd love to have our little product be part of your life.

Lenny (01:39:32):
Awesome. Tom, thank you so much for being here.

# Why AI is disrupting traditional product management | Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO)

## Transcript

Tomer Cohen (00:00:00):
When we look at the skills required to do your job, by 2030, it will change by 70%. So whether or not you're looking to change your job, your job is changing. In order to stay competitive, you actually have to go back to some first principles, go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn that fully embraces what AI unlocks.

Tomer Cohen (00:00:24):
We call it the full stack builder model. The goal itself is to empower great builders to take their idea and to take it to market, regardless of their role and the stack and which team they're on. It's really fluid interaction between human and machine.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
This feels like this could be a model for how a lot of companies operate and how product ends up being built in the future.

Tomer Cohen (00:00:42):
Change management here is going to be a critical part, but it's not enough to give them the tools. You have to build the incentives programs, the motivation, the examples to how you do it. I see a lot of companies roll out their agents and just expecting companies to adopt. It doesn't work this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
There's always been this question, is AI going to just make people that are not amazing, more amazing, or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing?

Tomer Cohen (00:01:01):
Top talent has this tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft. The key trait that I'm emphasizing for builders is...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Today, my guest is Tomer Cohen, longtime chief product officer at LinkedIn, who is piloting a new way of building that I think will become a model for how companies operate in the future. It's called the Full Stack Builder Program, and essentially the idea is to enable anyone, no matter their function, to take products from idea to launch. They've scrapped their APM program and replaced it with an associate full stack builder program. They've introduced a new career path with the title Full Stack Builder that anyone from any function can become. And as you'll hear in the conversation, they've built a bunch of internal tools and agents and processes to basically build a human plus AI product team that can move really fast, adjust to change quickly, and do a lot more with a lot less. If you're looking for inspiration for how to rethink how your team operates and to lean into what AI is unlocking for teams and companies, this episode is for you.

This episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly, and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun.

(00:03:56):
But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers. Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision, and instead show it to them. Make code-backed prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny.

(00:04:42):
Tomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tomer Cohen (00:04:45):
Thank you. It's great to be back.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:47):
It's great to have you back. I'm really excited to be chatting because you're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn that fully embraces what AI unlocks, kind of leans into what is now possible, and to me, this feels like this could be a model for how a lot of companies operate and how product ends up being built in the future. There's a lot of product leaders that are talking about AI, what they can do. It feels like you're actually doing this in a really, really radical way, and so I'm excited to learn from you to hear about this for listeners to understand what you're seeing, what you've learned. Let me start with just why did you decide this was necessary? Why are you rethinking all of these things about how product has been built for a long time? AKA, why do people need to pay attention to what we're about to be talking about?

Tomer Cohen (00:05:34):
It really starts with kind of the basics. For me, technology has always been about empowerment. It's not about what it does for us. It's about what enables us to do. And now we have this amazing opportunity in my mind to make it about meritocracy, and I think it's an opportunity, but it's also a necessity right now, and I want to put this in context where we're entering this phase where the time constant of change is far greater than the time constant of response. Basically means that change is happening faster than we're able to respond to it. Now, LinkedIn has this unique view of the world of work. So we actually have some pretty, in my mind, mind-blowing stats to put this in perspective. When we look at the skills required to do your job, by 2030, which is literally four years from now, sounds a long time, but four years from now, it will change by 70%.

(00:06:25):
So whether or not you're looking to change your job, your job is changing. The only question is, do you keep it? And then we look at organizationally, the fastest growing jobs right now, the most in demand jobs in the market are growing by north of 70% from last year's fastest growing job. So there's a new kind of iteration of what you need as an organization to thrive. And then you apply that to building products and you realize that in order to stay competitive, you actually have to go back to some first principles, go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building. And what I love about this is when you think about the role of a builder, which the builder is at the heart of company, the goal is actually quite simple. The builder takes an ADN, she brings it to life. That's really the process, right?

(00:07:11):
And we all build those, let's call them best practices. You research the problem really well, you spec it out, you design it, you code it, you launch it, and you iterate. That's basically it. But what happens at many at scale companies, LinkedIn included and many other companies, over time that process became very complex very quickly. So what happened? We took every step and we expanded it to a lot of sub-steps. Researching, the problem became looking at for us 10 to 15 sources of information, obviously talking to customers about doing data pools, looking at feedback tickets in multiple sources, social media, interactions with customers. We probably have 10 to 15 sources of information we go for before we feel like we have research department really, really well.

(00:07:58):
Think about reviews for product. There is design reviews, privacy reviews, security reviews. I can go on and on and on. And each one of those substeps actually has a valid reason to exist. But when you add a whole thing together, you're like, "Oh my God. This is why it takes, to build a small feature, multiple teams, multiple code bases, multiple sprints just to get it out to launch," and not talk about iterating, which is actually where you seek success. You never see success in the launch itself. So really the work itself is not complex, but the process we made very complex. And when I was digging in, I found it doesn't end there because somebody has to do all those substeps, so what happened is you actually move from process complexity to organizational complexity as well.

(00:08:41):
And then you actually led to microspecialization. All those subsets are doing by somebody specific. So from one builder, we have multiple functions. Obviously we have engineering, product and design, and you can start questioning those lines. At least I am internally. And from there, we have a lot of subspecialties. It happens in every one of those functions, but imagine design. We have interaction design, animation design, content design, research. There's so many aspects to that. So they're all valid, but they all have people, and that entire process basically means a lot of... It's basically bloating. It's complexity. And then without noticing, you end up with this massively complex... We actually have this diagram that basically shows the process complexity, organizational complexity together.

(00:09:26):
And usually people are mind blown because they're working on one thing very specific, but when you zoom out, you have this overwhelming experience you're kind of thinking about. And now we have this real opportunity to collapse the stack backup, go back to craftsmanship, rethink the product development lifecycle, which is where the full stack builder model comes to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):
Wow. Okay. And there's so much here. We're going to be showing the visuals as you talk to help people see what you're explaining here. And all of this is very rational. If you have 15 sources of information, why not pull from it? Why miss out on that stuff? And what you're describing here is as you get more power and more specialized... It all makes sense rationally, but when you start to step back and look at this like, holy shit, it takes six months to launch one feature. I want to ask about the stat you shared. I think this is an incredibly powerful stat and you have very unique data here to tell you this sort of stuff. So you said that something like 70% of the skills that people will need in the future are going to change.

Tomer Cohen (00:10:28):
To do their current job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:29):
To do their current job. And what is this looking at? Is this just based on historical data or how do you find that?

Tomer Cohen (00:10:36):
Yeah. To be fair, there was always a change, right? So it was never about just keep the skills you have today, but we've never seen such a dramatic part of your role today. So whether you are a marketer right now or a seller, a recruiter, an engineer. Engineering is where a lot of the investment is going in right now in terms of agents. Those jobs will change dramatically. I remember I said my role, my life as an engineer and even then it's changed materially after 10 years, and then the change we're seeing right now, just thinking about in four years, what did it take to actually engineer really, really well would be dramatically different, or to build software, to build an artifact of some sort. But it's true for almost every function. It's not equal. Some job like nurses will see less impact, but some jobs will see 90%, 95% impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:28):
There's also a stat that I don't think you mentioned here that I saw on the post when you first talked about this program is that 70% of today's fastest growing jobs were not even on the list of jobs a year ago.

Tomer Cohen (00:11:39):
Yeah. No, so this is the fastest growing job on the list were not there a year ago, and then many of them don't even exist a decade or two ago. There's actually some pretty amazing stats across the board.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:52):
Okay. So let's talk about this program that you built. Tell us the name and then tell us the gist of what it is today and the vision of where you want it to be.

Tomer Cohen (00:12:03):
Yeah. So we call it the full stack builder model. And the goal, always start with the goal. The goal itself is to empower great builders to take their idea and to take it to market, regardless of their role and the stack and specifically which team they're on. And the idea ultimately is to be able for that builder is to develop experiences end to end, to combine skills and expertise across what was traditionally distinct domains to bring it all together. And it's not a sequence of steps. It's really a fluid interaction between human and machine. That's how the way I see it. And then when you look back at that product development life cycle from the idea, the insight all the way to launch, the key trait that I'm emphasizing for builders is where I want them to spend their time is where I think great builders should shine in.

(00:12:54):
So the idea of vision. Coming up with a compelling sense about the future. Empathy, super critical, right? Having a profound understanding of an unmet need. Communication is critical. And we see this a lot in job descriptions right now for almost every role, but ability for you to align and rally others around an idea. Creativity, which for me is about coming up with possibilities beyond the obvious. For example, I don't think AI yet is great at creativity. I think it's kind of, in many ways, brings back the things you might not know about, but it's not the kind of next level creativity, which I think still humans are much better at.

(00:13:33):
And then ultimately what I think is the most important trait for a builder is judgment. Some people call it test making, but it's making high quality decisions in what is complex ambiguous situations. Everything else, I'm working really hard to automate. Really, really hard. And then when you think about the outcome, it's not just about having more shots at the goal, which I think people go like, "Oh, the iteration speed is going to be very high." Yes, but what you're really doing to an organization of at scale organizations is they're a lot more nimble, a lot more adaptive, a lot more resilient. They can navigate the future. They can actually match the pace of change to the pace of response.

(00:14:13):
And an analogy I have in mind is kind of Navy SEALs. You come to training, they're all kind of learning, they're cross-trained, across multiple areas. What they specialize in is the mission and they operate in small pods and they're very nimble and you can assemble them very quickly. And I think that's going to be the organization that will win in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:33):
Okay. So the simple idea, if you're just to boil it down to a sentence, the idea here is there's a builder who goes through the entire product development process essentially on their own. They have an idea, they research, they do data, they prototype design ship. That's kind of like the vision of where this goes?

Tomer Cohen (00:14:50):
Yes, but it doesn't have to be on their own. It's not like... I still believe in teams.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:51):
Got it. So smaller teams.

Tomer Cohen (00:14:55):
Just smaller teams. Smaller teams and much more focused on the problem, the mission, per say, versus... Actually, one of the things we've done as an example, we started to do the idea of pods. We're no longer large teams. We assemble a team, ideally a full stack builders coming together and it's less about can I have an engineer design PM working together and trying to combine this trio looking at folks who can flex across and then they tackle something for a quarter or so and then we reassemble those two different pods. That's one example of an manifestation we're doing right now and seeing actually some great success in both in terms of velocity, but also in terms of that focus and nimbleness of that team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:37):
And it feels like the goal here, what you're trying to adjust and that broke as teams bloated as speed and adaptability and flexibility, because going back to your original point that change is happening so much more quickly now that companies that have been building in this traditional way just can't compete.

Tomer Cohen (00:15:56):
Yeah. It's not that you have to break the model. I think the model is broken. It's just this pace of change is helping us realize it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:03):
Okay. So then going back to the things that these builders still do versus what you want to automate. So the list you shared is they're responsible for the vision, empathy, communication, creativity, and judgment.

Tomer Cohen (00:16:16):
Yes. Yeah. And I would put a lot of the focus on the latter. I think if you ask me at the end of the day, what's the kind of most important trait? I would say it's that judgment, test making ability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:27):
And then in terms of what you're automating, what are some of the areas you've seen a lot of success in actually automating and where do you think this goes?

Tomer Cohen (00:16:35):
Yeah. So I think just to kind of break it to pieces, and I think this is... If you were a startup right now, in many ways you can start this way. There's no legacy code, there's no legacy structure you run. And in fact, a lot of the startups I talked to that are built AI natively, they're just working at full stack builders. That's the way they start. If you're at a company at a scale of ours and many others in the market, you're like, this is almost like a new production function and mindset that you have to do. And there's really three components that we're working on. One is platform. The second one is the tools and the agents. And lastly is the culture.

(00:17:17):
The platform one, this is the kind of level of investment you have to do before, before this actually starts, you start to see all the benefits accrue. But the platform for us as an example is rearchitecting all of our core platforms so AI can reason over it. So we're building kind of this composable UI components with server side that we actually build. We're basically building for AI to be ready to bring it in. So you can't just go and bring a third party tool and have it work on the LinkedIn stack. In fact, that's one of our biggest learnings. It never works. Never works. You have to bring it in and customize a lot of it, working almost in alpha mode with those companies to make it work internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):
So this is essentially re-architecting your code base to work more efficiently with AI. Is that one way to think about it?

Tomer Cohen (00:18:04):
Yes. And in many ways, working with those companies to adjust something in their stack to work with our stack as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):
When you say those companies, meaning the development agents like Cursors and [inaudible 00:18:16] and such?

Tomer Cohen (00:18:16):
Yes. Or Figma on design. Or you can think about design systems is another example of that. But you have to have that back and forth because they're not... In many ways, we haven't seen anybody be able to work off the shelf immediately on our code-based design systems and unique context we have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:34):
Just to follow that thread briefly, so there's Figma. That's interesting. So basically the way Figma exports and keeps your design system, that has to change to work better with AI is what I'm hearing.

Tomer Cohen (00:18:41):
They first need to know how to work with our design systems, which is something, in many ways a lot of those companies are working on. Same with coding. It doesn't work that you just bring it in and it just reasons over your code base really well. We tried. We are building that layer that basically allows it to do so, whether it's Copilot or Cursor, Windsurf and so on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Got it. Okay. Oh yeah, Copilot. Microsoft. I get it. I get it. Okay. Okay. So that's the platform. So that's an investment that you guys have to make to make AI effective at building and doing all these things.

Tomer Cohen (00:19:17):
And then you have tools. So tools is where you really build the agents. I mentioned I want to automate everything outside of those five trades that we talked about, and then we're building the tools for that. And then for that, actually very similarly, I can't just bring a tool from the outside and work. So I'll give you an example. One of our biggest things is building a trust agent. Trust is really important for us at LinkedIn. There's a lot of unique vectors which trust plays at LinkedIn doesn't place it anywhere else. So we need to bring all of that know how and context and information base into that agent. So we ended up building our own trust agent at LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
And so what is this trust agent doing? Telling you when you're maybe exposing information that you shouldn't be?

Tomer Cohen (00:19:58):
So when you build a spec, you build an idea, you walk through the trust agent and it'll basically tell you what are your vulnerabilities, what harm vectors potentially you're introducing or will be introduced as a result of that. And I had our head of trust build it. So the head of craft for every area is building their own agent. As an example, we have one of our features for job seekers is called Open to Work. If you're looking for a job, you can put an open to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:24):
Yeah, a little green loading thing on the circle.

Tomer Cohen (00:20:25):
Exactly. And actually it's a great signal. I've seen some great success from it. People are helping each other. The community really thrives around helping each other. But at the same time, it introduces a trust vector for bad actors because they're open to work. People who are looking for a job are potentially more vulnerable to scams than other folks. So being able to think about how do we prevent all of those ahead of time. So we walked that spec from a couple of years ago through the trust agent. Not only was it able to find all the stuff we initiated at the beginning, but all the holes that we did not catch until later. So that's a great example of something that actually worked really well.

(00:21:03):
That's one. The other one is a growth agent, as an example. Again, LinkedIn has a very unique... Actually, we have an incredible growth team, growth process. We've kind of funneled all of our unique loops, our funnels, our tests of the past, everything into this growth agent, and now you can basically rock your respect for it, your idea for it. And it would not just allow you to do it better. It would actually critique how good is your idea. This is something you cannot bring off the shelf. It's very unique to LinkedIn. So we had to invest dramatically in it. And one team which is using it right now, which is almost... I wasn't thinking about it at the beginning, but our UXR team, our UER team, the user research team is usually using that growth agent to understand out of all the things that are basically surfacing for members, which one has the biggest growth opportunity to have the biggest impact? That was not in the cards when we thought about that idea, but teams are basically funneling those ideas into this one.

(00:22:05):
An example is our research agent. So research agent basically is trained on the personas of our members. You can think about a small business owner, a job seeker and so on. And it's using not just world knowledge, it's using all the research we've done in the past, all the support tickets coming in. So it's pretty good at understanding that persona at LinkedIn. So one examples we had is a team came out with a spec. They weren't aware we had the research agent yet. I asked the research agent for a small business owner, wanted to think about the marketing spec we had, and it critiqued it extremely well. Actually, in many ways shifted the direction of the team to focus on other integrations tools we can focus on, but it's very hard to have that visibility all to all that corpus of knowledge inside of the company.

(00:22:56):
That's another example. We have an analyst agent trained on all how you basically can query the entire LinkedIn graph, which is enormous. And instead of relying on your SQL queries or data science teams, you can use the analyst agent. All of those I would say are, I would call them still MVP+. The goal for us in the next couple of months to basically roll them out externally. Externally, I mean, internally at LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:20):
Not as new product lines.

Tomer Cohen (00:23:22):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
Okay. So many questions. One is just how are you building this? Is there a platform you're using? What does it take to build an agent at LinkedIn? Is it all internal tools or is there third party use?

Tomer Cohen (00:23:31):
It's a great call. So I think we've been experimenting with a lot of tools. And I would say for a lot of those kind of knowledge corpus agents, we're using everything from Copilot Enterprise to ChatGPT Enterprise. By far though, the most important part was basically our own customization of it. That's been where we saw the biggest gains. Even building the orchestrator across those because you want the agents to start following to each other, the trust agent should work with the growth agent and go do a back and forth versus doing what more sequentially. So we've done a lot of work internally to make it happen. This is why I think it does require that level of investment.

(00:24:09):
And then in some cases, let's talk about the design agent that we're working with. We're working with multiple companies to try and understand which product works best for us. And interestingly enough, and this is another learning, different teams gravitate to different products. So that's something we'll have to resolve and think about how we do this really well, because ultimately we were trying to simplify the process as much as possible, but that was a big learning for us and which tools we use and how we basically integrate them in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
Got it. So you might have an amazing Figma agent, but some teams want to use a different design tool.

Tomer Cohen (00:24:44):
Yeah. So we've kind of experimented with Figma and Subframe and Magic Patterns and so on, and we saw people gravitating depending on the function, their level of visibility, their know how of the tool before, they're gravitating to different tools. And ultimately, I don't want to have eight design agents in the company, so we have to converge into at least a few. And I think it's similar across many areas because the appeal of those, a lot of those agents are trying to solve similar end goal, but they're doing it very differently. And what you'll see that ultimately, I don't think there's going to be a winner takes all because the starting point of the customer or the user will dictate a lot how simple they are for that use case.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:28):
Super interesting. The other interesting takeaway here is you're designing very specific agents that are one job to be done. Is that a very intentional decision? Did you try an agent that just is super intelligent on all these things?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:41):
Ultimately, they will do an orchestrator. We're going to really orchestrator across, but we did want to be able to rate and grade those agents really well on how they're doing. And I think there is a level of expertise. Now, we're kind of building this in a way where we'll be able to mask a lot of those. You might not know that there's a trust agent. You might have, we call this internally the product jammer agent that basically does your product jam, which is a process we do internally. You might just use the product jam engine, and that product jam agent will work with all the other agents. But now we're starting with that building blocks until we build the orchestrating layer across.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:20):
Another interesting takeaway from what you've been sharing is that so much of the work has gone into the beginning of the product development process, just like helping you craft the right requirements, clarify trust, and then here's product jam and here's the research we've done. And I imagine it's because coding has already been accelerated with all these IEE tools. Talk about just why that's maybe where most of the investment's gone and where you've seen the most impact so far.

Tomer Cohen (00:26:43):
Well, 100% our coding investment has gone, started a while back, and those are fall into place. We have our coding agent. In fact, we've kind of staged it into two parts of it. There is the idea to design part, and then let's call it the code to launch part. The code to launch part has gotten a lot of attention and we're making some big inroads there. Everything from the coding agent to what we call the maintenance agent when you have a failed build, it will do it for you. In fact, I think we're close to 50% of all those builds being done by the maintenance agent and a QA agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):
Wow. So this is when a break builds instead of engineers hopping on the issues that an agent fix.

Tomer Cohen (00:27:24):
You can still go and finish your coffee before you have to go and redo the build again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:27):
Extremely cool.

Tomer Cohen (00:27:28):
But we haven't had much investment until we kind of launched this program in the idea to design area. And that's a material part of work. It's also where the quality a lot of the work comes from, at least before you start to go into the coding phase. The idea is to empower everybody. So if you're an engineer, you can basically use all those tools at the front of the process and be able to be a full stack builder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:51):
How long did it take to get this kind of in place for you to actually form your first team to build these, the initial agents and some of this backend, redo the code base sort of thing?

Tomer Cohen (00:27:59):
I announced this internally end of last year, we really kind of started working, but it was more setting up the teams and the processes internally. We had our first MVPs of those agents I think like four to five months after it was really trained, I would say. But really the work itself has been kind of couple of months of dedicated work. A lot of it has been getting all the corpus of data together, cleaning it up. And that's actually a good learning as well. It's not great to just give it access to your drive and say, "Reason all over this knowledge base." It actually does a very poor job understanding importance of the past and putting weights on stuff. You actually want to think about specifically what the context when do you want to give it to and what's the knowledge base that you want to have it focused on. So even cleaning up, let's call them gold examples or golden examples to learn from, has been one of the biggest learnings. Just reasoning over your entire knowledge base did not work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
Yeah, that makes sense. There may be just like a researcher with a strong opinion about something that you disagree with and it wouldn't know. It's like, oh, of course, this is data, this is fact.

Tomer Cohen (00:29:03):
Exactly. And then it doesn't always understand ties to original specs to success. You have to actually build... This is a really interesting way. When you think about how you bring those tools in, you can't just bring them in. You have to know what you feed them with. And what you feed them with is not just access. I see a lot to just focus on the connectivity and integration and it reminds me of the... This is almost like, this is actually more than 10 years ago when I was co-rebuilding the team, co-rebuilding the feed at LinkedIn and we started from scratch and I had to literally sit down and filter through examples of what is a good professional post on LinkedIn and what is not. And this was like weeks of work getting up that golden sample of examples, but it wasn't... The most important part was feeding at the right data, not all the data.

(00:29:57):
So it requires work. This is where I would say for many companies who are thinking about this phase, and I do a lot of sessions today with CPOs and COs on this process. You have to put this initial work to get the gains after. When I think about it, I think there's a takeaway there in generally with AI, even if you're learning it for the first time and so on, whether it's Cursor or whether it's design, if it's Figma or other tools or Lovable, you should be ready to invest those hours before you start seeing yourself pick up in velocity and quality, which will come up, but you have to invest that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear. But a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's innovation workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes. You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's Canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:31:46):
What's the current state of the pilot? How large is it? How many teams are doing it? What kind of stuff have you shipped? Just give us a sense of today's world.

Tomer Cohen (00:31:54):
Yeah. I wouldn't say we are yet at a very high sample rate where it's kind of a high percentage of the organization, but we have a substantial part of the organization already using it to provide a lot of the feedback. We're seeing a lot of great examples. So the way I think about the benefits is a function of experimentation volume multiplied by quality. How good are those experiments divided by the time it takes to actually pull them out, like idea to launch. So on saving times, we're seeing, whether it's PMs, designers, engineers, saving hours of work a week right now, whether it's the analyst agent we talked about or the prototyping really quickly or the product jamming experience has been a big part of that. On the quality side, we're seeing insights discussions just be much, much better. And by the way, quality and time, sometimes they help each other because it's high quality, you don't have to spend as much time on something.

(00:32:52):
So we are seeing that applied in. And the volume, I wouldn't say we had a rate where I'm seeing a high percentage organization doing it yet, but this will come once we... We haven't GA'd this internally. That will come in the next couple of months once we have all the stuff in place. But we're seeing designers and PMs picking up bugs directly from Jira tickets, pushing them in, something we haven't seen before, and there's just an appetite for everybody to just join. So in fact, the biggest thing right now is everybody wants access. Everybody wants access to the tools to be able to do it together, and we just want to make sure it's good enough to make sure the whole organization can do it really well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:32):
So how is it that you're piling it? Is it some number of people have access to these agents and they just work the way they've worked with access to these tools? Or is there a team dedicated, this is the way you work now and this is it, and we'll see what happens.

Tomer Cohen (00:33:47):
So that's a great call. So basically we have a team building. It's the core team building the FSB track across all of R&D, FSB, full stack builder. And then there are pockets and pods of teams using it. So basically we are looking at specific areas that we're basically giving it to. The condition there is they give feedback. As a response for that, they make the tool better, so it's not just access. We want people who will use it. So one of your early adopters would be the ones who help [inaudible 00:34:15] up the product really well. So we're doing this in a pod model right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):
So it's like a pod within a larger team, like a designer, PM, engineer kind of group within... Is there an example? You have a part of LinkedIn that's trying this out?

Tomer Cohen (00:34:27):
Yeah. So if I think about some of our teams, whether it's... Actually, we just launched Semantic People Search and the Semantic Job Search as well. That team was using part of those tools to actually help build it. So that team actually, this was PMs building their own dashboards with those tools without waiting for design resources to come in. Then we have a design team who is now... This started really from the manager rolling this out. And in many ways, what I tell this team is, "Don't wait for the official GA. Start doing it. Start leaning in." We're seeing designers of that team starting to push PRs, which never happened before. And now other teams, they want to do this as well. So it's starting with this kind of grassroots experience. I would say the places have been very formal. I would say the beginning has been the top.

(00:35:22):
The product executive teams, basically we move from functional leaders, design, PM, BD, and so on to product areas leaders, and they basically rock across the stack and they also go for a 360 with all of those functions to see if they're really able to do a full stack building experience. Then we're also launching at the junior side a new program called the Associate Product Builder Program, where basically we used to have our APM program, which this is about it's ending this year. And then starting January, we're going to start having our APB program and they're going to come into LinkedIn. We're going to teach them how to code, design and PM at LinkedIn. They're going to go through a pretty rigorous training process, and then they're going to join those pods, and gradually we're going to grow that program to be a material part of LinkedIn as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Wow. So this might be the future of the APM program is this full stack builder APM-ish program.

Tomer Cohen (00:36:21):
In many ways, we've built some pretty amazing... I'm really excited for that group. I wish I could join it. But we build amazing training for them. And in many ways, we're going to use that training to think about how we roll it across the organization. We're kind of using the lens of you have great technical skills, but you're not an engineer at a company yet, or you have great design taste, but you haven't designed at scale in company yet, and we're going to teach you how to do it at LinkedIn, but the training we're going to use a lot to extend across the company as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:51):
Okay. So you have these programs, these pilots and these pods, and you said what you're looking at to see if this is something you roll out is experiment velocity times quality times time.

Tomer Cohen (00:37:01):
Divided by time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):
Divided by time. Okay.

Tomer Cohen (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
Got it. And I guess I know it's early, but just you said you're seeing that it's saving teams a few hours a week at this point, something like that?

Tomer Cohen (00:37:11):
Yeah. And I think the feedback has been the most important part. Right? The way to think about this is just like you build a product. So we're building this product internally and you want to experiment with some kind of early adopters who will give you feedback, and the feedback has been amazing. In fact, our top talent are the ones who are using this the most at LinkedIn. And the feedback from them has been incredible in terms because they're also willing to spend the time and give the feedback as well. And the response from them has been incredible in terms of like the quality of their output, the time they're spending on this to get the value back, their desire to be part of this and actually scale this and make this even better. So that's where a lot of the excitement has been from how they're using it and the quality we've seen there. I would say in six months or so, we'll be able to see a lot more of the organization use it and you'll start seeing those top line numbers will build as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):
That is a really interesting insight that the top performers are finding the most success, because there's always been this question, is AI going to just make people that are not amazing, more amazing, or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing? And it sounds like it's likely the latter.

Tomer Cohen (00:38:24):
Yes. And in many ways, it's surprising, it's not surprising. I've seen this also when we were... It's surprising because you want everybody else to be part of this and lean in. I think top talent has this tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft and this innate need to be at the cutting edge of how you build, and I think we're seeing this here as well. This is why I had this phrase I say with the team that if we build all those tools, will they use it? And I know right now the answer is no. It's not enough to give them the tools to use it. You have to build the incentives programs, the motivation, the examples to how you do it. They need to see other people being successful as well.

(00:39:11):
And I've seen this also when we're shifting LinkedIn from a desktop company into a mobile company. It was a very similar process. It's very hard. Change management here is going to be a critical part. I think I see a lot of companies roll out their agents and just expecting companies to adopt. It doesn't work this way. Some will adopt. That tends to be your cutting edge 5% of talent that just wants new tools and they have a bias for change. But the vast majority needs to work for change management in how they do it, and that requires being a lot more thoughtful about the cultural aspect of it, which is by far from me the biggest and most important thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:48):
Yeah. I want to spend time there. And it makes a lot of sense why people don't spend time here because they have so much to do. They got to ship things. Their days are already busy. You have to now carve out time to learn this new tool that'll not pay off for a while. So I get why people are like, "Okay, okay, I'll get there. I'll use it someday," but they don't. This idea of culture, when I saw you share this initially, this is the third piece of making this successful. So there's the platform of getting the code base ready for people for AI to work with. Then there's the tool, like the agents you've talked about, and then there's the culture. Is there more there that you can share of just what has actually worked in helping get people on board? One thing I heard is creating a little bit of FOMO of like, okay, only a few people can use this and you have to sign up to get access. What's worked in getting people to get on board?

Tomer Cohen (00:40:39):
Yeah. I think this is where I emphasize to people that getting everything done, the platforms, the tools is not going to be sufficient. It's a prerequisite for this to work, but not sufficient for this to work because it really requires you to invest a lot in the cultural aspects of how do you get people to lean into this one. And this one might feel slow at first, but I've seen this before with our transformation of thinking from desktop to mobile. And once it picks up, it actually maintains very high velocity. One, people are really incentivized by how you define expectations for them. So to think about what is the expectation of somebody in the role, whatever-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
So like changing performance review sort of things.

Tomer Cohen (00:41:23):
Very much so. So everything from how you hire to calibration and evaluation. And one thing I want to see there early is this kind of AI agency and fluency. Like I mentioned, the tools are there. The question is, would you use them? Because the tools will be good enough, but not great at the beginning. That's the classic thing of every good MVP tool. They're good enough, but they're not great. And then you kind of want to build that agency to make the tool better. We're in this kind of notion of we're going to make this better for LinkedIn together. Two is piloting success inside of your organization. That's the pod model where you're showing that not only this could work, it's actually having success. So we have even our partnerships team, our BD team, being able to go instead of relying on waiting for an engineer to help build the developer portal and build the connectors there.

(00:42:17):
Literally one of our head of partnerships just went and did it himself. Didn't even delegate to his team. And their goal is to say like, "Hey, I can do it. You can do it as well." Those examples are really, really powerful. I talked about the associate product builder program where we are going to be very focused on training. I think that will send a really strong message across the organization. People will see this talent and what they can do, and I think that will create that movement. But celebrating wins in all hands, highlighting people and showing those examples. One example we've seen recently, people really looked at it in a surprise lens, but then it kind of, I think, really opened up a lens for them. We had somebody in our user research team. We had an opening for a PM on the growth team, and that role was open for a while, and she said that, "I think I can do it."

(00:43:11):
And she used all these tools. This is a user researcher becoming a growth PM, not usually the career path you see, but she was excited about the area. She used all those tools, and she's now a growth PM on the team. And really, you can start thinking about her more as a full stack builder ultimately. But seeing those openings and then highlighting those two people, actually people who are doing this have been a great example of it. And then just making sure that those tools are accessible. People can provide feedback, you share a lot, has been an incredible part of this. It's not enough to be top-down directive that this is how we want to work. People want to feel like there are success stories. They feel like it's worth their time. It feels it's a movement they want to be part of, and then ultimately they can see successes in how they do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
I love this kind of comparison to the shift to mobile. We all went through that and there's all these stories of companies requiring you to show mobile mocks. That's the only way we're going to operate. Now everything you have to ship has to be on mobile, and it's interesting how similar this is to them, to that experience. And so a few things you just shared here just to kind of summarize some of the things that have worked for you. Showing wins, celebrating wins, showing people what other folks are doing with AI tools, creating a program that people enroll into and make it a little bit exclusive. This performance review piece is really interesting because that really will change people's behaviors. Here's how we get promoted. Have you actually already made that change to the PM? I guess it's every track, I imagine, not just product management. Have you already made that change or is it kind of like a work in progress?

Tomer Cohen (00:44:45):
So there was two aspects to it. Once I moved my team, my directs, we did 360 for them. So their 360 was, if you came from PM, you had the designers on your team rate you. And so that had its own, and then we shared those with them, and that had its own kind of motivation. But then we broadly took it across. So when we hire right now, we look for those. And then this upcoming cycle, we do a bi-annual. That's going to be part of the performance evaluation piece and we announce it to everybody. And for what, it's where people are excited to show. And they're excited to know how they're going to be... It's always about, like, "I want to know how I'm being rated or evaluated." So just being able to show those examples has been a big part of it.

(00:45:31):
The other thing I would say, it takes time for this program and its formality to roll out across the entire organization, and I was intentionally not trying to be quick at rolling this out to everybody because I think that just dilutes the value of it really quickly because it's not about... I could care less about your title. I care about how you work. So calling you a full stack builder is not what I'm looking for. Changing your mindset to a full stack mindset is what I'm looking for. You're thinking you can do the whole thing. You're looking at those tools and looking at how to do it.

(00:46:07):
So one of the things I've said is if you're looking for a formal reorg or declaration to start building differently, you're waiting too long. Look, my biggest thing is here's a permission for me to just not wait and just go. So whether or not you have the right tools or not, go build the tool, use a tool from the outside, bring it in, show those examples. In many ways, prove that you are a full stack builder in mindset before anything else come to mind. And that just naturally will happen, and that's also where we've seen some of our best talent just goes and leans a lot into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:41):
I love that. I was going to actually mention that quote. Someone you shared, you work with told me exactly that quote you just shared, so I'm glad you brought it up of just if you're waiting for a reorg, you're not thinking about it the right way. How do you encourage people to actually play with these tools on their own? Are you just like, "Go take a few days to play with AI?" Is it just try it? Or is there anything formal you've seen of just getting people to more try this on their own without joining this program?

Tomer Cohen (00:47:05):
A lot of the tools we've made, we've been sharing them regularly. A few of my all hands have been all about how to use those tools. But then at the same time, we're kind of inviting, have you found a new tool that works really well for you? Share it, show it. Again, it could be Slack, could be Messages, Teams and so on, how you do it. But the idea is really to start getting that investment in how things work. Actually, I think in general, you can feel overwhelmed by tools right now, by recipes and how to do things like what's your prompt and what's my prompt. But really it's finding something that kind of works really well, that can gravitate around and really invest in that's been those areas. But I think we've had this invitation to go and explore and go and bring in stuff that you think are great. And in many ways, bring others along on the journey. It's one good way to make the influence much bigger than a few folks who are doing really well with this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
Are there any surprises on the negative side that have come out of this, of PRD is just feeling like AI driven, people slowing down unexpectedly? Is there anything that surprised you of just like, "Okay, this is actually not great"?

Tomer Cohen (00:48:12):
Yeah, we mentioned a few of them. I was hoping for some tools to work off the shelf really well. It was never the case because we had to invest quite a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
Never the case.

Tomer Cohen (00:48:21):
Never the case. We had to invest quite a lot. And again, part of it is we just have a lot of legacy information and code based and knowledge and designs and so on. So a lot of the companies we work with are seeing this as a great growth opportunity for them as well to invest, but I do think it's a big area of investment as well. We talked about not just giving access to all of your context which we started with, and we were like, "Oh, here's access to all the drive, all information," failed miserably and hallucinates like crazy." People gravitating towards different tools, like our goal was to converge on tools, but that was pretty hard.

(00:48:58):
And then I think in terms of quality, we've just seen better quality, but I think it's because, again, where we are in the stage is still the early adopters and they're doing a few iterations in terms of how to do it. But I would say the tooling adoption is hard. And then I think for some people, this is important for me to kind of state, some people do not want to be full-stack builders, and that's completely okay. Some people see themselves in specialization, and I think specialization has a place and a role. So I didn't want the message to be across the organization I expect everybody to be a full-stack builder. I do not. I think there are system builders that empower full-stack builders, and then you have people who are specialized. But I don't think we need as many specialized people as we did in the past.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:46):
I didn't actually realize this until just now. So is this their title now instead of product manager engineer, they're full stack builder?

Tomer Cohen (00:49:52):
We have a full stack builder title formally inside the organization, and we are gradually putting people in that bucket.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:59):
So there's a whole career ladder that's forming. There's a whole... Okay. That's a bigger deal than I even thought. So where are you finding these folks mostly coming from, like product, engineering, design? I imagine it's a mix, but just is there a most common trend?

Tomer Cohen (00:50:13):
It's a mix. People listening, I would just think about just go over your org and imagine who can do it, who can right now flex across those functions, whether it is engineering, design, product, even BD, and what you'll find is there's already quite a few that can flex across.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
Interesting. Are there any functions you think are especially successful at this? Not to play any favorites, but I don't know. Are you finding like, okay? Or you could also not highlight any specific.

Tomer Cohen (00:50:45):
No, I think it's a mental model of how you do it. I think if I were to play what's the hardest craft to potentially learn, I think design has a lot more work to get the design agents to be really, really good. So I think designers have a little bit of a leg up in terms of others learning their craft than the vice versa. But I honestly think it's a mindset. I've seen designers code, I've seen PMs kind of design and do well. And this is why I think when you kind of step back and you think about people in your organization and who can flex, I think you'll see them show up in many areas. And what I think you'll find there is they have the agency, they're leaning into new things, they have the fluency, like they're already building new experiences and they have that growth mindset that they just want to get better, so it doesn't matter what they learn at school or what label somebody put in them when they join the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:44):
What I love about a lot of this is it's the easiest time to transition between different product roles than it's ever been. Design's moving to PM, and sure, or just moving to this new role, it makes it so much easier to, like you said, that researcher became a growth PM.

Tomer Cohen (00:51:58):
And this is probably my biggest advice slash motivation I give to the team because what I tell them is ultimately... By the way, this is for me as well. I think about it the same way. The incentives for you are so aligned with your organization of what we're asking for, right? Because we need you to change. We want to be a more agile, adaptive, resilient organization that can deal with the pace of change, but you want as well for your own career. You want to be at the cutting edge of how you build. So the incentives are really aligned between what you need for your own career and what the organization needs you to do. So there's that permission to go and do it for me is ideally kind of a tailwind in what they want to do more than anything else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:46):
Maybe a last question for people that are inspired and like, "Okay, this is what we need to be doing," any just tips for someone starting down this road to be successful at trying something like this at their company?

Tomer Cohen (00:52:58):
I would say I would start with the notion of how do you want to bring this just structure. I would think about the platform you need to build, the tools you want to bring, and then I would spend a lot of time on the culture. Platform and tools I think would be, again, a prerequisite, but not sufficient, and the cultural aspect is really important. I would think a lot about how you bring people along. So for one of the learnings we had that probably able to do it differently right now, if I were to redo this program was, for a while I was working very closely with my core team on it, the core kind of full stack building team that were in charge of building all this material, but the organization was always asking questions. "What's going on? Who is doing it? What are the tools?" And in retrospect, we could have done a lot more in the flow to just show them and get them to already use early tools or be aware of it versus doing a small team on the side.

(00:53:49):
So it's okay to start with a small team. I think it's really important. But at the same time, just making sure there's visibility across the whole thing is really powerful. Being patient and being willing to invest. I always give this example of, we always give this example of like, "Oh, look at this startup. They built this in a week." Yes, you can build lifestyle in a week right now if you start from scratch. It's actually not hard. But when you are trying to transform a large organization, you want to have this impatient about the goal and you have to have a high ambition, but being very thoughtful and patient about how you bring it to life and the key things you have to invest in. If you don't invest in your platform, I just don't see how this could be a successful outcome. If you don't invest in customizing the tools for you, then you're just going to get vanilla generic agents from the outside.

(00:54:39):
So being aware of the investment and making sure you actually allocate resource to it, this is kind of the classic, be willing to invest upfront so you can reap the benefit after, versus saying, "Hey, why am I not seeing us moving into 2X the productivity in a week?" That's not going to be this way. You can see it with some people, but starting to collect those examples and starting to really think about the transformation is really key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
This is so incredibly cool. I know that a lot of CPOs and heads of product and all kinds of leaders are reaching out to you trying to figure out what you've learned how to do this. So I love that we went deep on all these things. Just final question, is there anything else that we haven't shared that you think might be helpful for listeners to hear or maybe just to double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Tomer Cohen (00:55:26):
Whether you're in an organization, you're waiting for your leader to roll this out or you're a leader trying to roll this out, I would not wait. The first thing I've done, which I thought in retrospect was very hopeful is I did announce this upfront we are going to this mode. We're starting in pockets, we're starting in pods, we're building the tools, but this is the mountain we're going to go after, and in many ways, we're going to make it great. I also announced that this is not just an end state, it's a kind of continuous progress. There's no state we're going to get to as much as continuously just trying to be better. And in many ways, to compete, you just want to be better than others in how you build because the version of building will completely just transform itself every few years or so.

(00:56:13):
So do not wait. Really focus on the progress you're making, over communicate with your team, not just the vision, but also the progress you're making, almost like holding yourself responsible. If you're a leader, give yourself KPIs you share with your own teams or OKRs. And if you're inside of the organization, and I would say whether or not or not your CPO or your CEO is announcing this type of program, go do it or join an organization that does it so you can be at the cutting edge of how you build in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):
Tomer, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Tomer Cohen (00:56:48):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
First question, what are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Tomer Cohen (00:56:54):
I love to give trios of books that I really like. So my current trio is, they're very diverse in topics, so apologies if it's not falling all into tech. But the first one is called Why Nations Fail. It's a book I read a decade ago even more and the authors of it just won the Nobel Prize last year. And it basically talks about why does some nations succeed and some fail? And it's not the usual explanations we go for, which is, oh, it's culture, it's natural resources, it's the kind of religion. A lot of those tends to be the kind of immediate excuses people have. It kind of falls into two camps. Are there extractive or inclusive institutions? Can people participate broadly and opportunities shared or there are institutions that basically are supposed to be attracting from many and give to some.

(00:57:48):
So it's just an incredible way to just think about how you build a nation. And for us at LinkedIn, we think a lot about the idea of opportunities, so how you build a product as well. And it's just a good way to move away from easy explanations into what really makes a country really successful as well. Second book, it's called Outlive. It's really about the idea, it's kind of like the author, Peter Attia talks about the idea of medicine 3.0, which is really the notion of building personalized medicine, which I think in the world of AI will become incredible in the future. But it's all those, let's call those categories that you should think about for your life so you can just optimize your health as much as possible and goes for everything through fitness to diet to the biggest health factors you should think about. But it's a great long book. Then lastly-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
The one in my bookshelf behind me.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:42):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:43):
It's up top. You can't actually see it, I think.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:47):
And then lastly, it's a book that also came out many years ago, but it's called The Beginning of Infinity, which I really like, by Deutsche. It wasn't an easy read for me, but I love the idea. In fact, especially in products, I love the idea of cause and effect, like really finding great explanations for why things happen and then building on top of that your next iterations. And this book really pushes on the idea of explanations that only once we have a clear understanding of what things happens, then we can have breakthroughs on top of that. But until we get to a point of clear scientific breakthroughs, we are not going to make significant progress. But when you do that, it's really almost like infinite progress you can make on top of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
Naval's always talking about that last book. I think I bought it and it was just hard reading this.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:39):
It's not an easy read, at least for me. It wasn't an easy read, but it's a very powerful read.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Awesome. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Tomer Cohen (00:59:46):
Can I do a podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):
Absolutely.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:50):
So there's a podcast in, it's in Hebrew, it's called One Song, and it takes a song that generally is ideally popular and then goes really deep on the origin and the history of the song, and I love it. I love music and just dissects songs so well. It does a great job also in bringing to life the story behind it. So for me, it just goes back to you thought the song was about something, but then it goes really deep into the actors behind the song, and sometimes it's the words chosen or it's how the lyrics match the music itself, and I just really enjoy that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:30):
There's a podcast called Song Exploder, I believe, that is a similar concept that's not in Hebrew, in English, that I'll point people to if you love that one.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:39):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be a kitchen gadget, type gadget.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:48):
Can it can be a product I want to have, which I think is actually really easy to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
I love that. This is a product thinking 101 and just the vision of what you want to see.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:58):
So in my car right now, there's Alexa built-in, which is great because the kids can ask for songs all day long and it's a whole show inside of the car. But one of my favorite things to do when this has been doing it for well over two years is I go in and I go into voice mode.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:17):
ChatGPT.

Tomer Cohen (01:01:18):
Yeah, ChatGPT, and then just have a conversation, and that's just friction. I would love to have on my steering wheel a button that invokes my AI friend that can sit next to me in the passenger seat, and I just think that would be such a... I actually think it would [inaudible 01:01:36] rides for people. Just that movement, that's just like elimination of friction will transform the experience for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:43):
On that note, I recently discovered Teslas actually do this now. If you hold the right wheel, Grok appears and you could talk to Grok. So it's here. The AI has arrived. Yeah. I just did it by accident and then it's, "Okay, cool."

Tomer Cohen (01:02:01):
Great. So for me, if anybody from Rivian is listening, please bring this in the car.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:06):
Rivian's falling behind. Yeah. And you have to use Grok. It'd be cool if you could switch to different AIs because it has a personality. Just give me information. I don't need you to laugh and give me jokes.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:20):
Did you need to spend some time with it before or did it have any memory from... Did you bring any memory into it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
There's a logged out version and then you could just log in and it connects to your account. Yeah, it's extremely cool. No one's talking about it. It's crazy because I don't know if they launched it fully, but it just appeared.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:38):
Do you talk in the car a lot to it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
I don't use it that much, to be honest, but I should. My wife just doesn't love Grok. I think the brand of Grok is a specific brand. And so she's like, "Don't talk to Grok in here with me."

Tomer Cohen (01:02:52):
I love voice mode, so I use it all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:55):
Yeah, I love voice mode too. It just interrupts too often. That's the issue there, right? It's just it stops.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:59):
By the way, you can set it up. You can basically say like, "Hey, just let me finish."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:03):
I now know that. I'm learning so much. Okay. Two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life?

Tomer Cohen (01:03:11):
I think last time I talked about it, I most associated here with, I might be wrong, but I'm not confused, although I don't say it as much anymore. But I think the one I love, growth mindset is a second religions for us at home. And one thing I love about, there's a phrase there that is becoming is better than being, which I think ties into the FSB mode a little bit, which is you're always in progress mode, iteration mode. It's not about reaching a state. It's about the journey, the process. That's what you should fall in love with. It's about continuously growing and evolving without the negativity of it or there's no sense of FOMO there. It's just this continuous thing. If I look back a year from now and I look back, how much did I grow? How much do I know? What skills to do that again? Where are I becoming better? Do I feel like Tomer version 2026 versus 2025? What's the delta there? And I kind of love that as a way of thinking.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
A great segue to our final question. By the time this episode comes out, it won't be a secret that you're leaving LinkedIn after 14 years. Legendary run. You joined way before the acquisition, you helped them integrate. Just like the way LinkedIn was perceived 14 years ago is so radically different from the way it is today. It's actually really fun and interesting to be there versus how people for a long time felt about LinkedIn. So I guess the question just how you feeling and what's next? I imagine you're going to get a lot of calls from a lot of people, but what are you planning?

Tomer Cohen (01:04:48):
Yeah, so I feel proud. It's been an incredible ride at LinkedIn. The way I've got to know about LinkedIn deeply the very first time was when I moved to the Valley and I went to a lecture at Stanford about social networks in 2008 and Reid was there and he talked about the power of being a professional communities online, and I was very nerdy about it and thought it was incredible vision, had no plans to join and actually started my own company after. But as luck would have it, found myself joining a few years after and just thought the mission was incredible. So in many ways it aligned with my purpose and just was an incredible ride to be here.

(01:05:32):
And I also feel very grateful. I shared this with the company recently. I was starting to take learnings from my experiences here. A lot of it was from tough situations. We had a lot of tough situations at LinkedIn and hard calls and late nights, but you learn so much from those and I'm just incredibly grateful. And I'm excited. I'm excited. I have a bias for change. I have a bias for kind of positioning myself in a place where I can learn the most and learn a lot. And it's an incredible time to build, so I'm just excited to be thinking of new problem sets and new areas where I can go deep on and invest the next decade in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
I think it's going to take a long time for you to not feel like you're working on LinkedIn and to forget about all the things that you have been worrying about for so many years.

Tomer Cohen (01:06:20):
After you build something for such a long time, and I think you and I talked about it at one point, that I think one of the best traits for a builder is to become very passionate with what they're building. Really care. Not about the job. It's really care about the product. When you feel the pain when somebody complains and you kind of have this continuous discontent, and it's like for me, it's the notion of raising a baby. So yeah, it's hard. It will be hard. I will always think of LinkedIn as one of the babies I helped grow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):
Well, I'm excited to have you back someday when you figure out what you want to do next and or start whatever you're doing. I love that this was an excuse to get to know you. Tomer, thank you so much for being here.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:03):
It was great to be here. Thanks, Lenny.

# Why most public speaking advice is wrong—and how to finally overcome anxiety | Tristan de Montebello

## Transcript

Tristan de Montebello (00:00:00):
People tend to get into a public speaking voice. We'll be in a class and they'll be chatting normally and look super normal. And then we'll say, "Okay, now just a timer, I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline," and I click play, and suddenly I say, "The important part about doing this," and they enter into a different version of themselves, a professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversation. So the cue I often give people is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Today my guest is Tristan de Montebello. Tristan is the co-Creator of Ultraspeaking, which is the best public speaking workshop I have ever come across. In 2017, Tristan became the fastest competitor to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. And based on that experience, built a very unique course that helps you quickly build the skills to become better and to become more comfortable speaking in public, and especially speaking on the spot.

(00:01:04):
I'd like to spend time on this topic on this podcast because becoming a better speaker is such an accelerant of your professional life. And in this episode, we delve into a bunch of tactics and also misconceptions about how to become a better speaker, and to make it even more fun and interesting, we go through a few of the exercises that Tristan and his team have developed live on the podcast. He goes through them, I go through them, it was a lot of fun. I'm excited to hear what you think. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you, Tristan de Montebello.

(00:01:45):
Tristan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.

Tristan de Montebello (00:01:49):
Thanks so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:51):
So I took an abridged version of this speaking course that you teach called Ultraspeaking, and it immediately made me feel more comfortable public speaking, which I've never felt doing any other course. Public speaking is something it's just is very scary to me as it is for a lot of people, but it's just something I really dread. Even doing these podcast episodes, every time I get nervous before doing these things, as much as it may not seem that way. So this is not my natural habitat speaking, being in public. It may not seem that way to people, but it's true.

(00:02:22):
And the way you approach this stuff is so unique and worked for me. And because of that, I thought it'd be awesome to just bring you on this podcast and basically try to teach people the stuff that you've learned about how to become a better public speaker. I know we're not going to do your course here, but just, what are some very tactical things people can immediately start to apply? And also, I want to make the super interactive, so we're actually going to do some of the exercises that you use in your class. So that's what we're here for. How does that sound?

Tristan de Montebello (00:02:54):
That sounds exciting. I'm in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:56):
Great.

(00:02:59):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation, A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:03:52):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.

(00:04:18):
Today's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites, where you ask a question and it says something like, " Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product. The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions, providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful.

(00:05:11):
Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI. You can sign up at command.ai/lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/lenny.

(00:05:36):
Okay, so let me first ask just kind of a broad question. What do most people get wrong about public speaking? What are some of, what's maybe the biggest misconception about how to become a better public speaker and how to be good at it?

Tristan de Montebello (00:05:49):
I actually think that the biggest misconception with tackling your speaking is that people grossly underestimate just how transformative it could be to your life. And the reason it's so transformative is because speaking is not a specialized skill, it's a meta skill. That means that the better you get at speaking, the better your life gets.

(00:06:16):
So an example of a meta skill is fitness, for example. If you were to start saying, "Okay, I'm going to transform my fitness," and you start lifting weights and you start going on runs, obviously your muscles are going to get bigger, you're going to get more in shape, and your cardiovascular system is going to improve. But that's actually only a sliver of the impact it's going to have on your life because you're going to start feeling more energy, and you're going to start having these nice hormones, these endorphins flowing through your body and you're going to feel better about yourself. And when you walk in front of the mirror, suddenly you're going to have a boost in confidence. So naturally, everything else in your life is going to start to improve as a result of you focusing on your fitness. And for speaking, it's the same thing.

(00:07:01):
This blew my mind when I went on my own speaking journey, is when I started making breakthroughs in speaking, other things started to feel different. So as you get breakthroughs, how you feel at work feels different. How you feel in your group of friends feels different. How you feel in a group of strangers, especially, how you feel and your family can even be impacted. This seeps into everything else in your life. But the thing is, because there's so much self-consciousness that goes with speaking, we often feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety that come with speaking. So it can be hard to realize that underneath these layers, you actually have this extraordinary superpower, because as humans we're evolved to speak, this is what we are. So you don't need to teach a baby how to speak, it will learn by itself with no formal education. So what that means is, we all have this incredible hardware.

(00:08:12):
The thing is, over the course of our life, because of all these little situations that happen, we start getting bugs in the software and we're not really upgrading our software. The moment you get the bugs and things start working, not working, we start avoiding, and suddenly it's like we're not upgrading our software anymore. So we're stuck on old, buggy software. But the reality is, let's not forget that we have incredible software that were evolved for this. So all we need to do is some debugging and some upgrading of the software and suddenly your entire life can change. So that's really one I want to impart on anybody listening. You have it in, you already have what it takes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
Okay. So kind of building on what you just talked about, some of this insight of, your life can improve and how you kind of always have to unlearn stuff. One of my favorite maybe core insights and tenets of the way you approach teaching people to speak, is you talk about how if you don't enjoy speaking, you're doing it wrong. And that really helped me because you kind of encourage, you kind of remind people, try to have fun as you're doing. Can you just talk about that insight and why that's important and how that helps people become better?

Tristan de Montebello (00:09:26):
Well, I think that's very tied to what you were saying. I see enjoyment as a barometer, if I'm doing things right, I'm probably enjoying myself. If I'm doing things wrong, particularly with speaking, because again, this is something we're naturally evolved to do. So if we're naturally evolved to do it, it's not something that we dislike doing. It has to be something that rewards us. So as soon as things start not feeling enjoyable, it's a sign, hey, I'm probably doing this wrong, guy. There's something here that I'm doing that is making this unenjoyable that's probably not helping me.

(00:10:03):
And I think you mentioned that in those people who can hold an audience who are really good communicators in business, it looks like they feel very comfortable, it looks like they feel like themselves. And if you think about speaking, when you're talking with your kids, or with your partner, or with your best friend, your childhood friend, your parents, ever, we all have environments where we feel completely like ourselves. And when we do, communication is extraordinarily enjoyable. It's just a means to connect with other people, a means to share what we have on our mind and it's very, very empowering and it feels very good.

(00:10:42):
Then I take the same person with the same skill set and the same ability and I bring them in a business setting, and suddenly I don't feel like myself anymore. And because of the pressure, I start trying to speak differently. So people start having, I'm going to try to think really hard of what I need to say and I want to control the words that are going to come out of my mouth before they come out of my mouth so I make sure I don't make a mistake. And you basically loop in this thing that is so counter what communication is, which is just a natural subconscious scale. So using speaking as a barometer of, hey, if this is not feeling good, I'm probably overthinking. I probably need to relax and try to just feel a little bit more like myself.

(00:11:27):
But this also applies to practice, where in your practice, because this is not an overnight thing, you can't just snap your fingers, read a book, and be a better speaker. Well, your practice has to be enjoyable as well because otherwise two weeks in, you're going to quit just like a shitty fitness journey or diet. Right? You have to find joy in it and it has to be structured in a way where it rewards you as well, so that you get more energy and you get more enjoyment while you do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:58):
Awesome, and we're going to show people how you do that. You do these games, they're games that you play that help you actually learn these skills. So before that, and also I want to get into actual tactics that we can just give people to become better public speakers. But right before we get there, are there any other core insights or principles or lessons that are fundamental to the way you found that it works to become a better public speaker, that kind of inform a lot of the stuff we're going to be talking about?

Tristan de Montebello (00:12:25):
The day I understood that speaking was a subconscious flow-oriented process and not a conscious process, completely changed the way I approached it. So instead of thinking tactics and frameworks and adding more to the outside of the things I need to think about, when I realized when I speak best, I'm actually not thinking about speaking. It's the last thing I think about is the speaking part. I'm completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey to my audience or the person in front of me. And the goal is to get into a flow state and stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line. That's what really, really changed my mindset about speaking, because then it changes all of the exercise, the exercises you want to do. It changes how you can think about speaking.

(00:13:24):
And one of the ways that changed how I practiced was, instead of focusing on the symptoms of speaking, I started to try and figure out, well, what are the root causes that create these symptoms, and can I address those? So instead of counting my filler words, if that's something that's annoying to me, I'm going to go back and try to figure out, well, what's the root cause of that? Well, the root cause of having lots of filler words or racing in your speaking, is that you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or even pausing when your mind is racing and you feel pressure. Solve that, and not only do the filler words take care of themselves, but the racing takes care of itself and you suddenly have more mind space.

(00:14:11):
And if you feel super constrained in your speaking, very monotonous, then maybe you feel boxed in and you're struggling to allow yourself to feel to be all of what you are under pressure because there's probably a lack of certainty. A lack of trust in, hey, if I let myself be more intense or if I let some of these emotions pop out, or if I take a time to gather my thoughts, is everything going to unravel, or is that going to work for me? And if you haven't proven that to yourself, then you're just going to go for safety and so you're going to be very monotonous and constrained, and that's creates monotony. But if I can solve that, suddenly I have freedom. So thinking through this and understanding that the goal here is upgrading the software and it's really layering, taking all the bad habits away and putting in new habits that I can just stay in this flow state without getting pulled out, that really changes the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:15):
That is a really interesting insight, and I love that you actually demoed that in the way you answered this question, where you took time to get into that state and not just get, um... It's just like, pause.

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:28):
Pause.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
Yeah, that was a really beautiful example of that. Okay, let's get into a few tactics just to give people something they can-

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:29):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:34):
... actually change about the way they speak this week. What are two or three things that you can recommend people tweak in the way that they do public speaking, in the way they speak in meetings and presentations, whatever?

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:47):
I actually thought about this because once you think about speaking being much more about the root causes, like play the games that are going to change you at the root, don't focus on the symptoms, then you find yourself sharing much less purely tactical advice and frameworks because we're trying to get out of our brain into our subconscious.

(00:16:10):
So when I thought about it, I thought of three things I wanted to share. One makes you sound better or look better, one makes you sound better, and one makes you feel better. So the first makes you look better. Now this is super basic and very crunchy, but it's a bad habit that a lot of people have. That when I am trying to gather my thoughts or think, people tend to look down. And if you're looking down on Zoom, it's three times as bad because it looks like you're looking at your phone or looking at notes if you had any, but even when you're in person, it doesn't look very confident. And so you're suddenly giving off of that vibe of, oh, this person feels a little bit uncertain here, and maybe it's going to look like you stopped speaking and you might get more interrupted.

(00:16:56):
If instead you switch that up and you start thinking up. I think up into the right, but you can think in any direction you want, but as long as you're looking up, you actually look thoughtful by default. So suddenly you're looking thoughtful. That means you look more confident because anybody who'd be willing to pause in their speaking is somebody who's confident. And as a result, you're much less likely to get interrupted. So it's a small tweak but makes a real difference.

(00:17:24):
The only thing is if you're not used to doing this, if this is not your habit, then it's going to feel a little bit awkward the first time you do it and you probably won't think about doing it. So I recommend writing, think up, on a post-it and putting it on your computer so that it's there for you. And then once you've done it a few times, this will become the new normal and by default, you'll look more confident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
I'm going to do this as we talk. I have a poster right here. Think up.,

Tristan de Montebello (00:17:48):
Oh, nice. Think up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):
Okay, great. What else?

Tristan de Montebello (00:17:53):
Look more confident. Now how to sound more confident. This is a really important one, and this concept is called end strong. And it's, we had to bring this up because most people tend to end weak. And why is that? They put freestyle rappers in an fMRI, and what they found out is freestyle rappers have to enter a deep flow state. If you're freestyle rapping, you have a beat, you don't have any lyrics, and you have to get into the beat and invent the lyrics and the melody and everything on the fly. So there's no choice but being completely present. What happens is you can see their brain and it's lit up in a very specific place that shows that they're in flow, and when they get to the very end, the brain just blows up. Before they finish, they start getting pulled out of flow. And this is the same feeling of you're running at school and you see the finish line and just a few yards before you start slowing down. It's just, I don't know, we're built that way.

(00:18:53):
And in speaking, it's the same thing. People tend to give a great answer and then either they kind of taper off at the end, which doesn't leave you with a good impression, or they'll actively say the doubts that are coming up in their mind of maybe they'll be giving a great answer and then suddenly they say, "I don't really know if that makes sense."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
I do that all the time. That's very relatable.

Tristan de Montebello (00:19:13):
Yeah, but what the thing is, what happens when you do that? When you do that, it's like you're forcing this lens on your audience, where now even if they had the best of experiences with your answer, now they're looking at everything you said through the lens of, oh, this person was kind of uncertain. So it's like you had a very smooth flight across the Atlantic and your landing was absolutely horrible. You were bumpy when you were coming up, and then when you hit the landing, you bounced three times and you thought you were going to die. You're not going to remember the smooth flight, you're going to remember the ending. So a simple tactic here is, anticipate that as you get to the end of anything you're saying, you're going to naturally start regaining consciousness and you're going to start being a little bit more self-aware, and some of those uncertainties are going to pop up. Know that it's coming and make sure you land the plane.

(00:20:14):
So what that looks like is, either you just make your ending sound like an ending and then leave it at that, or you can prompt your brain. You can use summary prompts, this is incredibly powerful. It just means you say the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of, yeah, the beginning of a sentence, and your brain's going to fill in the gap. It's going to. You're prompting your brain and your brain will always deliver. So you get to the end, you're like, okay, I got to wrap up now. And so you'll say, "So to wrap up..." And your brain's going to fill in the gap. Or, "In summary, so my point here is, so what I want you to remember," and you just place those words and your brain's naturally going to do the work of closing it for you. But make sure you don't let go of the gas pedal at the very last moment, you need to land that plane.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
Awesome. I could definitely get better at this, great tip.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:04):
Yeah, thanks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:06):
I'm going to try to do that as we talk.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:07):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
And what else we got?

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:09):
I'll be paying attention to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
Okay, pressure.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:15):
Yeah. The third one is staying in character. And these go hand in hand. And what's really powerful is when you start doing these, there's a beautiful feedback loop that happens that gives you a lot of confidence. So staying in character I said is the one that's going to make you feel more confident.

(00:21:33):
What's staying in character? So it's related to end strong in some sense, in that people tend to self-sabotage a lot. I'm speaking, and obviously as I'm speaking, all of my senses are really, really heightened. So I'm aware of everything, if a word comes out a little bit weird or if it's not the word that I was expecting to hear come out of my mouth, I'm going to be very aware of that because I was expecting something and something different happens. But that happens all the time when speaking. I'm starting to not make as much sense or I feel like I'm rambling, going a little bit too long. All of these create insane noise in the back of my mind, the insecurities. And you have a choice there, because I can tell you right now, nobody can tell. People cannot see what you feel, even though it feels that way when you feel really, really strongly, but people can't see it. You're just looking like a normal speaker, competent and confident. But internally, it feels like everybody can see.

(00:22:34):
So you're feeling all this insecurity and it feels like there's an elephant in the room. And so what most people do is they start leaking and they break character. And they'll say, "Oh, man, I'm not making sense right now," or they'll laugh nervously after saying a word that came out weird, which is kind of saying like, "Oh, I also noticed that this word came out weird and it's okay." Right? Or they'll keep letting all of the insecurities and doubts come out when people didn't see it in the first place. So again, it's like I'm forcing these filters onto my audience and now they can only see me through that light.

(00:23:15):
And so one analogy I love for this is, again, a flying analogy. You're on the plane, everything's smooth, you're having a great time watching your movie, and suddenly you're interrupted by the pilot who picks up the intercom and says, "Oh, ladies and gentlemen, so I just had a red light start blinking here in the cockpit, and I'm not sure what this is. It could be really bad, honestly, but I don't know. So don't worry, please, I'll get back to you soon." First thing that's going to happen if you experience that is you're going to think, I wasn't worrying in the first place. But then you start thinking, wait, something probably is going wrong. And now the smallest noise, the tiny little bit of turbulence, a creak on the right, you're going to start thinking, oh no, we're going to die, every time.

(00:24:03):
So you're going to make any little mistake, any little imperfection, you're going to turn that into something big. That's what happens when you speak. If you start leaking and letting the insecurities come out, people are going to start thinking, this person doesn't really know what they're talking about. It's like a leader who isn't clear in their direction. Suddenly I'm thinking, wait, I think I have to second guess everything here because I'm not sure about this guy or this person.

(00:24:33):
And the good news is, the solution is very, very simple. The solution is that is just, don't share your insecurities. Put your best foot forward and stay in it the whole time. Stay in character from beginning all the way through past the ending, because you go all the way through your speech, then you got to end strong, which is a form of staying in character, and then let it be. And that's so important, just let it be and you're going to notice something incredible. If you're the type of person who would break character a lot, start staying in character, and the cue use for myself is, stay in it. And the worse it gets, the more I'll say, just stay in it. And what happens is, you stay in it.

(00:25:21):
And you expect everybody at the end to say, "Oh my God, you looked so uncomfortable, what was happening?" But people can't see that, that you look confident. So they're just going to give you the reaction that a confident person would get, and you're going to notice, oh wow, I am coming off as confident, and that's going to make you feel more confident. And so it's a very reinforcing cycle. If you start staying in character and ending strong, naturally, you're going to be reinforced by this behavior and you're going to realize, oh, I didn't need to break character. I didn't need to hedge every time I spoke, and that's going to give you much more confident, and you're going to start realizing, people just look confident by default. This is a crazy thing. I want everybody to walk around the world and look at people and think, most of the people I'm looking at are actually nervous right now. You're going to look at them and you're like, I can't tell. Most people speaking up in meetings are feeling a level of nervousness, but you can't tell unless it's through the roof.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):
I love this, and it's something I'm extremely guilty of. And I think the reason I do this and the reason I think a lot of people leak, which I love that term of just I don't leak, that you know, feel something's not going right. The reason I do it is I feel like me being upfront, I know this isn't great-

Tristan de Montebello (00:26:41):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):
... makes it okay, but in reality, that's hurting you because it's like when I watch standup comedy. When the comedian's like, "Oh, sorry, that bombed," if he didn't say that or she didn't say that, I'd just forget about it, and we'd move on to the next thing. And it brings all this attention to, oh, I see, okay, it's not going great. Otherwise, you're just like, all right, whatever, I didn't like that joke. And so, yeah, I guess any thoughts on just that, why people do this?

Tristan de Montebello (00:27:07):
Well, I think that's exactly that. It's because you're convinced that everybody can tell. And so two things will happen. Either they could tell because it was a big thing and everybody could tell, but you shining light on it is literally that. It's like, hey, everybody, you're driving a train, everybody's in the train, you're the driver as the speaker, everybody's going with you. So if there's a crash on the side of the road, you can keep going and they'll not be looking at the crash a second later and they'll be looking at the next landscape, or you can stop the train and tell everybody, "Hey, let's look at this crash here real quick. I'm so sorry about it." When you keep going, people will forget it in a second and they're not going to pay attention to you. And with the peak end rule, what we we're seeing, people remember the end of experiences more than they remember the beginning of experiences. So you're going to be left with that feeling at the end.

(00:27:58):
The other piece is, because most people won't notice it in the first place, they'll be in their own minds. So when you share this, you're popping their bubble. And so I see people speaking all the time where I'm super in tune with the feeling I'm getting when they're speaking. I'm listening to the energy, I'm listening to everything that's happening, so I can try to understand, what state are they in right now? So when I get woken up from that state of somebody saying, "Oh man, can I go again right now? That really sucked." It's even more visible for me.

(00:28:36):
And I'll often have to say, "Hey, man, I was so into what you were saying," and I'll poll the audience, "is anyone surprised?" And everybody every time is like, "No, I thought that you were doing great. I was completely with you." So that's the case most of the time, but because we're convinced that people can tell, we want to break that fourth wall or because something happened and we know people can tell, we want to acknowledge it so it doesn't feel like I'm the only one in the room who can't tell that something went wrong here. But this habit of saying, "No, I'm going to be confident, I'm leading, I'm going to keep us going in a certain direction," is extremely powerful and very self-reinforcing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):
Okay, so let's actually show people what this looks like by actually doing some live games. I know one of your principles for Ultraspeaking is you can't learn to speak by not speaking. You need to practice speaking to get better at speaking, and these games are a way to actually do that in a really fun way. So maybe first of all, just why games? When I did this course, I was just like, huh, because it's a bunch of games. I thought this was a public speaking course. So maybe talk about just why you approach it through games, everything you do is a game in this course.

Tristan de Montebello (00:29:48):
Yeah. Well, the first piece of the puzzle is what you were saying, that you can't get better at speaking without speaking. And it's, intuitively you could think, everybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read 100-

Tristan de Montebello (00:30:00):
Everybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read a hundred cookbooks. You actually have to spend most of your time in the kitchen refining your intuition, testing things, experimenting, learning new recipes, and building your timing and everything that goes with it. But in speaking, we tend to do the opposite, probably because it's a little bit scary and because there aren't that many options out there to practice the speaking itself. There aren't that many environments where you can do it right now. So we're kind of left with nothing, so, "Okay, I'll just go read an article or watch a YouTube short and hope that's going to make a difference."

(00:30:38):
But maybe the bad news is, you have to do it. You have to ask yourself, "Am I going to be serious about taking on speaking and making a difference here?" And if you are, then you're going to have to do the thing. You have to practice speaking. But the good news is, it's only the outside that's scary. As soon as you get started, you're going to get rewarded. And then, the better you get at it, the more enjoyable it becomes.

(00:31:03):
So why games then? Well, games number one, are fun to play. And as I was saying earlier, if your practice is not fun, you're going to stop. So you need intrinsic reward with what you're doing. But what all of the Ultraspeaking games have in common is that it's short, deliberate practice, short reps followed by feedback, followed by another rep. So that was more important than the idea that it was a game at first.

(00:31:35):
When we started coaching with Michael Gendler, my co-founder, it was just him and me in my backyard with somebody in front of us testing things out. And we would say, we would give him a speech title just to get a baseline. "Okay, what's the most incredible invention in the world?" And we'd watch this person go into their mind and start freaking out. And they'd think, " The iPhone," and then, "I don't know the iPhone. That's pretty recent. So maybe it's fire. Is it fire though? Was there a bigger maybe communication? I don't know. Wait. Maybe we've evolved for communication."

(00:32:08):
And the longer they spent thinking, the worse their answer tended to be, and the more their confidence tended to go down as they were speaking. So then we said, "Well, we've got to get this person speaking right away." So we'd say, "I'm going to ask you another question, but just start speaking." And so, I'd ask them another question and they couldn't start speaking right away.

(00:32:27):
So we just tried to compress it more and more and more to turn it into something where then it was like, "I'm just going to say a word and you have to say something about it, so horses." "Horseback riding is fun because you can go places." "Cats." "Cats are crazy because if they were bigger, they would eat you." And I just, almost like word association. Let's get words out.

(00:32:46):
Then we started developing different games for everything. Every root cause we were seeing, every symptom we were seeing, we'd figure out the root cause and we'd create some sort of a way to get the person into it as quickly as possible. And it's just one day, six months in that we realized, "Hey, did we just create a game? This feels like a board game." And then we created, I have this, we created Speak Before You Think, the game for people who think too much, and this is a bunch of cards with all of our games. And then, Covid hit and we turned it into online games.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):
Oh, I didn't know that.

Tristan de Montebello (00:33:23):
Yeah. The magic of games is short reps, immediate feedback, practice feedback, practice feedback. And it's enjoyable, you get rewarded, you get to adjust as you go. And what's changing is your internal feeling as you're going. So you're learning lessons, but you're internalizing. All of the practice is happening through speaking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):
To reinforce what you just shared, I haven't shared this with you, but after I took the course, the mini course, I went to see my family in L.A. We visited for a few days, and I was talking about this course and just how fun it was and interesting and how much I learned from it. And I pulled up the games because I have access to the things online. I was just like, "Hey, you guys want to try this?" and we started playing some of these games that we're about to get into. And it was just, we spent like an hour just doing this and everyone loved it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:15):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:15):
Everyone just felt so much better about their public speaking. Afterwards, my mom was like, "Hey, how do I do that on my own later?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:22):
Wow, that's cool.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:23):
My sister's like, "I want to start doing open mic nights because that was really fun just to talk."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):
Nice.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:28):
So were you actually coaching them? How were you walking them through the different games?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:34):
We just pulled them up and played them. And then, I shared some of the tips that I learned in the class that we took, just like, "Try it this way" or "Try not to focus on being correct. Just focus on confidence and not leaking that you're not doing great." All these things we're going to talk about. Yeah. So it was a lot of fun. So let's get into some of these games. So we're going to try two or three. Which one do you want to start with?

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:56):
Conductor maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
Sweet. I love Conductor. That one was really insightful to me.

Tristan de Montebello (00:35:00):
Okay, so I've got Conductor. The way this game works is that when I click "start training," I'm going to have a random title that's going to appear. And for those of you who are just listening and not watching this, Lenny will say the title out loud so you can hear. And then, what you won't see or what you'll see if you're watching is in front of me, all I'm going to see are a series of random numbers. It's going to start with five, and five is just my natural rate of speaking like I'm speaking right now. But then, I might see a number from one to 10, and each one of these numbers represents an intensity or a state that I have to tap into. So if I see a seven, I automatically have to raise my voice and get into that kind of an energy. And if I see a 10, you could only imagine what that is. But it's also true for the lower ones. If suddenly I see a three, I have to find a way to calm my energy and match the three and go all the way down to one.

(00:36:00):
And then, there might be a slide that says "breathe," which is just an indication to pause. And when I see that slide "breathe," if I just go silent, that's because I'm in front of the breathe slide and I'm not allowed to speak. And in that moment, my goal is just to relax myself and calm myself and then see what happens where I'm at when that slide moves on to the next one. And now we're going to do this. This is going to be 70 seconds, so it's going to be super quick. Ready?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):
Yeah. So I'll read the title as soon as it pops up.

Tristan de Montebello (00:36:31):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:33):
"When I grow up."

Tristan de Montebello (00:36:36):
When I grow up, I want to have taken on all of my weaknesses or all of the emotional things that are holding me back. Because kind of annoying for me that I'm 40 years old and there's still things that are holding me back that man, I've had these when I was a kid. I was like this when I was 10. And it drives me crazy, because aren't I supposed to be an adult? Aren't I supposed to be mature and have my life together? I have two kids. I have this incredible responsibility. And I have to teach them, I have to show them the way. So I've decided I'm going to hire a coach, and I talked to him just a couple of days ago, so this is perfect timing because I want to unwrap, unravel, and untwine every single one of these emotional blockers so that when I grow up, I'm completely free.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):
That was so fun to watch. I'm seeing the numbers. If you're on YouTube, you can see what's going on there. If you're not, basically there's different numbers that give Tristan the different energies to be at, and that was masterful.

Tristan de Montebello (00:37:56):
I think we saw, what did we see? We saw a six. It went up first, six, seven, then it went down to three. Then we saw, I think a two, a one, then a breathe, and then it went back to a five. How about you give it a go and then we chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):
Let's do it. What do you think?

Tristan de Montebello (00:38:11):
Ladies and gentlemen, let's see this. Here we go. The title is The Greatest Puzzle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):
The greatest puzzle that I think that I've had in my life, and I think just for most people, is trying to figure out what to do with their life. And I just had to spend so much time thinking... Actually, no, let me change. I'm changing direction. I actually have known from very early on what I wanted to do with my life. I've actually found it to be not much of a puzzle. I knew from pretty early that I wanted to be a software engineer. And interestingly, I became a software. And as I think about the puzzle that created around my life, I ended up... So my life actually started to look like a puzzle instead of what I'd always thought I'd be. So I ended up having a bunch of different careers. And I look back at my life and it started with one piece, and each piece led to all these other careers. Nailed it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:39:33):
It's funny. At the end you were like, you didn't even see there was a six that came up and then when you looked up, it had already gone away. That's a good warm-up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:42):
Yeah, yeah. Let's do it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:39:42):
It's funny, because what it looked like to me is that, well, you just didn't let yourself play the game. You wanted to... You were more focused on, "I want to make sure this works well, this looks good, or I don't make a fool of myself" than "Let me just play the game." So switch your mindset from that. Back in the Creator Cohort, you didn't really care, because if you failed, it didn't matter. So you just played the game. And this is the same idea. Just don't try. Just let yourself play the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:43):
Okay.

Tristan de Montebello (00:40:15):
The game will do good. But that was actually really interesting. I feel kind of similar, which is cool, except I didn't know where it was going. But that feeling of all of these puzzle pieces, and suddenly when I hit Ultraspeaking, it's like, "Oh wow, every single... There's no more. There are no more gaps." That's really cool. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):
Here we go.

Tristan de Montebello (00:40:36):
You ready?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:37):
Ready.

Tristan de Montebello (00:40:38):
Here we go. "Integrating new cultures."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:48):
It's interesting having a kid. So we just had a kid about a year ago, he is a year and a half. And there's an interesting new experience where there's my family and their culture, there's my wife and her culture. And it was never a big deal for us, these different backgrounds that we have because we could do our own thing, we have our families, they're doing their thing. But now that we have a kid, I have to really think about this. I have to constantly wonder, "Is he getting both experiences? Is he being pushed in one direction or another? Is he going to get the full benefits of both of these cultures?" And I find if I don't actually think about it too deeply and just let him have fun and hang out with our different family members, he gets everything that I want him to get; that he experiences my wife's family's culture, my family's culture, and then the combination of my wife and I's new kind of culture and family that we're building. And so, I'm really excited about the future for us all.

Tristan de Montebello (00:41:57):
Yeah, that was awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
I'm practicing not leaking. All I think about is how much better it could have been, but now I'm leaking as I say that. See?

Tristan de Montebello (00:42:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):
It's hard.

Tristan de Montebello (00:42:10):
Yeah. You're hedging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
Hedging.

Tristan de Montebello (00:42:13):
So the point of all of these games is to create turbulence. This is going to be the theme of this podcast. I'm going to share only flight analogies. But if you think about a pilot, a flight simulator, you can think about these games as the flight simulator. You don't put a pilot in a flight simulator and waste those precious hours having them just cruise at 30,000 feet in clear skies. You're going to say, "Okay, you're going and now hey, you've lost your captain and you have to do something" or "Hey, your motor just broke" or "You're going into crazy turbulence."

(00:42:46):
So the gain here is always, every one of these games have in common that we're creating turbulence for you. So it's on purpose that like, "Ooh, that's interesting how I tend to want to leak, to want to break character. Wow. It's interesting how at the end, the ending strong is not just an automatic habit that I've built for myself." So what we want with the turbulence is that it highlights areas that we want to work on. And you can go again and see immediately because you have that same pressure every time. There's no way you can prepare for Conductor. You can do just a ton of reps and get to become the person who can just navigate the turbulence really, really gracefully.

(00:43:29):
Which reminds me of a Kevin Kelly quote that I love where he says, "Pros are just amateurs who've learned to recover gracefully from their mistakes." And this is what we're trying to do here. If you know that you can recover from any mistake gracefully, then you're going to have confidence in any speaking scenario. And most of the scenarios you're going to be in are spontaneous, are ones you can't prepare for. So it's that much more important.

(00:43:57):
So tell me, what do you remember from going through Conductor and the Creator Cohort, or specifically here, what was coming up and what were some of the things that pop into your mind?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
There's two things that I really took away from it, and it's different doing it now on camera with this whole podcast thing.

Tristan de Montebello (00:44:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:16):
But the things that I really took away that have stuck with me from this exercise is one, is that you have this kind of metaphor of these file folders that you have kind of in your head where every energy level, like a one when you go low and a 10 or even a five, when you're at that energy level, you access different insights and memories and stories. So it's not just like, "Now I'm going to say the same thing at a 10, or I'm going to say the same thing at a one." It's when you let your body just slow down and relax to a one, new thoughts come up, because making it up as you go along and you're just trying to figure it out as you go. And that really happens when you're forced to go from five to, "Okay," and you let your body settle into a one. You're like, "Oh, okay, here's a new thought that comes to mind." So that was really powerful for me because I never had realized that.

(00:45:12):
And then, the other is just this idea of doing these really hard things with very low stakes. It's higher stakes, so maybe that's why it's different, how it feels different doing it here where it's like, "Oh, this is-"

Tristan de Montebello (00:45:22):
Yeah. Yeah, this is extremely high stakes for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):
Yeah, relatively. But yeah, there it's a couple people and you're like, just don't worry about failing so you don't even have to worry about apologizing or fleaking. It's just like, "Yeah, I did what I did." So those are two really powerful ones. I just like practicing this. And knowing you'll be okay at low stakes builds confidence. I'm like, "Okay." It's making up a minute of talk about the most random thing on the spot, not something that I would feel I'd want to do, but then you realize, "Okay, it's fine. I can do that."

Tristan de Montebello (00:45:54):
The common theme for me, and I've been on this journey for seven years now, I still am blown away every week by the lessons I've learned over the course of the seven years, which all come down to your brain, your subconscious is so incredibly powerful. So your hardware is magical. And because I've spent seven years kind of getting rid of the bad habits, getting rid of the gunk and trusting myself more, I allow myself to take many more risks. So I'm jumping into these games still with the same doubts in some sense, but they've just, everything's tapered down way, way, way into the background. So I get to be much more present.

(00:46:43):
And I talked about the summary prompts earlier in the podcast, saying the beginning of a sentence and trusting that your brain's going to fill in the gap is something that's initially hard to do. But when you've done it 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 times, you start believing, "Hey, maybe my brain will deliver every single time." So you can start saying the beginning of sentences the direction you want to go into and your brain fills in the gap, and we're going to do a game on that in a second.

(00:47:12):
But the Conductor one is so beautiful because the way we describe it, so that folder one when it came into my mind was my favorite ever. But the original one was when you tap into a certain energy, that creates emotion. And if you tap into that emotion, the words come as a natural consequence. So it's energy leads, emotions follow, and words fill in the gap.

(00:47:44):
And when you experience this for yourself, if you go into Conductor and you play, you realize, "Okay, if I want more conviction, I can raise my energy or get into a state of conviction and the words that are going to come out, the ideas, the stories, the anecdotes, the examples, everything is going to fit into that. If I feel frustrated, I can dive into that state and stay in that state, and naturally the content is going to follow. It's a very, very powerful game. It's a very exciting game, and it's a game that, especially when you're playing with low stakes, you very quickly feel the effect of, "Oh, I can see the potential of what it could be if I could just be like this anywhere." Maybe you taper out a little bit of the extremes.

(00:48:42):
But you can access this for free on Ultraspeaking or the way we did this at first, you just go to Google and type in a random series of nine numbers and then just have a friend say each number, one after the next, and you just match it. I used to just put my hand out and go up and down. So in essence, it's very, very simple to apply it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):
And it's just like a lot of fun to just get an excuse to just go wild and high and then just get low. I love that part of it. And let's get into the next theme. But just one other insight I had that you shared with me when I did it the first time is just people have a strength.

Tristan de Montebello (00:49:16):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
They're either, correct me if I'm wrong, they're strong at the highs and just very uncomfortable at the lows or the opposite. And for me, I thought I was going to, "Oh, obviously I'll be more natural at the lows, because like introvert world." And you're like, "No, you're actually super energized at this high end, and then it's hard for you to access the low." And I thought that was really insightful for me.

Tristan de Montebello (00:49:39):
Yeah. You'll notice it pretty quickly once you jump in, especially with a friend. It's cool because when you get to see, "Oh, I'm much more comfortable going up than I am going down or vice versa, or I'm stuck in the middle and I am only comfortable when I'm not in the extremes." It's just telling you something.

(00:49:59):
This is what we want. We want to a mirror in front of us so I can know, "Okay, what's happening here?" I'm not very much a fan of actually watching yourself on camera on video, because again, this is an inner game, not an outer game. So when I watch myself on video, I see the outside, which can be useful for certain things, but the fundamentals are inside. So getting a mirror of I play this game and I feel a certain way, "Oh, interesting. It was easy to go up." So I can muster energy pretty quickly, and I'm willing to take risks of jumping into a different energy stage, which might mean changing the direction of where I'm going.

(00:50:37):
But slowing down means I need to be willing to take up space. I need to be willing to just be while everybody's looking at me and I'm using up their time. But I'm going to take up space and I'm going to take a moment to go inside and be introspective and really ask myself, "Okay, what do I want to say here?" And so, that's a reflection of, "Well, what does that mean if I struggle to do that?" And that's why speaking such an interesting skill set.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):
All right, let's do another game.

Tristan de Montebello (00:51:10):
This next game is called Triple Step. And Triple step is a game for people who struggle to stay on a single thought or get very easily put off their game or distracted. If you're the type of person where you're speaking and suddenly somebody yawns and you just start freaking out thinking, "I'm so boring and things are horrible, I must be terrible." Not, they probably have a baby and they didn't sleep last night. A pen drops and you start losing your ability to stay on track, this is a game for you. Also, a very fun one.

(00:51:46):
The principle of the game is pretty simple. Similarly to Conductor, we're going to start with a random speech title. So I have no idea what's going to show up. Then as I'm speaking, in this setting here, I'm going to speak for a minute. There will six random words or series of words that are going to pop up as I'm going through my speech. And my goal is to integrate the words into the speech as seamlessly as I can, as if they were part of the speech the whole time. So in theory, if I do a perfect job, if you're listening, you should struggle to pick out which words were actually the words that were popped up. The likelihood in one minute of me being able to do that is low, but let's see if you can do it. So if you're listening, you're not going to see the words. We'll tell you afterwards what they were. See if you can pick up on them. But otherwise, my goal is just to choose a strong direction and stay on that direction as naturally as I can.

(00:52:43):
Here we go. The title is, How Would Your Friends Describe You? I've been described as a Labrador by my friends. And I think the reason people describe me as a Labrador is because I am so easy to excite. It's like if you give me a box of french fries, I'm going to go nuts and it's going to be the best french fries I've ever tasted in my life. But if the next day I get a massage, I'll be completely in that experience and the massage is going to be the best massage. And then, I'm going to think, "I need to get a massage every day." I'm going to start daydreaming about massage as my natural day to day.

(00:53:19):
But the problem with being a Labrador is that Labradors get kind of excited. So I may be doing cartwheels one second, and the next second I'm supposed to be working. And so, I'll be on my computer, but then I hear the microwave ding and I think, "Oh, maybe I should go get some food next." And so, there's a beautiful trait to being the Labrador that allows me to explore all of what it's like to be human. I always have access to the internet inside me, but there are definitely some drawbacks as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:50):
Okay. So the words that you had to integrate are french fries, getting a massage, daydreaming, cartwheels, a microwave, and the internet.

Tristan de Montebello (00:54:05):
Yeah. And so, you might notice that some of the words I'm integrating literally, and some I might integrate more metaphorically like the internet of my mind. It's like I have access to the internet. So you can give yourself as much leeway as possible. The whole point here with Triple Step is you want to be that tree in the storm that is not so rigid that if the wind is too strong it's going to break in half, but not so flexible that it's going to swing every which direction as soon as there's a gust. So you want that firm solid grounding, which is in choosing a clear direction, that one thing off the bat, and then you want to make the words work for you. So stay focused on that one thing. And as the words come in, the more focused you are on that groove you've created for yourself, the easier it will be to let the words work for you. Okay?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:03):
And again, the skill this builds is to be more comfortable with things not going perfectly and being distracted.

Tristan de Montebello (00:55:12):
Yeah. I would say this one can be used for two other things. Number one is resiliency, right? Because this one will make your brain go crazy. And if you can stay composed within it, with all of these things happening, it really builds this ability to say, "Well, man, if I can do Triple Step on hard mode, I can do anything. Why would anything else scary? Why would an interview question scare me when I can throw these kinds of things? I can always navigate my way through." Right? We're trying to lower the likelihood of a mistake really hurting you.

(00:55:48):
And then, the other piece is this is a game, this one and a game called Rapid Fire Analogies, are games that are really, really nice to use as a way to warm your brain up. So you could use it before a podcast. You could use it before a job interview, before a meeting. When you want to be on, do a few reps of this, and your brain's just going to be completely lit up because it's pulling on so many different parts of your brain that are necessary for communication.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
One last thought just before we dive into it. I think it's just to zoom out again, the reason that you've found this is a better way to learn to become better at public speaking, my sense is just if you were to just do the standard thing of just give more talks, find more opportunities to do presentations, it's too broad of a brush to build these different skills, and which you've identified is there's these very specific skills that add up to a great presenter. And these games pick a specific skill and help you just focus on that again and again and again.

Tristan de Montebello (00:56:51):
If you're already practicing, you're already leagues ahead of everyone, because most people aren't practicing. They're you're trying to learn from a video or a YouTube short or an article. You can only go so far with that. But if you are practicing, there are kind of two suboptimal ways that might show up. One is what you're saying. You're doing talks and you're speaking up more, but you're not really practicing. It's kind of, as you were saying, it's broad, broad strokes.

(00:57:17):
The other one is you are in a choreography, so it's like learning how to dance, but you only learn choreography. Well, that's all you know how to do. So if I ask you to do, I say, "Okay, now I'm going to put music on. Just dance." You're kind of stuck because you only know how to do the moves you were doing. So we're trying to get people outside of, "I have to be in my mind, or I have to do things that I've memorized how to do" and come back to trusting your natural ability to communicate.

(00:57:51):
So that's what we're doing here. You can feel like when you don't speak, when you struggle with speaking, you're stuck in this box, and everything around you is tiny and you can feel the sides of the box. And we're expanding the range. We're playing around with all kinds of different things, different tools. And all of them have specific meaning, but even if they didn't that much, you still would be able to, "Oh wow," you're pushing back the sides of the box. And now suddenly, "Hey, I can move around. I feel comfortable moving my arms and moving my legs and going to the right and the left and up and down." And just that act of making you feel more comfortable and more at ease is going to unlock your ability to communicate, because you already know how to do a lot of this. So we're tapping into these different skill sets and we're doing both at the same time.

(00:59:40):
All right, let's do this. I'm energized. I'm pumped.

Tristan de Montebello (00:59:43):
Let's do this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:44):
No, I'm not going to... I was going to say I'm going to nail it, but no, let's just have fun. Let's have fun.

Tristan de Montebello (00:59:49):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:50):
It goes how it goes.

Tristan de Montebello (00:59:52):
Indeed. Here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):
Okay. And I'll say the title. The best thing about pain. So this is something I recently shared in another talk is just this quote that I always think of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:01):
In another talk is just this quote that I always think of, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek," that the thing that is hardest often points you in the direction you want to go. Like I hate blue cheese, but sometimes I find that if I eat the blue cheese and add it to a salad, it ends up being the best salad I've had. Having kids is another amazing example where just kids are... There's so much pain, but it's also, there's nothing that is more joyous than having a kid.

(01:00:29):
And sometimes even growing a beard. I grow this beard and I have to maintain this beard for the rest of my life. And I know people would look at me without a beard and be like, "What the hell? Well, you look so different now and so young." Sometimes I think about just having a sibling and the pain that if I had a brother, if he just hit me, the pain that would come from that, but just then having the brother would be so much worth it, even if he's hitting me all this time.

(01:00:58):
And there, I ran out of time, but that was solid.

Tristan de Montebello (01:01:04):
Okay, I realize this is your first time playing Triple Step. It's kind of mean of me if you [inaudible 01:01:09]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:09):
I have to go faster.

Tristan de Montebello (01:01:10):
... Give you six words. So I'm going to give you four words.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:12):
Okay. Okay.

Tristan de Montebello (01:01:13):
But here's what I noticed. What I noticed is you were letting the word... The word was the beginning of a new thought. Right, so you say, "Another thing is beers. Another thing is...". So you're finishing your thought and then you're moving on to the next one. Try to hold onto one direction. The one direction is approach your fears head on. And then, so when you see a puzzle, it's like, look, this doesn't have to be a hard puzzle because now I know that if it's scary, I do it. And it's like having kids, which I thought was so scary, I just jumped in and now I'm moving forward. And so it's like I'm growing my beard without caring what other people think just because it might be scary, or maybe I cut my beard because that would be something scary. So you're holding onto the line.

(01:02:08):
With four, it's going to be a little bit easier to integrate them. Ready?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Let's do it.

Tristan de Montebello (01:02:18):
Social-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):
Social distancing. It's interesting that social distancing was such a thing that we all had to do for so long. And then all of a sudden we look back at that time we're like, "Was that actually necessary? Did we actually have to stay far from each other? Did that actually have any impact?".

(01:02:34):
There's all these things we have to learn, like sometimes we look at the stock market and we wonder, "Should I be paying attention to the stock market? Should I be distancing myself from it? Should I be investing more often? Should I be reading every newspaper that comes out every day to stay on top of what's happening in the world? Should I get closer to this information or should I distance myself? What's better for me?". And sometimes it feels like you're running this marathon where sometimes you go back and forth. Sometimes it's, "Let's all be together. Let's pay attention to all the news. Let's hang out." And it kind of feels like I just want to just want to go to the toilet and peace out.

Tristan de Montebello (01:03:24):
Amazing. That works. That's really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):
Okay.

Tristan de Montebello (01:03:27):
That's really good. Well, tell me what, because again, the games are meant to put you in a state of turbulence and find out what was easy, what was hard, what am I noticing? And now you know what you want to work on. If you did a rep and you got it and it went perfectly, then you're learning nothing. A really easy rep is not worth much. The only reps that are worth something are the ones where you feel an edge.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:57):
Yeah. And by the way, we should say the words right, that I had.

Tristan de Montebello (01:04:00):
Oh, yeah. The first one was the stock market, then a newspaper, which you brought in really, really well, then running a marathon, and then toilet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, just the fact that I'm okay doing this is a big milestone for me of just like, ah, whatever. Because before doing this thing I'm like, oh my God, I never want to sit there and come up with a talk for a minute on the most random subject, and there's a lot of power in just feeling comfortable just doing it, just like, sure, let's do it. Whatever. Something will come out that's interesting enough.

Tristan de Montebello (01:04:35):
That's why taking on this journey of speaking is so empowering because speaking is a high performance skill. So taking on a high performance skill, and starting to tackle it, and getting kind of good at it is very addictive. It feels really, really good. If you get good at tennis, if you get good at golf, if you get good at anything, product management, it's a addicting, it's exciting. And as soon as you get good, there's nuance to it, and it's energizing in and of itself. And because we have such awesome hardware as humans, we've been speaking all of our life, a lot of us have a pretty decent level to start out with. So you really quickly, you're getting to like, "Oh, I'm getting some results here. This actually feels good." So there's something really energizing about jumping into it. It's the thinking about doing the exercise that's scary, but as soon as you're in it, it's energizing and empowering.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:35):
And also just doing it, this is a very hard exercise. Just giving a made up talk for a minute with words you have to integrate, and concepts. And I think just doing that makes a regular talk so much easier also, because you don't have to do that. So there's something there about just doing it on hard mode, learning things, and then, oh, okay, I just have to talk about a thing that I already know about, that I have planned, much easier. Anything else around this game that is worth sharing before we do our final game?

Tristan de Montebello (01:06:06):
We have a whole series of games, and you could probably even invent other games, but some people will play Triple Step and will say, "Wow, that's so hard." And then they'll go and play Conductor and think, "Wow, this is my game. This is so easy." But other people will play Conductor and think it's impossible, and then come play Triple Step and they'll be like, "Man, this is my jam. I can get this one very, very easy."

(01:06:31):
So again, it's just a mirror of where you're at. And what's beautiful about this is you start playing around with these games, you're very, very quickly going to see, okay, this is my edge. And where your edge is, as you were saying with your quote, is often where the gold lies. So if you can spend some time there and learn what it is underneath the struggle, what's actually holding you back. When you unlock that, whatever's holding you back in Triple Step, or in Conductor, in any other game, is holding you back elsewhere in your life. So when you unlock it there, it kind of unlocks the other things, which is really nice, like a set of gears.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
And it's interesting, as we were talking, where my mind keeps going is I just want to say how I didn't feel good about my performance, but I'm internalizing the lesson of don't leak how you feel. And that's a really powerful lesson. It's really hard not to just to be like, "Oh, that was not good." I really wanted to say that after every time I tried this and I am making myself not. And I imagine from your perspective you're like, "No, it's fine. It's like whatever."

Tristan de Montebello (01:07:40):
Yeah, absolutely. I was actually thinking, I bet a lot of people watching you do that would think, wow, I don't think I could do that. That would be their first thought.

(01:07:49):
So absolutely. And again, and this is a habit. And the noise doesn't completely disappear, but it goes down to being almost imperceptible. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to internalize all of these habits to the point where I don't need to consciously think about them.

(01:08:12):
So it's like a gymnast who's doing their tumbling routine and jumps into the air. As they're flipping, they're not consciously trying to think of how to do a flip. They've done it a thousand times. They know how to do a flip. The only thing they have that they may be thinking of, all of their attention is on being completely present to what's happening, relying on your body and your subconscious knowing what to do, is they have kind of like listeners, like in programming, keyboard listeners. You have something that's there that is just listening for anything out of the ordinary. And it's very, very fine-tuned.

(01:08:47):
So as I'm speaking, for example, I might think to myself, "Oh, I may be rambling right now. Maybe I'm going a little bit too long." And it's a little listener that's going to just gently, nicely, say, "Hey, warning, I don't know if you're aware of this." And as I hear that, I might say, "Oh, okay, let me wrap it up." Or maybe it's saying, "I'm not sure if you're being clear," or, "Can you be more precise here?". Whatever it is, it's just a gentle listener in the background.

(01:09:15):
So as you get into the habit of staying in character, and if you had an audience here, we could have asked them right away, "Well, how do you feel about this?". You probably would've gotten really good feedback, really positive, which would've kind of jarred that feeling of, wow, I didn't think I did it that good of a job. And people are saying, "Hey, I thought that was pretty good." So As you get that reinforcing pattern, the voice starts going down more and more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:43):
Awesome. I need that voice to go down. That'd be great.

Tristan de Montebello (01:09:46):
[inaudible 01:09:46].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:46):
Okay, let's do another game.

Tristan de Montebello (01:09:48):
Always does.

(01:09:49):
Cool. Let's do last game. Last one of these practical games. So this is actually a game from one of our courses that I'm pulling out. It's not a standalone game, it's one that's inside of the courses. But again, if you wanted to replicate this yourself, you can very easily do it.

(01:10:09):
So what we're going to do here is we're going to work on conviction prompts. So this comes back to this idea of entering a state or changing your energy to impact the words that are coming out of your mouth. So what's going to happen here, is similarly to Triple Step, I'm also going to get a random topic that I just have to start speaking about. But now, instead of getting a word that I have to integrate into my speech naturally, I'm going to get a prompt. So it's going to be the beginning of a sentence that I have to say out loud, and I have to find a way for my brain to just complete the sentence. And the sentences are specifically chosen because they're going to put you in a state of more conviction. So it's going to force me to care more about what I'm saying basically.

(01:10:56):
And this is a game for executive presence. If you think about somebody who you feel has great gravitas or great executive presence, they usually have, there's something about them that's saying, this person really believes in what they're saying. And what this game is showing you is that, hey, there's a way to fast track myself to that place. If I want to have more executive presence, let me bring a little bit more conviction to what I'm saying.

(01:11:27):
There's a caveat, small caveat. Maybe 10% of people in the workforce need the opposite. They need, "Hey, you need to maybe question what you're saying here." But the reality is the vast majority of people actually are not truly standing behind their words and their ideas. And what that does is that the people who speak a lot and feel a lot of conviction, their ideas go through more often than the others. And you'd want ideas to stand for themselves, but that's just not reality. So for most people listening to this, if you can bring more conviction to your words, then your ideas are going to have a better chance of being seen equally to those who are already doing that. So this is what this game's about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):
Awesome. Okay.

Tristan de Montebello (01:12:15):
Okay, here we go. The title is Saying No. I've had to learn this the hard way as an entrepreneur, that saying no is one of the most important things I can do. But saying no is not saying no to a meeting, because that can be easy. And what I'm going to say now matters a ton. This is saying no to doing all of the exciting projects that I want to do. So as I said earlier, I'm Labrador. I get excited about everything, and I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome, but that doesn't mean I can do every idea. I need to choose a very clear focus and stick to that focus.

(01:13:02):
And this is a game changer. When you start reducing the amount of things you're doing to a painful amount, a painful few amount, then when you get there, suddenly everything else changed. And it astonishes me when I do that, just how much more I can get done, even though I'm doing fewer things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:22):
I love it. That was great. These words are tough.

Tristan de Montebello (01:13:27):
They were, yeah. This was not an easy one. This was not a... Good thing that I get a tough one. Well deserved.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:35):
Let me read the phrases real quick, just so folks know. So the phrases you had to integrate is, "This matters a ton. I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome. Game changer."

Tristan de Montebello (01:13:45):
It was just, "I genuinely believe that." Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
Oh, got it. Okay. "I generally believe that." And then, "game changer". And then, "It astonishes me when."

Tristan de Montebello (01:13:55):
And I'm so eager for you to go through this, and for anybody listening to try this for themselves, even if you know what's coming. Like, if you want to do this for yourself right now, write the words, the prompts that Lenny just shared, and choose any title, and just speak for a minute, and see if you can integrate those in. Because you're going to notice how if you bring conviction, these words naturally bring that out of you. And it's so interesting to watch the content change as a result of the state you get into and what you say. So it's really powerful to discover just how incredible your brain is.

(01:14:36):
So same intention for you I think, is choose a strong direction from the beginning. This is always, in speaking in general, the stronger the direction you choose in the beginning, the more ideas you're going to have. Everything gets easier when you choose a strong direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:54):
Okay, let's try it.

Tristan de Montebello (01:14:55):
But the goal here, is as it says, advocate for an important idea related to the speech title. Ready?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Tristan de Montebello (01:15:02):
Here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:02):
YOLO.

Tristan de Montebello (01:15:06):
The title is Space Exploration.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:08):
I think it's hard to imagine anything more important to the human race than space exploration. I know there's a lot of talk about people wasting time trying to get us to Mars, or trying to not think about what is happening on earth, but I feel like there's nothing more powerful, and important, and inspiring. In fact, the entire world needs to focus more on the value of space exploration. There's so many things we can discover, so many things that can help us on earth, and we cannot forget how much potential exists outside of our little earth, that we think our whole existence and everything that's ever existed on this one planet, when really we're this tiny, pale blue dot. And it just astonishes me when people don't think about this, don't think it matters, don't think they should spend any time getting us into space, investing money in space. And just hearing stories, if nothing else, of people that have gone into space and how life-changing that was for them, should tell us that space exploration is incredibly powerful and important.

Tristan de Montebello (01:16:14):
Yes, that was awesome. That was so cool. So you had, the title was Space Exploration, and the words were, "in fact", "the entire world", then, "We cannot forget that," then, "It astonishes me when," and finally "life changing". So what was that like? What did it feel like getting...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Yeah, there's a lot of... It really helps, just like, "Here's the thing you're going to believe." And I don't know if I got lucky with stuff, but it just felt like, okay, I have, something comes up that I'm not going to leak. But anyway, it was like, oh yeah, cool, something interesting happens.

(01:16:57):
And that's one of my other actual, just going on a little quick tangent, insights from the lessons that you guys teach, is that as you are forced to talk, you have new insights emerge. And you almost figure out what you think and know by being forced to get out of your head, and these problems help you along that. But I think that's really interesting, of just like, this will help you develop things, and insights, and take them out of your head.

Tristan de Montebello (01:17:26):
Yeah. Well, hopefully we get to talk about the Accordion Method, one of the most powerful methods I have, which is very close to this.

(01:17:35):
But this is often a prompt I tell people when they're speaking. I say, because people tend to get into a public speaking voice, so we'll be in a class, and they'll be chatting normally, and look super normal. And then we'll say, "Okay, now just a timer. I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline." And I click play, and suddenly I say, "The important part about doing this," and they enter into a different version of themselves, a very professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversationally.

(01:18:18):
And so the cue I often give people is don't think about us, just think out loud. And that's really what we're doing. We can, most people have a skill set that's up here and a mindset that's down here. And so if you can just change the mindset to match the skill set, you've already made a giant leap. And you do that by reducing the stakes in your mind and by just speaking. And as you do that, when you're thinking out loud, you have these moments of connecting things in your mind, and then naturally it pops out.

(01:18:59):
And if you're doing it well... And I love, there's a really cool Naval Ravikant interview on the Joe Rogan Podcast from many years ago that's phenomenal. And at one point he talks about communication, if I'm not mistaken. I think it's on that podcast. But he says something along the lines of, "One should discover the words they are saying at the same time their audience is." And this comes back to thinking out loud, like if I'm really in my mind, I'm making connections, and suddenly the words are the consequence of it.

(01:19:31):
So using prompts, poking your brain, giving these cues naturally creates things that you couldn't have anticipated otherwise. It's like putting constraints on a creative project.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:46):
I love that. Before we segue to a couple of these methods, the Accordion Method is one example, I want to ask about, when people hear this, they may feel like you're helping people more, just like make shit up, and why, why would we want that? Talk about just how this isn't just like, you're not going to actually give talks like this necessarily. This is... And I guess I'm answering the question, but I'm curious if that's how you think about it. This is building a skill so that when you actually want to give a real talk that you've prepared, you are better at it. But yeah, just thoughts on just that potential element.

Tristan de Montebello (01:20:23):
Yeah, I think that's an important question, and it's a question I hear a lot because we all know a bullshitter, and that's the person who masters the skill of communication but doesn't have anything to show for it.

(01:20:43):
And so this thing happens, is that I see bullshitter and I think to myself, I really, really don't want to become that person. And what happens is it becomes an immune response or like an immune response where the desire not to be that person and the feeling being around that person gives you is so strong that now if I take even the smallest step in that direction of speaking freely, sharing my thoughts out loud, bringing more conviction or confidence to what I'm saying, not leaking, then there's this immediate response like an immune response in my body that's just too strong, that's saying, "Uh oh, you're becoming the bullshitter. Alarm bells. Alarm bells. Go back to that safe little corner you were in."

(01:21:39):
But the reality is, if you're thinking that, then you have no chance of becoming a bullshitter. Because if that thought is even popping into your mind, then you're the type of person who has developed a very acute skill set of noticing when people bullshit. And you have that same skill set for yourself. So it's just going to be, now it's just too loud.

(01:22:05):
So as we go through this practice, we want to match, "Hey, I want to match that bullshitter's level of communication, except I'm going to have the ideas to back it up. I'm going to really put effort into my craft, but I'm going to be able to show them in the best possible light." And what we want to be able to do is notice, okay, if this is a big thing for you, the bullshitting, and you're noticing a big reaction, just even listening to us, not even playing the games yourself, then you definitely benefit from calming that voice down. So spending time learning these skill sets, because you're most likely atrophied because you're staying away from it. And you're going to have this very powerful listener in the back of your mind that's going to ping you, and it's like, "Hey, you're at the limit right now. Stay true to what you know." And it's going to be a very good compass for yourself. It's going to be there and you can trust it because you developed this capacity.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:02):
Awesome. That's really helpful.

(01:23:05):
Okay. So, so far we've shared a bunch of techniques, things that you could just start doing today. We've done all these fun games that you could play online. If nothing else, just learning from the techniques these games teach you I think is really helpful. You've shared a bunch of principles of just like, here's how you actually get better at public speaking, and not this way, but that way.

(01:23:27):
I know you have a couple also methods just like that people can implement that helps them develop talks that I found really helpful. So maybe just as a closing, we talk about these two methods, the Accordion Method, and I think it's the Bow and Arrow Method?

Tristan de Montebello (01:23:40):
Uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:41):
Awesome. Let's talk about the Accordion Method. We did this in the class briefly, and it was really helpful, and I've been explaining it to people of just like a really cool way of making your talk better. So talk about how that works and how people might be able to implement it when they're trying to develop the talk.

Tristan de Montebello (01:23:55):
Now, I'm biased when I'm going to say this, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I think the Accordion Method, the Accordion Method might be one of the things I'm the most proud of in my entire life because it's almost revolutionizing the way I think we should prepare speaking.

(01:24:19):
So up until now, we've talked about spontaneous speaking mostly, and that's going to be the vast majority of your speaking. Probably 80% of your speaking is stuff that you can't prepare for. But there are going to be situations where you know you have a deadline and you're going to have to speak. And either you have to speak because it's a job interview, or you're talking to your CEO, or maybe you're presenting to your whole team or an audience of a thousand.

(01:24:45):
The old way I think is shitty. I think it's broken, and I haven't found anything out there that is innovating on this. And it drove us crazy with Michael, and that's what gave birth to the Accordion Method. What's the old way? The old way is I have a talk coming up, so I'm going to dump all of my ideas on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper. Then I'm going to try rearranging those ideas. And as I'm rearranging the ideas and trying to make them in a talk, I have more inspiration. And I'm thinking, oh, maybe I could say it this way, and I don't want to lose that other thing that I said in the beginning because maybe I would use it.

(01:25:22):
And you start just creating this alien stack of paper with all of your ideas of what your talk might be, and then you're left with 10, 15 pieces of paper. And now as the deadline comes closer, what do you have to do? Well, you have to go through the excruciating pain of turning 10 pages into a script so that you don't forget all of those brilliant lines that you spent so many hours editing. And they're still in writing mode. They're not in your mind.

(01:25:50):
So now that I've created that script that I spent a lot of time editing, now I have to memorize it. And memorization is pretty. We're not good at memorization. Robots are good at memorization, humans are not. And memorization is like a chain where you just have all of these links very linearly. And everybody knows the feeling of going through, reciting a poem as a kid, and suddenly you miss one verse and you're lost, and now you're a deer in the headlights.

(01:26:21):
So what we're doing with the Accordion Method is instead of preparing our talk by writing, we're going to prepare our talk by speaking, and we're going to do so in a very specific way where we're going down the accordion to create extreme clarity, and to understand what the essence of our talk is, and then back up the accordion to bring back in intentionally just the right pieces.

(01:26:48):
So I was thinking of an analogy for this, and one that I really like is imagine you're redecorating your living room. The old way, the writing 10 pages and memorizing it is I'm going to look at my living room and I'm going to rearrange things and put stuff in a corner that I might need later. And then I'm going to bring some new things that I thought could be really nice and I'm going to struggle to make something work.

(01:27:14):
The Accordion Method is saying, and imagine this were easy to do with furniture, I'm going to take everything out of my living room except the most essential pieces that make my living room. So I might be left with that one couch that I really love, a pillow, a beautiful light that I bought three years ago, and one or two other small things. And as I look at that, I'm going to have clarity on the vision I want for my living room. And then very slowly, very intentionally, I'm going to go take certain elements that were already there that I might want to bring back in, and I'm going to bring new elements that now I see make sense. And so by the time you finish with your beautiful living room, it's going to be this beautiful minimalistic room that has a very clear design choice, and every element there is there because you chose it. It's there because you did it very intentionally.

(01:28:15):
So how does that work with the Accordion Method? What we do is you can go through the first step. If you want, you can write all of those ideas on paper just to get them out of your head. That's totally fine. But from this moment on, there's no more script. And I'm just going to give an example of times, but you can change these time constraints slightly. We're going down the accordion by using time constraints. So for example, you would say, "I'm going to speak for three minutes." So you're going to put a timer, and you have two rules. I have to stay in character the whole time and I have to end strong. So you must make it to the end of the three minutes, and it doesn't matter how bad it sounds, how many mistakes you make. The only point here is I'm trying to get my ideas out into spoken word. So I'm starting to populate my mind with everything and seeing where am I actually at.

(01:29:13):
Then after the three minutes, you think of, okay, what did I like, what didn't I like? Then you go to two minutes. And you put a timer and you do two minutes again. And you're very strict with those two minutes, because we're just trying to learn something every time. It doesn't need to be perfect. So at the two-minute mark, you do the same thing, but now you had to shave a whole minute out of that content. And as you do that, well, that means getting rid of the noise, getting rid of anything that doesn't feel right.

(01:29:38):
Then you go down to one minute. And you're going to go down all way to 30 seconds. So you started at a three-minute speech and you make your way down to 30 seconds. By the time you make it to 30 seconds, you're going to have only the essential pieces like that couch and that lamp in the living room. When you have the essential pieces, you're going to have a clear sense of what your talk is about, and it might've changed as you-

Tristan de Montebello (01:30:00):
Sense of what your talk is about and it might've changed as you were going down the accordion. And then from that place on, we're going to do another 30 second rep and then we're going to go back up the accordion. So you do another 30 seconds and then you do one minute, two minute, and all the way back up to three minute. And every step of the way you go from 30 seconds to a minute. Initially, a minute felt hard. Now that's double the time you just had. So you can bring in something that's aligned with the talk you want to share, and then two minutes, same. And then when you get to three minutes, one of my clients once said that it felt like he had a football field in his mind. So much space. And now whatever talk you have left there is a very clear, intentional talk.

(01:30:45):
And not only that, and this is why this is such an incredible method, your talk is now internalized. So you're at the stage of I've written a script that I've painfully edited in the old way that you now still have to memorize and it's a written speech that you're going to have to pretend to give in a spoken way. In this case you're there, but it's already completely internalized, not even memorized. It's internalized. You have these pillars, you know where you're going and by the time you make it through the accordion method, you're basically ready to go give it on stage.

(01:31:22):
But you could give it now in one minutes, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes. It's very plastic. You're going to be able to navigate different time frames. It's not going to really matter if you make a mistake because you're going to have a deep sense of what your speech is. It's not memorized, it's internalized. So not only have you gotten clarity and built out your speech in a very intentional way, but by the time you get to the end of it, you also actually know it and you're ready to perform it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:51):
That example of the three minute when you come back up the accordion, that's exactly how it felt when I did this is just like, "Wow, so much time now" because you essentially, the way I think about it is you concentrate it to the best, most important nuggets and then you have time to build on those nuggets and you cut out all the stuff that no one really cares about, which is usually a long introduction, just like now just get to the good stuff and then you expand the good stuff. And it really worked for me and it was a really illuminating experience.

(01:32:19):
For someone that wants to actually use this. Say they have a speech coming up, say they're doing an all hands presentation in a week. Do you do this a week ahead of time? Do you do this a few days before? I guess where do you fit this in the workflow so that you actually remember what you want to say when it comes time?

Tristan de Montebello (01:32:36):
I can't say do it exactly a week or two weeks or it really depends how well familiar you are with the content. If you have an all hands, and this is something that you've been hashing with your executive team over the past two months, you probably know it really, really well and you have a lot of clarity and now it's just about organizing it nicely. So in that case, maybe you want to do a rough go through the accordion a week ahead of time so you have a clear sense of, "What is it that I want my audience to remember and what are the pillars that I know I like to hit that feel really good?"

(01:33:15):
So you can think about these as the foundational pillars that support that one thing that you're sharing or bookmarks that I know I have to hit and then what I would like to do. And so that's what I would write down. I wouldn't write a script. I'd write those down. And then before the all hands, maybe the day before, maybe even the morning of, depending on how important this is or how comfortable you feel, then you might go through just one or two reps of it, but now you already know it, so it should come back very, very quickly in your mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:44):
And it sounds like it's okay to have some bullet points at the end. It's hard for me to imagine going on stage with a bunch of people watching, not have any slide, bullet point, speaker notes. Any problems just having a couple of the bullet points of core points next to me?

Tristan de Montebello (01:34:01):
Before a talk, I might have four things written down. My one thing, and we'll talk about this in the bow and arrow, my one thing, the one thing I want people to remember and then the three bookmarks or pillars that I want to hit. And these are kind of cues or reminders that are going to send me into that part of the speech. So for example, if I'm talking about the accordion method, like what I just said, if I go back and I think through the pillars of this one. Well, my one thing would be the accordion method is more powerful than memorizing and then doing it the old way.

(01:34:35):
And then my bookmarks might be number one, describe the old way or the old way. Number two, the new way or the accordion method. And then number three might be internalize, don't memorize, and that'll be kind of the takeaway.

(01:34:53):
And if I have that in my mind, if I have 30 seconds, I can say the old way sucks because you have to work so hard and memorize everything and you're memorizing written stuff, the accordion method is much more powerful because you are going to compress it and go down and then open it up and then I'll explain that in a second and then I'll say, so you're internalized not memorized. What I realized right now is actually, it's funny enough though, those were the bookmarks there, so that sent me down that path. But actually I would say bookmark number two is probably the living room analogy. So it would be the old way sucks, the living room analogy, and then describe the accordion method.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:36):
That's cool. That was an awesome example of just the insights that appear by forcing yourself through this exercise. And it sounds like maybe the best use of this method is if you have a talk all of a sudden short term it's coming, all of a sudden you have to give a talk somewhere. There's a really powerful method to come up with a great talk that's maybe tomorrow, which you didn't expect.

Tristan de Montebello (01:35:58):
When I say I love this, I use this for myself, I use this with every single client I work with regardless of if it's a five-minute talk, a 20-minute keynote, we're using the accordion method, and you can use this at the macro level or at the micro level, so you can use it for the whole talk, but you can also say, "Hey, let's hone in on this part one that you're struggling with or part two and let's use the accordion to get clarity there."

(01:36:26):
So you can use the accordion as almost like a brainstorming way. I just want to see where I end up here and it takes maybe 15 minutes or something to go through a full accordion. It depends the time constraints you give yourself. Sometimes I'll just do two minute, one minute 30 seconds, that's even shorter, but I'll go through it for one piece of the puzzle or it's like, "Hey, we're almost there. Let's really internalize it. Let's clarify this. Let's get it really, really tight." And then I might say, "Okay, now let's do the whole thing through the accordion. So your 20-minute talk, I want to hear it in three minutes." That gets really, really interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:03):
Amazing. Okay. Anything else along the accordion method before we talk about the final technique before we wrap up?

Tristan de Montebello (01:37:10):
We have a full self-paced course on ultra speaking on the accordion. I think it costs like 30 bucks or something like that to access all of the games and all the platforms. A bunch of them are free, but I think this one's behind the paywall. But we also put together a resource where we go all the way, we describe all of the accordion method, the bow and arrow, staying character ending strong on a free email course that we put together. That's ultraspeaking.com/Lenny. So this is shameless self-promotion, but if you want it to go grab it there, you can grab it there and then the bow and arrow is going to tie into the accordion method as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:53):
Awesome. I'm glad you mentioned all that and we'll point people to that URL in the show notes. Okay, final topic is the bow and arrow technique. Let's talk about what that is and how folks can use that to give better talks.

Tristan de Montebello (01:38:05):
The bow and arrow starts with a, it's really a mindset shift that most of us are in the weeds, so we're very sensitive and familiar to all of the content that we're working on. If you're in data, then you have all of the data. If you're sharing ideas, you still have all of the ideas. And the mistake that most people do when they're preparing a talk, a presentation, an all hands a meeting, whatever it is we tend to focus more on what we want to say than what we want our audience to remember. So the mindset shift here is stop focusing as much on what you want to say and focus more on what you want your audience to remember.

(01:38:51):
What we found out is if you think about your last all hands, the last big meeting, the last talk you saw on YouTube or in person, you probably don't remember much. In fact, I wager you might only remember one thing from that talk. And that's what this is all based on. We call it the bow and arrow technique because we think you can only remember one thing out of a talk and that it's very powerful to go through that framework or that kind of thinking when you're building a talk. And the one thing is your arrow. And so when you have that one thing to me I say it's literally a single sentence that is the only sentence people would remember if they left your talk. Would you be satisfied with that sentence?

(01:39:37):
It takes some times to get to a good one, but if you have a good one, it unlocks everything. It's like you're having a north star or a compass in your pocket. You can always pull it out. You always know where you're going. It gives you a lot of clarity. It's also giving a lot of clarity to your audience obviously.

(01:39:54):
But you can't just throw an arrow at somebody's face. You need to notch it in the bow and pull the bow back. And so to pull the bow back, you need to add in weight to that sentence. And that often comes in the form of an interesting anecdote or a data point that's going to support that or a story that's going to add emotion or illustrate it. So you want to find ways in which you can give weight or pull back the bow so that your arrow has that much more impact. So usually the process of clarifying what your arrow is is a back and forth between the bow and the arrows. So if you're going down the accordion method after the first one you might write or before the first one, you might write a tentative arrow, "Here's my one thing", and then the next one you say, "Okay, actually my one thing might be a refined version of that."

(01:40:55):
And so you might rewrite it a little bit and then you might tentatively put in what you think the bow is. "I like the anecdote I used here. I like this data point that I thought was powerful and maybe I can end on this story or this call to action." Then you'll put that in and then you go back in and you give that a try and that's starting to simplify in your mind.

(01:41:17):
And as you go, usually one informs the other. By the time you finish the accordion for example, you should have a very clear arrow and those clear bookmarks, which is the bow. But really the thing to remember with the bow and arrow, if you can only remember one thing, is switch your mindset from what I want to say to what I want people to remember and limit whatever that is you want them to remember as much as possible and that's going to give you extreme clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:48):
That is really helpful. I'm preparing my talk for the summit, and so I'm going to use both of these exercises and what I take away from this last piece is as much as you may want to say a lot of things, really all someone's going to remember, as you said is one thing, if anything, but hopefully they remember that one thing.

(01:42:06):
So it's essentially what's the one thing you want people to remember and then what are the pieces of support that will convince them that that's right and that's something that'll stick with them?

Tristan de Montebello (01:42:16):
Exactly. And again, similar to the accordion method, this works in the macro and the micro. So if you have a talk where you're using slides, use it for the whole talk. But then for every single slide, ask yourself what is my one thing? And you might have some support there as well, but if you don't have a one thing for each slide, either the slide shouldn't exist or it should be multiple slides.

(01:42:45):
The symptom of not having a one thing is usually having a slide that says way too many things. I don't know what data point I want you to remember, so I'm going to put all of it on that slide. I'm not sure which piece of information is more important. So I'm going to write down all of my thoughts and I'm going to go through all of them or hope that you go through all of them and extract what you think is interesting. But the reality is people are just going to zone out if you do that. So if you do that slide by slide, you're going to gain incredible clarity and again, you're going to need less preparation and less memorization.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:21):
And to build on that, a pro-tip is to make that title of that slide exactly that one thing you want them to take away. Just put it there and tell them exactly what you want them to learn.

Tristan de Montebello (01:43:31):
Yes. I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:32):
Sweet. Tristan, we've been on a journey. This was a really unique experimental episode. I had a good time even though I did some hard things, you made me do hard things that are good for me. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything else you want to leave listeners with or a nugget you want to?

Tristan de Montebello (01:43:50):
I hope people found value. I mean, we did. This was really a group effort and I really appreciate you working on the agenda, really bringing in the games and trying to make this as practical as possible. I think the only thing I want to leave people with is again, this idea of how transformational tackling speaking can be, and the more constrained you feel with your speaking, the more transformational it will be to your life. So I just want to give this encouragement. It's much, much, much more enjoyable than you think it will be. It can actually be exhilarating and energizing and you feel like you can take over the world once you're on this journey. It's beautiful. And so I just encourage everybody, take the first step and start practicing your speaking.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:45):
Awesome. And I definitely felt that after doing the workshop of just I feel energized, I want to just talk all time, but then I'm like, I need more work. I need more practice. Tristan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tristan de Montebello (01:45:01):
Let's do this lightning round. Here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:04):
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Tristan de Montebello (01:45:10):
I was given a book by my first coach, Nathan Seward seven years ago called The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks that I've recommended so many times. And it's based on this idea that we tend to self-sabotage ourselves when we experience too much success or too much happiness. And that that's linked to I think five things that would happen to us when we're growing up. One of them is the... What is it, the wild poppy syndrome or something like that. Like the tallest poppy is the one that's cut first. So if you shine in a family of siblings, then anytime you shine too much we're going to say, "Hey, hey, hey, that's not cool for the others." So that's going to be internalized and hardwired in your body and as an adult, as soon as you start shining a little bit too much, you're going to do the same thing to yourself. So the idea is going from having this point above which you can't be happy to turning it into, he calls it an upward-facing spiral with no upper limit. It's a really exciting and empowering book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:20):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Tristan de Montebello (01:46:23):
I haven't watched much very recently, but I'll say one of my favorite TV shows of all time is the Peaky Blinders, English show with Cillian Murphy. I'm absolutely obsessed with that movie that show. I think it's a true masterpiece. And I've recently rewatched, so I'll qualify this as recent. I recently rewatched The Nice Guys with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, and I think it's just a brilliant comedy. Brilliant. Another masterpiece, I thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:58):
Do you have a favorite recent product that you have discovered that you really love. Could be an app, it could be something physical.

Tristan de Montebello (01:47:05):
I have a physical product actually right in front of me that was gifted to me by my business partner Michael Gendler, co-founder of Ultraspeaking. This is called an Ember Mug, and this keeps whatever you have in it, warm and it's extraordinary, whether you are a coffee drinker or a tea drinker, you know the feeling of pouring this and sipping it and by the fifth sip, it's cold. This keeps it at whatever temperature you want it to for however long you want. And I absolutely love it. I've been using it basically every day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:37):
I have one of those. I find myself, you could actually control it through the app. You can control the temperature through an app, which I love. I haven't been using mine, but I love the idea. I know a lot of friends love them. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Tristan de Montebello (01:47:56):
I think we are too future focused as a species or as a society and as a result, we're always looking for the next thing. So the motto I share with my friends and my business partners and my family the most I think is these are the good old days. And I remind myself, I'll tell you right now for you and for whoever's listening. I mean think about the podcast, it's never going to be this young, it's never going to feel like it feels right now. And it always feels like these things are eternal, but truly one day you're going to look back and you're think, "Man, those were really the good old days." And so I say it right now, enjoy because these are the good old days.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:40):
I love that. And it's so relevant with a young kid, you're always going to think about, "Oh, they're little." I love that. Final question. You were the fastest person to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. I imagine that was quite a journey. I'm curious if there's a story from that experience that comes to mind that's like a wild part of that journey or something that might surprise people.

Tristan de Montebello (01:49:09):
Well, the journey lasted almost seven months, and it was the craziest journey of my life. I went into that with no experience whatsoever speaking, so really just a random amateur, and I just climbed the ladder by outworking everybody. The story that came to mind right away was six days before the semifinals. So I'm six days before the semifinals and I've qualified for the semifinals two and a half months ago. So I'm nobody, now I'm going to the semifinals of the world championships of public speaking. So my mind really is struggling to compute, and I had finally unlocked a speech that I thought was worthy of giving on the final stage. You have to show up there for the semifinals with one speech, and then the next day, if ever you win, you're going to the finals and you have to have a brand new speech, a completely different speech that you're going to give on that stage.

(01:50:12):
So you need two speeches ready to go, and both of those speeches have to be in theory, world-class. I'm six days before. I was struggling at that, really, really struggling to get that speech together. I finally got something and Michael managed to get me. I was flying I think two days later to Vancouver for the semis, and Michael managed to unlock this one opportunity to speak in front of 50 people to give it a try. And so I ran there. I give the speech, and as usual, we film. I film every single speech. I gave more than a hundred speeches over seven months, and I filmed every single speech. And we'd get home, we'd ask everybody for feedback, and I get home and I'm thinking, "Man, something is wrong. Something is wrong." I was so pumped. I wept. I genuinely wept as I wrote the speech because it was so moving. It was all about my life. It was something that I was so connected to. I don't know, probably the emotion of the pressure as well, but that's how much I believed in that speech.

(01:51:14):
We get home, we put the speech on the computer, and as I get to the most important part of the speech, I see two things happen. So this is the moment where I'm expecting people to pull out their tissues. One person pulls up the agenda for the event that they're at and is starting to look at the agenda. Another person pulls out their phone, another person starts going through their purse, and I'm looking at this, and suddenly I realized, "Oh, this speech, nobody cares about this. This is not a good speech. This is terrible." And then I go through all of these feedbacks.

(01:51:53):
I have 50 pieces of feedback, and all I'm getting is, "Good luck for the semi-finals. It's going to go great. I thought it was good", and I'm like, "I'm going to humiliate myself. This is terrible." So I had waves of anxiety. I threw my speech away, and in five days from the ground up, I rebuilt a completely new speech that was basically the best of everything I'd explored, everything I'd experimented with over the course of the three months leading up to that, the jokes that worked the best, like a stand-up comic would. I built my special and I focused on different areas like all of the transitions.

(01:52:38):
And right before the semi-finals, I gave the speech to one person. I was in Vancouver trying to internalize my speech and memorizing it in a plaza where I delimited the size of the stage and I'm just giving my speech out loud to get over the nerves, so I'm ready for the pressure to see if my brain will remember it and everything.

(01:53:01):
Anyways, I gave it in front of one person who was our district director at Toastmasters, and this is a speech meant for 500 to a thousand people, not one person. So I was scared it would flop. But in the middle of the speech, which is a completely different one, I saw a tear roll down her cheek, and then she just hugged me and said, "You got it. You did it. You did it." I walked out on that stage and I made it, and I won the semi-finals with that speech.

(01:53:32):
I think to me, that was really the, it showed me that everything I'd done was worth something, that it actually worked. If I was able to build a speech in five days, that could get me a win at the semi-finals of the world championships. That was kind of the ultimate, "Wow, I won." So when I walked into the finals, to me, I felt like I had already won.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:57):
Wow, that is a story. What an arc. Amazing. I'm so happy you asked that question. Now I just want to watch that speech and I want to learn more about this whole championship of public speaking, which I have no insight into. That could be its own podcast interview.

(01:54:13):
But Tristan, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible. One of the most interesting episodes I've done. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about Ultraspeaking? I know you built a page where they could experiment with some of this stuff, so share that. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Tristan de Montebello (01:54:28):
If you go to ultraspeaking. com/Lenny, so ultra like U-L-T-R-A ultraspeaking.com/Lenny, we put together, you have five emails that go deep into a bunch of the things that we've talked here. You can also just go to Ultraspeaking.com where you'll get access to a bunch of the games for free, and you can check out everything else that we do. If you want to follow me or hit me up or ask me questions about this podcast, you can do that on Twitter @Montebello, M-O-N-T-E-B-E-L-L-O. And how can listeners be useful to me? Well, first of all, if you made it to here, then I really appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for being here with us, and what I would love for you to do is to apply this. We said in the beginning, you can't get better at speaking without speaking, and another piece of that puzzle is you want to do the thing that you're trying to get better at. So if you're nervous speaking in front of people, you want to speak in front of people as part of your practice. So the way you could be useful to me is introduce these games to somebody else. Try them for yourself, practice them with somebody else. Go through the accordion method with a friend. Try conductor, and when you succeed and when you have an awesome experience, then you can tell the world that Ultraspeaking helped you do that, and that would be huge.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:55:56):
Awesome. Tristan, thank you so much for being here.

Tristan de Montebello (01:56:01):
Thanks, Lenny. It was an honor.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:56:03):

# An inside look at how CNN builds product | Upasna Gautam

## Transcript

Upasna Gautam (00:00):
It happens all the time, right? That is the nature of breaking news. I mean, you have to be ready to pivot at the drop of a hat. I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over everything. So what do you do in that situation? You can be frustrated, absolutely it's frustrating. But we always have to have the ability to A, pivot of course, but also have backup and buffers in those types of scenarios.
Lenny (00:45):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Upasna Gautam. Upasna is a product manager at CNN, where she leads the team responsible for the content management system that journalists use to write and publish their stories. She's also on the frontlines of elevating the discipline of product management within newsrooms through her work at the News Product Alliance. She's also a longtime meditation and mindfulness teacher, which as we discuss ends up being pretty damn handy working at a place like CNN. We dig into how the product team operates within CNN, how they collaborate with journalists for breaking news, dress rehearsals, and also some simple tricks to build your own mindfulness in your day-to-day work as a PM.

Upasna Gautam (03:15):
Thank you Lenny, I'm so excited to be here.
Lenny (03:18):
As you probably know, I'm on this kind of quest to understand how different companies build product, especially companies that are kind of outside the Silicon Valley, just like standard tech scene. And I've always wondered what it was like to build product at a company like CNN, which is very different from where most, I don't know, tech PMs work. And so I'm really excited to have you on and to give us a little glimpse into what it's like to build product at CNN.
Upasna Gautam (03:42):
Awesome, I'm very excited to share as well.
Lenny (03:44):
So I was doing a little research on you before this chat, and I noticed that you've been teaching and studying meditation and mindfulness for, I don't know, maybe a decade? And I imagine that comes in handy at a company like CNN, which also I imagine is quite hectic at times with breaking news all the time. And so here's my question, what have you learned or brought from that practice to your ability to lead and ability to just like keep your team calm and focused during I imagine many hectic moments?
Upasna Gautam (04:16):
Love that question, and working in product in news is a very [inaudible 00:04:22]. We hear a lot about having the skills to thrive in ambiguity in order to be a successful product manager, but to be a successful product manager in news you have to be able to thrive in chaos. And equanimity is the most important skill I've developed I think across my entire life, and it's due to all of those years of practicing mindfulness and meditation. And equanimity is one of my favorite words, it means mental calmness, composure, evenness of temper, especially in crazy, stressful situations. It's the ability to remain un-rattled in like the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. And if you think about it in the dynamic of a workplace or human interaction, it's really the ability to pause before reacting.
(05:11):
And reactivity is the root cause of so many of our workplace woes and product management frustrations, and when you're able to pause before reacting you can start to undo and break a lot of those negative patterns in your brain. And in news, and especially the world's biggest breaking news organization, you can cut through that chaos with equanimity because it also really gives you this outsized advantage in everything from stakeholder management, team morale, to the way you're able to translate user feedback, to product development philosophy. And the thing is is you're always going to hear things and feedback that you don't like, and opinions that you don't like, and you're going to get frustrated. That's product management, that's life.
(05:59):
But real power to me comes from equanimity, and that comes from managing your emotional reactions, and not trying to control others. So I think when you're able to cultivate that level of self-awareness for yourself, you're able to chart a clear path forward for your team and serve as a compass in the chaos.
Lenny (06:22):
Is there a story or an example that comes to mind where things were just like, "Oh shit," and you were able to tap into that skill that you built to stay calm and focused, or even just like help your team stay focused?
Upasna Gautam (06:33):
I mean, it happens all the time right? That is the nature of breaking news. I mean, you have to be ready to pivot at the drop of a hat. And so I think more than just like the big, chaotic moments in those daily interactions when there's chaos, I think that's when it really shows its power and helps me navigate those day-to-day interactions when I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over everything. So what do you do in that situation? You can be frustrated, absolutely it's frustrating. But you always have to have the ability to, A, pivot of course, but also have backup and buffers in those types of scenario. So any time we're planning we build in buffers for all of that chaos that's happening on a daily basis.
Lenny (07:41):
Wow, that's cool. Is that a real thing that happened? You were like, in a big meeting with all the researchers and then something went off the rails in the world?
Upasna Gautam (07:47):
Oh yeah, absolutely. Happens all the time.
Lenny (07:49):
I don't know how much you can go into all this, but what is it that you would do in that case, like as a product team? What are they looking for you to do at that moment?
Upasna Gautam (07:56):
For us it's not really anything we have to do. It is more so, "Okay, well our goal at this session was to get user testing done, or user feedback from that user testing session with our editors. And so, what do we do? Okay, well good thing we had a backup planned, right?" We don't actually have to go into that scenario, but since our editors and our journalists are customers we're there to serve their needs, but they're not here to serve our needs. They have a whole another job that they have to do. And so we have to have the ability to adapt and accommodate to those really chaotic schedules across global time zones. And so that happens again like, it's not like once in a while, it's a very regular thing that we have to be aware of and also account for.
Lenny (08:46):
Okay, again, it's like the journalists are the ones in the meeting that like, "Oh, they have to go write about the stuff uncovered."
Upasna Gautam (08:50):
Totally.
Lenny (08:51):
I see, that makes sense. You said that you built in some buffer time to kind of account for these things. Is there like a systematic way of doing that, or is it just broadly, "Let's add buffer time"? Is there like a rule of thumb you think about there?
Upasna Gautam (09:02):
It depends on the scope of the work we're doing at that time. So one of my main responsibilities is to rebuild our content management system, which also involves onboarding our editors and journalists to it off of our legacy platform and onto our new one. So when we're thinking about onboarding especially the teams, our onboarding cycle's very long. It involves training, testing, lots of dialogue and feedback. And then only do we actually test, and then we onboard. And so it is a long cycle, and it's longer than it maybe seems like it needs to be because we have to build in those buffers. Sometimes that buffer is a day or two, and sometimes it's a week or a month. And sometimes when we think we need a buffer, we get it done in a day and we quickly move onto the next phase.
(09:53):
And so I think that quick decision-making in those times is super-important, because you have to be able to assess the situation as it stands. And so I think mindfulness is so important too in practices like this, because being able to objectively see the scenario for what it is, make a quick decision and move on to the next phase is something we have to analyze every single day.
Lenny (10:16):
Makes me think a little bit about a lot of CEOs are very busy and pulled into a lot of things, and so you have to kind of account for their schedule. And it sounds like you have many, many people that you work with that have crazy schedules.
Upasna Gautam (10:29):
Yes.
Lenny (10:30):
I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into how you, your team works with the news team. It's such a unique way of working, most product teams don't have a whole set of journalists that they have to work with as stakeholders. So I'm curious specifically, say a journalist has like, "Hey, I'd love to build a special immersive experience for this story," or, "I need some special feature to help support this work that I'm doing." How does that work? Do they come to you, and, "Okay, here's a roadmap [inaudible 00:10:57] maybe in the quarter [inaudible 00:10:59]." Imagine it's like, "I need this next week." How do you work with the journalist team, basically, on product?
Upasna Gautam (11:04):
Yep. This is pretty much the foundation of all of my work. We talk to our editorial staff every single day, and after a lot of observation and learning I implemented a system to manage that kind of intake with four different touch points or events. So we have weekly demo days, working sessions, breaking news dress rehearsals, and office hours. So with weekly demo days, I facilitate those with my product design lead and my tech lead. And we use that as an open form of communication to deep dive into features that exist on our platform, also to preview or give a sneak peek of new features to come, and kind of recreate their workflows and do a show and tell. Again, we wanted to open that up as a forum to not just our editorial partners but also anyone across the business who is interested in learning about the product and which is our platform.
(12:00):
And it was also a great way to kind of evangelize the product too. Coming off of a legacy system after several years onto a brand-new one is a big change at a place like CNN, and so we definitely tried to make sure that smart repetition in different ways is top priority. So, weekly demo days is one. Working sessions are interesting. I use the term working session because it's a combination of several things. This is a really critical part of our onboarding process where we gather breakout groups of our journalists and editors to work with us to recreate their workflows in the new platform. This allows us to address any friction or issues of course that are occurring in their workflows. But also we're able to gather a lot of awesome feedback from them in those sessions.
(12:54):
We used to call them user testing sessions, but decided to move away from that and just call them working sessions so they're more collaborative. And again, it's a really critical part of our onboarding process. We usually do three to six of them depending on the size of the group before the team is actually onboarded for two hours per session. So they're like deep dives into their specific workflows, so as you can imagine the way the politics team programs content is wildly different than the way the entertainment team does, or the way that the health team does, and very different than the way that the CNN homepage even interacts. So all of those are separate teams we have to work with when it comes to getting feedback. So in addition to that, we also do I mentioned breaking news dress rehearsals.
(13:44):
And you can imagine this is exactly what it sounds like. We create a script and do a simulation of a breaking news scenario to stress test our platform, because all breaking news scenarios are definitely not the same either. So this gives us a lot of great feedback in that short amount of time at the speed of breaking news. And then last but not least, we have office hours which I just started last year, and that's also probably what you can imagine, open blocks of time where me and my product design partner and my tech lead are just there to answer questions, help people troubleshoot any friction they might be experiencing in their workflow, get their feedback. We just wanted to open up another line of communications, so we do those right now once a week. Sometimes they go up to two times a week if we're in a really vigorous onboarding phase.
(14:33):
After those conversations and sessions and events happen, you know it's our job to translate their needs into the functions that we, A, either maybe already have that we can optimize, B, we build anew, or we tell them it's not viable. And the good thing is that because they've been along for the ride with us throughout the product discovery process we've earned their trust and respect. So that when we tell them something like it's not viable, they usually get it.
Lenny (15:07):
Man, I have so much questions about just working with journalists. I feel like pushing back on a journalist is probably extra hard versus other types of stakeholders.
Upasna Gautam (15:14):
It is.
Lenny (15:15):
Can we zoom out a little bit, and you talked about what you work on at CNN, which is the content management system and things around that. Can you just talk about whatever you can share, just like what does the product team look like at CNN, how many PMs are there, how's like the product work structured and where do you fit in there?
Upasna Gautam (15:31):
Yes. I mentioned earlier my team sits on CNN Digital, and I think when most people think of CNN of course you think of TV and linear programming. I have nothing to do with that, CNN Digital is digital, and it's made up of several teams that are structured around a lot of different product areas. It includes everything from the content management platforms that I work on, to data infrastructure, to personalization, to video experience, which includes like the products of video editor, and the video player, to podcasts, there's a lot. So each of those are product teams. And so we also split out... The way CNN is split out into CNN Digital is because there's a separate core content platform that powers broadcast and linear TV.
(16:21):
And the one that I work on powers CNN Digital. So on my team, the core platform team, our stakeholders and our customers, like I mentioned, are journalists and are editors. Which presents a really unique dynamic, and it's one that I love. We have direct access to our customers at all times of day, for better or for worse, and they're embedded into our product development process. And each of those teams under CNN Digital is kind of like a squad, very similar to how it is at other larger tech companies. We have PMs, we have engineers, designers, and delivery managers embedded in those squads. And since my team is a core platform team, our main responsibility is to A, build our newer, faster, more flexible content management platform to replace our legacy one, and B, onboard our entire editorial staff to it.
(17:19):
And so even more specifically my role is focused on rebuilding the tooling and the editorial experience of that platform, as well as doing the actual onboarding of our journalists. So we work cross-functionally because our team kind of is the umbrella over a lot of different teams, so we truly work cross-functionally to make sure that we're serving our journalists with the tools that they need to do their job in the most efficient way possible.
Lenny (17:48):
What would surprise people most about how product is built at CNN?
Upasna Gautam (17:54):
I think the most surprising thing may actually be that there's just so many different types of products that we build. Like I said, I think when most people think of CNN you see TV, and you think of Anderson Cooper, and all of the things that are very publicly visible. Most of our product work and product teams all sit behind the scenes, and so I think just that in itself, like the sheer size of that is surprising to a lot of people. So I mentioned like all of the different teams, product teams that are based off of function, content management platforms, infrastructure, personalization, video, podcasts, linear TV. And I think that in itself, like the sheer size of it, we're not the size of Google by any means. But at the same time we have the expertise and the depth and breadth of a lot of those larger tech companies.
Lenny (18:52):
I'm curious about the day-to-day operational work of how you build product at CNN. So our first question here is just, you use like OKRs, and OKRs with like key objectives, and outcomes, and 70% of a goal is success.
Upasna Gautam (19:06):
Yeah, absolutely, we do. We've used OKRs for a long time, and they've served as an anchor for my team over the last three years. I can't go into specifics on like what our OKRs are, but I did kind of cover the two main parts of it, which is rebuilding our content management platform and onboarding our users to it. So again, it's a long game at CNN when you're working on a core platform to replace a legacy one. And so we break those OKRs down of course even further into, we look two to three years out and build goals based off of that. Then we break them down by quarter and month, and then out of that for my team and what I do I need to, for my own sake and my team's sake, break those down by the week. And when we're in rapid development phases, we're planning on a daily basis.
Lenny (20:01):
How about in terms of just planning broadly? How far out does the product team at CNN plan in detail, like have an actual roadmap? And is that standardized across teams, or can each team kind of do their own approach?
Upasna Gautam (20:13):
It's a combination of both. So we have one that is an over-arching roadmap that tracks to like our company OKRs and our product organization OKRs. And then from there I mentioned we have our squads, product teams, and we have OKRs on those as well track up to the larger, broader ones. And so once we get down to that level though, there is flexibility and we have autonomy to tackle those how we want. Which is really great, because the scope of work across our different product teams is drastically different. Working on core platform, like I do, versus working on video experience, versus podcasts. I mean, it's apples and oranges. And so it's really awesome that we have the flexibility to kind of make it work for us, while also having these larger goals that we know that, "Okay, this is what we need to work towards."
(21:12):
And I mean, like the saying we always hear in product, of, "Stay firm on the goal, but flexible on the process." And we've definitely been able to use that and leverage that in the way that we track against our goals.
Lenny (21:27):
Something else that a lot of people are always curious about is product review meetings and design review meetings. You talked about a couple of these meetings that you have, but do you have standard product review meetings where folks get together and just review stuff and progress? And if so, how do they work? Like who runs them, who comes to them, how do you make decisions, things like that?
Upasna Gautam (21:46):
We have multiple variations of those. Some are standing ceremonies of course, and some are ad-hoc. Again, it's really based on the work we're doing in whatever phase we're in. But when it comes to product review, and product discovery or design review meetings, in addition to my design lead I've made it a point to bring in my tech lead and engineers along for this product discovery ride, and that's definitely been a game-changer as well. When our engineers are able to understand our journalists' needs at the same level as we are, they're able to define the how to do it with so much greater clarity and precision. And so my tech lead is embedded also in our product discovery process, he joins our user testing sessions, and our design jams, and our editorial conversation planning sessions.
(22:37):
And it's helped him and the rest of our tech and engineering team become experts on the why are we doing this and what are we working towards, to better determine technical feasibility. And he's done an amazing job of also passing that knowledge down to the rest of our engineers on our team, so it's really like this mentality of getting that important feedback from our journalists, understanding their pain points and then sharing and teaching it across the team. And I think the key takeaway on that is it's so important to think of your engineers as partners and not just resources. And when they are embedded into the process right upfront, it makes the whole process in general more efficient.
Lenny (23:21):
So it sounds like that was maybe an evolution of the way the team works, as engineering has been looped into a lot of this early stuff more recently?
Upasna Gautam (23:30):
Totally, yeah. Recently-
Lenny (23:33):
Cool.
Upasna Gautam (23:33):
... meaning, I mean... Again, long game right? Because it's been a couple of years.
Lenny (23:39):
Got it. Going in a slightly different direction, I'm curious if there's any fun or unique traditions or rituals that the CNN product team has. These are always fun to hear about.
Upasna Gautam (23:51):
I'll be very honest, we are not one of the cool teams. The politics team and the breaking news teams have all these cool rituals and fun things that they do.
Lenny (24:02):
What kind of stuff do they do?
Upasna Gautam (24:03):
It's different also because they're usually in-person in the newsroom and I work remotely, and so... And actually most of my team works remotely. And so they have their rituals, but I will say one of the things that we started to do is... So onboarding teams has been a big goal of ours, and that we've slowly checked off the list over 2022. And any time we successfully onboard a team or launch a new feature, it's not anything crazy or fun, like there's only so much you can do when you work remotely. But we definitely make it a point to celebrate, and it's been hard to figure out ways to keep team morale up when you're all-remote. And it started with... We knew we needed to start doing something when we would have a big launch, and it was so anticlimactic.
(24:51):
And we literally hit publish and onboard onto like a politics page, and we were like, "Oh, okay, so I guess that's it." So one thing we started doing is sending like these gift boxes of like random tchotchkes and stuff that mean things to us from the whole year, and it's like just cheap little gag gifts and stuff that we send to each other. I have random stuff all over my desk, I don't even know if I can share some of it. So we try to make it a point to at least share and celebrate, and then when we're in-person we do too. But again, being remote, there's definitely a challenge there.
Lenny (25:32):
Are you ever able to get like a cameo from an Anderson Cooper, or someone else on-air to thank the teams? That feels like a cool feature potentially.
Upasna Gautam (25:41):
So one of my key stakeholders, she leads the video team at CNN, and she is a... We've had some discussions about doing a sizzler reel for our content management platform, since we're onboarding people and building new features. And there have been discussions with her about getting a celebrity to come and promote the product for us, so working on it.
Lenny (26:07):
Yeah, it feels like a missed opportunity, you've got so much talent around.
Upasna Gautam (26:11):
Totally.
Lenny (26:12):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.
(26:52):
But getting a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter, Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to Vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today. Coming back a little bit to the way y'all built product, I'm curious how you balance new product work and new features versus maintenance and bugs. Do you have kind of a... Is there like a philosophy at CNN of how much goes to bugs, maintenance versus new stuff, or is it per team and just, how do y'all think about that?
Upasna Gautam (27:45):
It's certainly team-specific, because again, the scope of work across teams really varies. But since my team's product is an entire platform, it's my job to ensure we're still clear on our goals because like I said, they may change on a week-by-week basis. One sprint might be high-priority feature development, in another sprint maybe we're focused on medium-priority optimizations and bug fixes. But we know that any time there's a critical incident in production, it also takes critical priority over everything else. So it's a balancing and juggling act that relies heavily on intuitive decision-making. But I will say we're also really fortunate to have a global, 24/7 editorial support team that we work really closely with.
(28:35):
So they are the ones who handle, troubleshoot, escalate incidents up to the relevant teams. There are a lot of layers to that protocol when a critical incident occurs. And so our editorial support team is that first layer of support, whereas my team might be the second or third depending on the level of severity and who it gets escalated to. So there's definitely a lot of processes in place, we're not always that first line of defense, which is actually... It alleviates a lot of stress, to know that we have an entire team around the clock globally dedicated just to that.
Lenny (29:12):
When you're talking about these incidents and moments it makes me wonder, is there a memory of just like a wild time of something happened in the news, or just like, "Oh man, we've got to get on top of this thing"? Is there like a memory that you think of like, "Wow, that was crazy"?
Upasna Gautam (29:26):
It's funny but also crazy and amazing, is... So our new content management platform, we've been building it for a while and stress testing it for a while. And politics and election season at CNN is Superbowl like times a hundred. And so we have to be all hands on deck, like all layers of support intact. And so we have also a lot of layers of fallback in case something happened, right? Like there's layers and layers of infrastructure fallback if CNN.com goes down, or another service goes down. And so it actually did happen a couple of years ago in the 2020 election, and one of the fallbacks at that time, because we were not...
(30:14):
We're still on our current content management platform, but we had our new one as we're building it as one of the levels of fall. And if X, Y, Z fails, then it goes to our current platform, and it did. And so that's actually happened, where our new platform saved the day even though it wasn't fully ready. But that just goes to show we think about that kind of stuff like in granular detail, when we think about everything that could possibly go wrong. Because it has happened, and it will happen, and it does go wrong. So that was kind of cool, it was validation to know that the platform we have is really stable, and strong, and secure, that it was a fallback for the election.
Lenny (31:03):
Okay, and it must have felt good, it feels like a promotion material right there that your work-in-progress system saved the day.
Upasna Gautam (31:10):
Yeah, I agree.
Lenny (31:12):
You talked about how you have like these breaking news dress rehearsals. I just noted that, and I thought it would be cool to just revisit that briefly. Like, how does that work? You just get the team together, and like, "Here's a news story that just broke. What do we do?" Like, how does that work?
Upasna Gautam (31:27):
It is scripted, right. So we can only get so close to the real thing. But one thing we do is we script everything, like the teams and the players that we need involved in it, what the incident is. And it usually starts when breaking news occurs with an email, the news-gathering team sends an email to our writers and our producers. And then from there it goes out all the places it needs to go. There's a video that needs to be created, there's an article that needs to be written. Again, the TV side I have no insight into, it's like a foreign land to me. But as far as the digital scope goes, there's a lot of work that has to be done. Even things like photo and imagery, we have a whole team dedicated just to selecting photos.
(32:11):
The photo desk is very involved with that process. And so that is all scripted out, and so we say, "Okay, here's the news, here's how it's going to break," and then we run it. And so we use interpersonal communication tools at work of course, email, and we run the whole thing from the minute the email is sent to... And of course since we're testing the platform with this breaking news dress rehearsal, to the minute you hit publish on that page. And there's a lot of stuff that goes on in there, and it all happens in the span of minutes. And so while that is happening, while that dress rehearsal is happening, we have our engineers and our editorial support team on hand as well. So they're observing what's happening while it's usually me and one of our editorial stakeholders and leads facilitating the actual rehearsal part.
(33:02):
And you know, getting user feedback on, "Okay, did something break, did everything work as it was supposed to work?" And also allows us to understand like how far we can go with stress testing different features on our system. So each one is different, but it's a crazy amount of stuff and information you can gather in such a short span of time. Because if it cannot serve the needs of breaking news, then it's useless. So it's a lot of work that goes into it for this three-minute event.
Lenny (33:35):
That is cool. It feels like just a cool tactic you could use anywhere, and that's a good segue to the next question I had, is just having built product at CNN and seeing how the product team works, what is it that you think you'll take with you to future product teams and future companies if you ever move on to anything else?
Upasna Gautam (33:53):
So I of course can't speak for the entire scene and product team, but I can speak for myself and my specific team. In order to stay competitive in our modern news landscape, building this content management platform and the technology behind it has taught us how to enable rapid development and integration of new features and workflows. And we've been able to quickly test hypotheses while reducing risk, and again, time is of the essence when it comes to breaking news. And when you layer that with a very complex content management technology, there's a lot of moving parts. And we've been able to do that successfully, and it's pretty amazing. And because of that we've developed, I think, this unique skill of high agency under high pressure.
(34:49):
And I really think that that skill or combination of skills is our superpower, and that is something you can take anywhere, that is something that is an asset to any product development team.
Lenny (35:03):
Let's circle back to our original topic about mindfulness and meditation. Other than just living through it and either becoming a meditation expert or having worked at a company like CNN that has a lot of this, is there any, I don't know, tactic you could share, something that someone could take tomorrow and be like, "Okay, I'm going to get better at dealing with crazy, unexpected events," based on the experience you've had?
Upasna Gautam (35:25):
Two parts to this. So one, I would be remiss as a meditation educator if I didn't say that there is no substitution for meditation. So just do it, it takes a long time, and it's a lifelong work-in-progress. But the good thing is that it also... Like the more you do it and consistently you do it, it compounds over time. Okay, if you think of any job description for a product manager it's mostly the same core stuff. You need to be able to lead a team without having authority, you need to have great communication skills, you need to be able to bribe in ambiguity, you need to be able to work with a lot of different people on the technical side and business side, all of the stuff that we hear all the time right?
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]But how do you actually become better at those things? Like, there's only so much you can gain from reading a book. To me it's either A, you've got to go do it, and B, meditation has helped so much because of the clarity of mind and clarity of thinking you're able to cultivate because of it, especially when it comes to communication. And this comes back to another tactic I think. So meditation is one, you can't get around it. It's a very, very powerful tool, I will die on that hill. But thinking about workplace tactics, communication is so essential. When I started at CNN it was a very new chapter for me, it's my first official product management role after working a decade in tech, in data and search infrastructure.
(36:57):
And it was really scary to make that change so far into my career. But when I asked my boss why he took such a big chance on me he said, "It's because of your communication skills and relationship-building skills, and that I've seen you in a room where engineers listen to you and what you have to say, and you listen to them." And he was like, "That in itself is really, really hard to teach." And I was like, "Okay, yeah, I can do that." So when I think about what communication means I also attach that to mindfulness. Like mindful communication is so critical for successful product management, no matter what type of product environment you're in. And it means being like deeply aware of the conversation you're having.
(37:43):
And when I'm having this conversation with you, I'm only having this conversation with you. When I'm talking to my design lead, I'm only talking to my design lead. When one of my journalists is venting because this feature is not working the way we told them it was going to, I am shutting my mouth and I'm listening to them vent, and then I'm extracting what the root cause of the problem is. And I think the takeaway and the tactic is that goes back to exactly what we talked about in the beginning is the ability to pause before reacting is the key to mindful communication and being a successful product manager. I think a lot of times we are taught to have all the answers, or we're expected to have all of the answers.
(38:27):
And people assume we have all of the answers so it's a really frustrating, sometimes, place to be in. But, if you listen and you know where to go to get the answers, that in itself is like a tremendous place to be. So I think the power of meditation, being able to pause before reacting lets you do things like conversate in the language of the listener. So when I'm talking to my journalists I'm not using technical terms or like content management technology terms. They have a whole different vocabulary that they use, they have shortcuts that they have lingo for in our content management system. They call things nicknames, and so you have to speak many different languages as a product manager. And if there's one thing that learning and teaching mindfulness has strengthened, it is that communication, yes, it's very important.
(39:24):
How do you become an effective communicator? I think a lot of times we think of speaking articulately first and foremost, or we think about writing well, which those two are really, really important things. But those can't be effective for us as product leaders if we're not listening, so I think listening and being able to converse in the language of the listener is the utmost importance. And how do you do that in your day-to-day? It's like, okay, if you're having a conversation with your customer are you actually listening to what they say, or are you going in with your own assumptions? Because maybe you're a user of the product. And it was very interesting, because I actually started writing freelance for CNN this past year.
(40:12):
And I was like, "Oh, okay, I'm a user now." And no I'm not, I'm not going to say that it helped me understand their pain points so much more and where they're coming from in a whole different light. But again, I am merely a proxy, I'm not actually the user. What they do is still drastically different. And so when having those customer interactions and stakeholder interactions, the priority should be to listen. And I think that is one of the most important things I've learned, and it's also helped build trust and respect between a previously fragmented structure where product and editorial didn't talk to each other, and now we're a unified partnership.
Lenny (41:00):
Oh, I love that. I love the reminder that a lot of communication is incredibly important for product managers, and so much of it is not actually you talking, it's you being really good at listening, and that makes you a better communicator. I imagine some people listening to this are going to be like, "Yeah, meditation, I should be doing that." What's like one thing someone could do to move forward on the path to starting to meditate? Is there a resource to recommend, a tip of just starting to do something there?
Upasna Gautam (41:27):
Totally. I think when people think of meditation, you immediately think of sitting on a mediation cushion like a monk for an hour. And that doesn't have to be true, especially if you're just starting. And there's also of course social media has commercialized what meditation is a lot as well. But at its core, all it is is being deeply aware of the present moment. So I always tell people who are for example like really busy moms who have no time in the morning for an hour-long meditation is, "Okay, take something in your day that you do every single day. You brush your teeth every morning, right? Okay, take brushing your teeth. Can you brush your teeth and just brush your teeth? And when you're brushing your teeth you are engaging all of your senses, and being fully present and aware of how it feels, how it smells, how it sounds."
(42:27):
That's two, three minutes of your day. That's meditation, and I think it's an amazing way and an easy way... Oh, sorry, not easy. Simple, not easy way, always, to think about what meditation actually is. Is like, instead of like having to uproot your whole life and the way you live to bring meditation in, think about what you already do every day and how you can just be more present, like fully present. And that's one of the core examples I give, is start with brushing your teeth and just brush your teeth. There's an old app I've been using for a long time if you're into that, I stopped using it recently but it's still amazing. It's called Insight Timer, the free version is amazing. It started as like a single-frame app probably about 10 years ago, and it's turned into this...
(43:18):
They've done amazing things with that product. So that's what I recommend, but again, you don't... I think, again, when people have a vision of meditation in their mind they're like, "Well I need these tools, and I need these resources, and I need these things, and I need knowledge." You don't need anything, you need five minutes and yourself, and that's it.
Lenny (43:37):
Amazing. I imagine many people listening to this coming into thinking, "I'm going to learn about CNN and how they build product," and then get a free meditation lesson. What a bonus, that was awesome. I'm going to be brushing my teeth very mindfully today-
Upasna Gautam (43:49):
Love it.
Lenny (43:49):
... my takeaway.
Upasna Gautam (43:50):
Love it.
Lenny (43:52):
Final question, around something that I know is important to you, that is basically there's this growing shift of product thinking in the news industry at large. And I know that's something that you're passionate about and something you're trying to create, is just to kind of move the media industry and the news industry toward more product thinking. So I'd love for you to just talk about what you're doing there, what's happening there, and then maybe if there's anything people could do to help in that effort.
Upasna Gautam (44:16):
Compared to the rest of product management as a discipline and the tech industry, product management in news is still in its, I will say infancy. And that's just because it hasn't been an integrated role for as long as it has been in big tech. But it is starting to become more and more not just prominent now, but people are realizing the value and power of it because especially in smaller newsrooms... I mean, CNN, places like The New York Times, The Washington Post, we have great, embedded, strong product teams. But that is not the case for the majority of newsrooms across the country and the world. Newsrooms are strapped for resources, they are strapped in all resources, including financial resources.
(45:07):
And so first, bringing in product and tech talent is expensive, and that in itself has forced editorial staff and journalists to take on other jobs that they never signed up for. And so they've had to learn how to do things product management, and engineering, and coding hacks, because there was nobody else to do it. And so it's interesting because a lot of times when you talk to editors and journalists, they're doing so many other things other than just their reporting of the news, right? They've had to take on other roles because of those restraints in the newsroom. And so there was a group established and a community established during the pandemic called the News Product Alliance. And there was like a realization occurring all at the same time that, "Wow, there's a lot of us doing this work.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]"Like, what do we call it? Is this product management?" And it was, it's product management at so many different levels. And so the News Product Alliance was formed during the pandemic in 2020 I believe by several media and news executives, who had been there and have seen people in their newsrooms do that. And the goal of it is to increase the awareness and education of product thinking and product management in newsrooms, while also increasing the diversity of thought and the diversity of people in those positions as well. And making the resources more readily available, especially for those smaller newsrooms that don't have the money to hire tech talent. And that in itself has...
(46:56):
So that group, the News Product Alliance, has grown dramatically in the past three years since I've been a part of it, since the beginning. And we regularly produce the resources that are catered... Product management resources that are catered to working in a newsroom, because it is different, it is very unique. But there are of course frameworks and processes that are still relevant, right? Like editors who have been cobbling together how to make this thing that they want, but hey, maybe this PRD framework will help you, just to keep it on track. So these very simple, like rudimentary types of things have helped them so much. And so last year we kicked off a mentorship network in which we had about 400 people apply.
(47:46):
We accepted 150 mentees from across the world, and matched them with 50 mentors from different newsrooms across the world in leadership positions. And each mentee defined a goal that they wanted to work on, and all of course having to do with product management. And some of them were creating a product management role for themselves in the newsroom. Some of it was creating a product management practice, maybe they were given the title of product manager and said, "Okay, you can hire a couple of people." But it was all on them, and they had no idea what to do, right? And so some of it, it's across the board, and it's amazing to see people doing this from scratch who never in a million years thought they'd walk into it.
(48:32):
You know, they're not coming from big tech, they don't have startup backgrounds. They had journalism degrees from around the world, and they're learning how to do product, and build... Not just learning how to do it, they're building product practices, they're actually building and developing products and features, and they're creating more leaders in this space as well, and across their newsrooms to empower each other. So it's been really amazing to see, and it's the most valuable professional organization I've been a part of just because it is so niche that talking about product management is always fun. But when you talk about it at a level that specific, it becomes even more valuable.
Lenny (49:16):
That is some really impactful product work. Where can people find that if they want to maybe participate, maybe apply if you're doing another cohort in the future?
Upasna Gautam (49:24):
Go to Newsproduct.org, there is a very active Slack group with a couple thousand people in it, a very active and popular job board as well. And you just have to submit an application on the website... A form, sorry, on the website to join the Slack, and ten you'll get an invitation to join the Slack. And then you'll have all of the resources at your fingertips, it's very low barrier to entry, and we want everyone and everyone who is interested in the intersection of news and product to be a part of it. And the cool thing about it is like I mentioned, it's a global network. We have people from the biggest newsrooms across the world, to all of the regional ones, to even big tech, one of my fellow board members was doing news at Twitter.
(50:10):
One was working on the Google News Initiative. So it's a really, really awesome group of people, and everyone is so hungry and passionate about sharing and paying it forward.
Lenny (50:23):
We'll put a link to this in the show notes. One last question, and what kind of people are you looking for? Who should apply, if they're listening?
Upasna Gautam (50:29):
If you are interested in working in news and have a product background, or the inverse of that, if you work in news and you're interested in breaking into product. So either side of the coin or any combination of that, news media, product technology, even... We have a lot of audience development, and analytics, and data science folks in there too. It's just an amazing community for knowledge sharing in tech and news, so there will be a fit for you somewhere, or to learn something, or at the very least to meet other really amazing people.
Lenny (51:07):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, and are you ready?
Upasna Gautam (51:14):
I'm ready.
Lenny (51:16):
All right. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people, or that you've recommended most?
Upasna Gautam (51:21):
One, Mindfulness in Plain English. Two, How To Win Friends and Influence People. I have to attribute a lot of my communication skills to my dad forcing me to read that book when I was like 10 years old, and-
Lenny (51:36):
Wow, 10 years old. Intense.
Upasna Gautam (51:39):
He was an engineer, and they were in their very beginning phases of introducing... Well, at that time there was no product, but product-type stuff into his engineering practice. And so he had to read the book and was like, "You need to read this book." So I never forgot about it. And then the third one is actually, it's not a book, but it's an article that I think is still very powerful and relevant to this day. It's The New Product Development Game, published by Harvard Business Review in 1986. And it looks at a really different approach, one that I resonate a lot with because it's a lot along the lines of how we work at CNN, around rapid development, and time and flexibility being like key anchors of successful product development. So, I threw that in there as well.
Lenny (52:29):
Favorite recent movie or TV show? And it can't be White Lotus.
Upasna Gautam (52:32):
Okay, I haven't even seen that show.
Lenny (52:34):
Okay, great. That's come up so many times, we've got to not allow it anymore.
Upasna Gautam (52:38):
TV show is a toss up between The Mandalorian and Ted Lasso. I know it's not very new, but I don't watch tons and tons of TV, and I usually find like the few that I latch onto, and then I get obsessed with, and then I've got to take a break for a while. So, those are my last two obsessions. Movie is Everything Everywhere All At Once, the last amazing one that really, really struck a chord with me.
Lenny (53:02):
If you like Mandalorian check out Andor, it's incredible.
Upasna Gautam (53:05):
Oh yeah, it's good too.
Lenny (53:06):
It's like the best Star Wars thing. Okay, you've seen it. Okay, great, you're on it.
Upasna Gautam (53:09):
I still love Mandalorian more, I do like that one too.
Lenny (53:11):
Wow.
Upasna Gautam (53:12):
My husband is obsessed.
Lenny (53:15):
Okay, okay. Wow, contrarian. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?
Upasna Gautam (53:21):
What's something that would not exist without your initiative?
Lenny (53:28):
Mm-hmm. And what do you look for in an answer that's a sign that this is someone you may want to hire?
Upasna Gautam (53:31):
The whole point of the question is like, do you have and can you exhibit high agency? And especially again, working in news it's so important. And so there's not like a specific answer, I think the ability to actually define something specific and tangible in itself is a really, really, really good sign. I think a lot of people definitely get startled by that question sometimes, because it requires you to kind of have to know what it is that you put on the table, right? So yeah, it's different every single time. But if they can define something out of that question, it's usually a positive sign.
Lenny (54:15):
Cool, thanks for sharing that additional detail. Next question, what's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process at CNN or on your team specifically that's had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute?
Upasna Gautam (54:29):
Bridging the gap between product and editorial, that mutual trust and respect has had an outsized impact on our success as a high-performing team.
Lenny (54:38):
Sadly not something other people can use, but that's cool to know. Then we'll have to hire some journalists now, I think, to take advantage of that learning.
Upasna Gautam (54:46):
I can add onto that to make it relevant for others-
Lenny (54:50):
Sure.
Upasna Gautam (54:50):
... which is, it just goes back to, there's no substitute for having those direct conversations with your customers and your users. And it's like, when you understand that the assumptions you make are not one to one, or ever going to be one to one with their actual feedback. And developing that line of communication with your users and your customers is of utmost importance, I think that in itself is the key takeaway. It's like, how do you bridge the gap between collecting that feedback, having those conversations. Like, how far are you from your users, how frequently are you having conversations, how consistently are you having conversations? And I always think the more frequently and the more consistently, and earlier on in the process that you're having those conversations, the better.
Lenny (55:44):
Final question, maybe you already answered this. What's the most crazy or most memorable story from working at CNN?
Upasna Gautam (55:51):
Every election season is absolutely crazy in the best way possible. It's incredible to see our democracy in action, and watch history unfold. And while that's happening, using the platform you had a direct hand in building, and it's never lost on me that my work impacts the world every single day. And on the crazy, frustrating, stressful days, that is what serves as my anchor.
Lenny (56:19):
Awesome. Plus, this was amazing, I learned how to brush my teeth more mindfully, about elections, downtime, Trump, all these things. Final two questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Upasna Gautam (56:34):
It's very easy to find me. Online I'm pretty active on Twitter and Instagram. I recently became an amateur content creator, so I share lots of stuff here and there on social. So any social platform... Well not any, only on Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram. So any of those three is good, and I always love to hear feedback on stuff that resonated and made sense, and the stuff that there are further questions on. Always love having conversations around that. So yeah, DMs are always open.
Lenny (57:10):
I know we'll link to this in the show notes, but just, what's your handle on these networks?
Upasna Gautam (57:12):
It's my first and last name, very creative. I thought about it all by myself.
Lenny (57:16):
Awesome. And then I don't know if you answered the second question, how can listeners be useful to you?
Upasna Gautam (57:21):
It's the feedback, right? Like I love to hear what you found valuable, what helped you, what's a tactic that you took away and employed that helped you, things that made sense, things that didn't make sense, what you'd like to hear more about, any specific topic that would be valuable to do a deeper dive on. All of those things are very valuable to me.
Lenny (57:42):
Amazing. Again, thank you for being here, and adios.

# Building a magical AI code editor used by over 1m developers in 4 months: Inside Windsurf

## Transcript

Varun Mohan (00:00:00):
A lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks away. We should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of existing product look dumb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:00:16):
I want the company to almost be like this dehydrated entity. Every hire is like a little bit of water, and we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Any other there skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:00:29):
The engineers are now able to produce more technology. The ROI of building technology has actually gone up. This actually means you hire more. The best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. You could be a force multiplier to your organization in ways in which they never even anticipated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
Today my guest is Varun Mohan. Varun is the co-founder and CEO of Windsurf, which has quickly become one of people's favorite AI coding tools, and is basically the main competitor to Cursor with over 1 million users four months in. In our conversation, Varun shares what makes Windsurf unique, why they decided to invest heavily in enterprise sales very early in their history, why agency is going to be the most important skill for engineers and product builders to build, also the story of how they started out as a GPU infrastructure company and realized there was a much bigger opportunity up the stack and the two pivots that got them to where they're today.

(00:01:20):
He also gives a live demo, advice for being successful at Windsurf, and so much more. There's so much to learn about where things are heading for engineers and product builders in general in this conversation. And I'm really excited to bring it to you.

(00:04:00):
Varun, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Varun Mohan (00:04:03):
Buddy, thanks for having me. A long time listener.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:05):
Oh, I really appreciate that. I'm so excited to have you here. I feel like just you guys have become this overnight success, which is definitely not an overnight success, but I feel like I've been hearing about Windsurf more and more as people's favorite AI tool. And I just don't think people know the story behind Windsurf, behind Codeium, the company that you built. So I thought it'd be good to maybe just start there and have you just briefly share the history of Codeium and how Windsurf emerged out of Codeium.

Varun Mohan (00:04:31):
Yeah. So the company was actually started close to four years ago. As you know, AI coding was not a thing four years ago. ChatGPT was not out four years ago. At the time, we actually started out building GPU virtualization and compiler software. Before this, I worked in autonomous vehicles. My co-founder, who I had known since middle school, worked on AR/VR at Meta. And for us, we believe deep learning would touch many, many industries. It wouldn't just touch autonomous vehicles. It would touch financial services, defense, healthcare. And we believe these applications were hard to build, these deep learning applications. So we made it possible for you to effectively run these complex applications on computers without GPUs, and we would handle all the complexity of being able to actually run the workload on the GPUs for you. And we were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:05:20):
And in the middle of 2022 rolled around and we had a couple million in revenue and we were managing upwards of 10,000 sort of GPUs. We had eight people. At the time, we were free cash flow positive. But I think what we felt was once these generative models started to get very good, we sort of felt a lot of what we built was not as valuable. And this was a very, very hard moment for us at the company. We were only eight people at the time, but we felt, "Hey, would people be training these very bespoke sentiment classifier models anymore that were very, very custom models? Or would they just ask GPT-N, is this a positive or a negative sentiment?" Probably it's going to be the latter, right? And in a world in which everyone was going to run generative AI models, why would an infrastructure company be a differentiator? Because everyone is going to run the same kind of infrastructure down the line.

(00:06:06):
So instead what we decided to do was we believe generative AI was almost going to be like the next internet. And in that case, what we should go out and do is build the next great apps like Google, like Amazon. And we vertically integrated and actually took our infrastructure, our inference infrastructure to go out and build Codeium at the time. And at that time, we were early adopters of GitHub Copilot and we thought the coding space was going to get tremendously disrupted in the next coming years. So we actually took our infrastructure, we ran our own models in massive scale. We even trained our own models.

(00:06:35):
In the very beginning it was very, very simple. It was purely an autocomplete model, which basically means that as the user was typing, we'd complete the next one or two or three or four lines of code. But we provided the product entirely for free in all the IDEs that developers coded. That meant to VSCode, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Vim, Emacs. And the reason why we were able to build it for free was because of our infrastructure background. We were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:07:04):
I guess very quickly after that, some large businesses also wanted to work with us. And we built out this enterprise motion to work with these large companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. And for them the bigger thing wasn't just, "Hey, could we autocomplete code or could we chat with the code base?" It was, "Could you offer us a secure offering that was also personalized to all the private data inside the company?" So we took our infrastructure and made it so that we invested a ton in making sure that we deeply understood these large companies code bases. And that's what we were working on until six months ago.

(00:07:33):
It's not that we've stopped working on that, but basically what we realized six months ago was we were getting limited by the IDEs that we were already working in. So VSCode, which is a very popular IDE, had a ceiling for the AI capabilities, we could showcase our users. And because of that, we decided to go out and fork VSCode and build our own IDE with some of these new agentic capabilities. And over time in the last couple of years, the model capabilities have also been growing exponentially year over year. And that's sort of where we are right now. I skipped a lot of pieces there, but that's what we're landed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:05):
There's so many interesting threads there. One is just, there's always this question of just where value will accrue in AI. And it's so interesting, you guys started almost at the bottom layer of infrastructure GPUs and then you went to what people call a GPT wrapper, not actually. So I guess any just lessons there, just thoughts on just where you think value will end up in this world of AI and the stack of AI tools?

Varun Mohan (00:08:28):
Maybe I can start by just saying one thing about startups that I think are really true, it's very unlikely the first thing that you believe you should go work on is going to be the right thing, which is a very hard thing to kind of wrangle with being a startup founder, right? You need to kind of be irrationally optimistic that what you're going to do is going to be differentially important. Because otherwise, why would you go out and do what you're doing? And if it's obvious, then a bigger company would've already done it, right?

(00:08:56):
But then you also need to be really, really realistic because most ideas that are, I guess, non-conventional are usually bad ideas, right? So it's this weird tightrope you need to kind of balance on top of where you're pushing for a future that you believe is true, but all the while you're getting new information. You need to kill the beliefs that you had. And if I were to start with the infrastructure piece, we first went in with the assumption that model architectures were going to be really, really heterogeneous.

(00:09:27):
Working from an autonomous vehicle background, there were many different types of model architectures out there. There were convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, sort of lighter neural nets with frustrum point networks. And there were maybe tens of architectures we were dealing with. And at that point we were like, the complexity of this is so high that it's very clear if someone offloaded the complexity, there would be a lot of value.

(00:09:50):
Fast-forward to the middle of 2023, everything looks like it's going to be a transformer. So now our hypotheses are just wrong. So at this point then, most of the value is probably not going to accrue at purely the, at least this is our belief, at the infrastructure layer. It's going to accrue somewhere else. Where is the layer that you can actually differentiate on? And we believe the application layer is a very, very deep layer to go out and differentiate on, right? What are the number of ways we can build better user experiences and better workflows for developers? We think there's effectively no ceiling on that, on how much better we can make the lives of developers basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
You touched on the second thread that I thought was really interesting here, is just how you guys pivoted from ideas that were working. You were making money, people loved it. You said you had millions of dollars of ARR revenue. And then you're just like, "No, we're going to completely change the business."

(00:10:36):
So the question there is, just like, what have you learned about knowing what to follow? And one thing I heard there that was really interesting is just once your assumptions change about that you built your idea on, it's time to think this idea and maybe try something else.

Varun Mohan (00:10:48):
I think the way we sort of think about this is even when we're working right now, we just accept that we're going to get a lot of things wrong. We're just going to get a lot of things wrong. Obviously that's a very big moment because that was a bet the company moment in the sense that we basically said, told our investors, "Hey, we're making money on this." We had already raised 28 million of capital and we were just like, "Hey, we're just going to pivot entirely from this." And we did that overnight. This wasn't this thing where we just said, "Hey, maybe a quarter, one or two quarters." Because one of the things we knew that's very important for startups is focus.

(00:11:20):
If you're trying to do another thing that you think is big and you're focused on something that you don't believe is valuable, you're guaranteed going to fail at the thing you think is going to be big. So that's a very obvious thing there. But I think once you go in with the assumption that a lot of your hypotheses are going to be wrong, but you will do the most concentrated work possible to go out and validate these hypotheses and you won't be in love with your ideas.

(00:11:41):
I think ideas, it's awesome when you have a great idea, but you should never be too in love with your ideas. And you have an organization that is very truth-seeking. I think a lot of people at the company have had their ideas tested over and over again. Even just building Windsurf. That is not a complete company pivot, but that's a big decision that we made at the company. You kind of need to make some bets. And sometimes you're wrong and sometimes you're right. But if you have an organization that comes out and you feel like morale is not going to be low if you made the wrong decision, that's the best, right? That means you have optionality for the rest of time.

(00:12:14):
And Lenny, one thing that I try to tell the company about this is, this year the total amount of engineering output we'll have is much larger than the engineering output we've had since the beginning of the company's creation 'till now. So that almost means every year is a new lease on life for us, right? It's almost a new way for us to test out an entirely new set of hypotheses. And maybe we were wrong about our original hypotheses in the first place. What makes us more smart than everyone else to be right more times than that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):
That's so empowering. It makes me think about... Uri Levine was on the podcast, co-founder of Waze, and he has this phrase that he wears on his shirt. His book is called this Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. And that feels like that's exactly what you're describing.

(00:12:59):
Okay, so let's talk about Windsurf. What's the simplest way for people to understand what is Windsurf?

Varun Mohan (00:13:04):
Yeah. So Windsurf is an IDE, right? It's an application to go out and build software and build applications. The crazy thing is a lot of people who use the product don't even probably know what an IDE is, which is crazy. And we'll get into that in a second.

(00:13:22):
But why did we go out and build Windsurf and what is Windsurf maybe? Why couldn't we have just done this on top of conventional IDEs like Visual Studio Code? So maybe just to get into this a little bit, as we saw that AI was getting more and more powerful, the way people go out and build technology, we thought the interface for that was going to change remarkably. It was not going to be a conventional pure text editor where the user is writing a handful of lines of code or most of the code and the IDE provides maybe some basic feedback on what the user is doing right or wrong. And the basic feedback could be, "Hey, there's a bug in your software or compiler error in your software." It could do much more, right? It could actually go out and modify large chunks of code.

(00:14:04):
One of the key pieces that we recognized was, with this new paradigm with AI, AI was probably going to write well over 90% of the software, in which case the role of a developer and what they're doing in the IDE is maybe reviewing code. Maybe it's actually a little bit different than what it is in the past. And we'll see this very soon with Windsurf. Maybe when you're using the product, actually a good chunk of the user's time is that you're reviewing what the AI is outputting. So we needed to build custom-review flows into the IDE to actually make it so that it was easier to actually go out and do that, right? Because the developer is not spending all their time writing code.

(00:14:38):
And this is the fundamental premise on why we built the product. We thought we were going to get limited a ton if we had very, very basic UI out there. And I'll give you even a simple example here. We have this auto-complete product that completes a handful of lines of code. Now we've actually launched this offering called Windsurf Tab that basically shows you refactors as well. And these refactors are almost inline refactors. And we were able to build a custom UI for that in Windsurf.

(00:15:03):
But in VSCode, because of the access to the APIs, we needed to dynamically generate images right alongside the user's cursor because we just didn't have access to the capabilities to showcase and edit properly. And what we realized is immediately by porting over to Windsurf, our acceptance rate tripled. Same ML models, it just tripled. So what that, I guess, gave us confidence in is yeah, you could argue technology is very important. And I think technology is very important. But if our users are getting very little value from the technology we're sort of building, you need to really clarify, "Maybe we do need to build a new surface and interface." And that's what Windsurf is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:39):
So the big bet you took there just to make this super clear, is you were initially working within existing IDEs that everyone was familiar with. And then it was like, "This isn't going to get us where we need to go. We're going to try to convince people to switch to something completely new because it's going to be so much better. It's our own IDE."

(00:15:56):
I think maybe people may not recognize just how risky that is, convincing engineers to use something completely new. That's a huge deal.

Varun Mohan (00:16:02):
Yeah, no, of course. And one of the key pieces, maybe Lenny, that would be important to share is a lot of our developers do use Visual Studio Code. But there are lots of people that write in languages like Java, sort of C++ and so on and so forth, and they might use the JetBrains family of IDEs that like IntelliJ. And for us, we are actually still committed to building on those platforms, right? We just felt though that one of the dominant IDEs, which was Visual Studio Code, was limiting the sort of user interface that we could give to our actual customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):
What is the current state of traction for Windsurf? You hear all these crazy numbers about all the competitors in your space. What can you share there for folks just to know?

Varun Mohan (00:16:43):
Yeah, so maybe a handful. We launched the product a bit over four months ago. And in that period of time, over a million developers have tried the product. And obviously we have many hundreds of thousands of monthly active users right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
I love how these days like, "oh, a million. Oh, no big deal." It's just the numbers are absurd these days. We're just getting used to just 100 million ARR here, million users in four months there. It's just like, "Oh, of course. How could you not have that?" But that's absurd. It's just like an insane time right now.

(00:17:12):
You touched on something that I wanted to get to later, but I may as well bring it up now, the question of just how engineering will change in the future. You throw out the stat that 90% of code is going to be written by AI in the future. Dario from Anthropic recently said the same thing. You guys have a really interesting glimpse into just how things will look in the future.

(00:17:31):
So I guess the question is just, how do you think coding specifically will look in the next few years, how different will it be from today?

Varun Mohan (00:17:39):
I think when we think about what is an engineer actually doing, it probably falls into three buckets, right? What should I solve for? How should I solve it? And then solving it. I guess everyone who's working in this space is probably increasingly convinced that solving it, which is just the pure, "I know how I'm going to do it" and just going and doing it. AI is going to handle vast majority, if not all of it. In fact, it probably actually, with some of the work that we've done in terms of deeply understanding code bases, how should I solve it is also going to get closer and closer to getting done. If you deeply understand the environment inside an organization, if you deeply understand the code base, how you should solve it, given best practices when the company also gets solved.

(00:18:19):
So I think what engineering kind of goes to is actually what you wanted engineers to do in the first place, which is, what are the most important business problems that we do need to solve? What are the most important capabilities that we need our application, our product to have? And actually going and prioritizing those and actually going and making the right technical decisions to go out and doing it. And I think that's where engineering is probably heading towards.

(00:18:40):
Now, does that mean that no one needs a CS degree? I think that's maybe a little bit overplayed a little bit just because maybe here's my argument for that. A lot of developers nowadays that build full stack applications, at least until a handful of years ago, they probably went to college and took an operating system course. And in theory, they're not really playing around with the operating system, like the kernel scheduler very frequently. But do those principles help them in understanding why their applications are slow? Do they help them in understanding why some design decisions are better than the other? Yeah, that makes them a much better engineer than another engineer. And I think that idea and the understanding of what's going on at the bottom will make a good engineer even better. But also at the same time, it empowers a bunch of people that never understood all of those things, how to actually build as well, which is another remarkable sort of thing that fell out through this whole process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I don't know if you have kids, but just say you had kids or you had niece or nephew going into college, let's say, would you suggest they do do computer science or would you suggest you're not going to have a good time if that's the career you choose right now?

Varun Mohan (00:19:47):
Yeah. Maybe I think back a little bit. So I went to MIT. A lot of us at the company went to MIT together on the engineering team. I think when I think about what we learned the most for engineering or computer science, it was not exactly like how do you write code. That is almost a given that you can write code after going to college. It's more like the principles of how you think about a problem and how you break it down and how you solve it in an interesting way.

(00:20:15):
So an example of a class that I really enjoyed was our distributed systems class. And there, you're kind of reading through literature and understanding how some design decisions were kind of made. And I think it's more like a problem solving kind of course and a major. It's a major of how you solve problems given some constraints of how computers today function, right? Like, here's the speed at which memory sort of operates. Here's the speed at which... Here's how much computation you can do in one cycle or one second. And based on that, you can make some trade-offs and solve a problem.

(00:20:45):
So I don't know if I would say that you shouldn't go get a computer science degree. I think computer science is almost synonymous with problem solving. In that case, I think it's pretty valuable. Is everything you learn in your computer science degree useful? I'd say a lot of things that I learned in my computer science degree are not useful. I'll give you an example. I took a parallel computing class in Julia. I don't think Julia is a very popular programming language anymore. Am I very sad that I took the class? No. The principles of parallel computing are still very useful, I would say, today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
So what I'm hearing is, skills that you still want to build, whether it's computer science or maybe some version of computer science, is kind of building the mental model of how computers and systems work.

Varun Mohan (00:21:12):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):
Parallel processing, memory, hard drives, internet, things like that. And then there's just problem solving skills, being able to solve interesting problems. Is there any other skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:21:37):
I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit undervalued is this kind of agency piece. And I think about this a lot, which is, you have a lot of people that could go through college and go through school and they're basically told exactly what to do on a P-set. They're given these very, very, I would say, well-defined paths that they need to take. I think maybe in society and just school, we don't prioritize how do you make sure you get people with real agency that want to build something, right? Their goal is not just to maybe graduate from college and then get a job at a big tech company where they're told exactly what to do or where to put the pixel for this one website. I think that's maybe a skill set that is undervalued just right now, probably in the last maybe 10 years or so. And I think that's going to be really, really important.

(00:22:27):
For a startup, obviously these are skills that we just look for. We look for people that are really high agency because we just recognize that by default, if we don't innovate and do crazy things, we're going to die. The company is just going to die. So we just look for this, right? But I would say for most software engineering jobs, that's probably not the case. Just think about big company X and what they're hiring for on the average software engineering interview. It probably doesn't look like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:52):
I love how you phrased that. If we don't do crazy things and innovate, we're going to die. That would be a great title for this podcast episode. And I think, I know, it's 100% true. There's just a lot of crazy things happening and a lot of innovation happening. And if you can't keep up, you'll die.

(00:23:07):
So let's talk about hiring. You have a really interesting approach to hiring. There's a few questions I have here. One is just how do you... I know you try to stay really lean. That's a common theme across all the AI startups these days. How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:23:22):
I love the idea of being a lean company, but I don't idolize it in the way that, "Hey, it is a dream to be a 10% or 20% company that's making 50, 100, 200 million in revenue." That's not, I think, what we idolize inside the company.

(00:23:36):
I think what we idolize is, be the smallest company we can be to satisfy our ambitions. That's what the goal is. And maybe, Lenny, the way I would sort of put that out there is, if I told you, "Hey, I'm going to build an autonomous vehicle," and I said our team is 10 people, you should rightfully say, "Hey Varun, you're not serious. And you'd be right. I'm not serious at that point. So I think the answer is, what is the minimum number of people to go out and build the crazy ambition project that you have?

(00:24:04):
And I think the project we are trying to go out and do, which is completely transform the way software gets built, we've mentioned this [inaudible 00:24:11] the company, our goal is to reduce the time it takes to build apps and technology by 99%, right? It is a tremendously sort of ambitious goal. And it's not possible for us to be a 10, 20, 30, 40 person engineering team in the long term and actually satisfy that goal. We think there's a very, very high ceiling. So that's maybe the first key piece there. It's like, if we can crack actually being a fairly sizable company but still operate as if we're a startup, that's the dream. That's the dream.

(00:24:40):
In terms of hiring philosophy, the way we sort of think about things is, we only hire for a role if we're actually underwater for that function. So let's say we're going out and building inference technology. Unless we're underwater there, we will not go out and hire someone to go out and work for that. And the reason for that is, I actually think this is a feature. When you hire for a role and you already have enough people there, you get a lot of weird politics that ultimately ends up happening. And it's not because people are bad people. I think most people are really well-intentioned. But what happens when you have people that join a company and in reality you didn't really need them? They will go out and manufacture some other thing that they should go work on. They will go out and figure out something else to work on. And realistically, it's not that important, but they will go out and try to convince the rest of the organization that it is important.

(00:25:30):
I just think as a startup, we don't have the bandwidth to go out and deal with that, right? For me, I would like to see everyone just almost be raising their hands up being like, "I'm dying. We need one more person." And that's when we go out and hire someone. And one of the analogies I like to give is, I want the company to almost be this dehydrated entity and every hire is like a little bit of water. And we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):
I love this metaphor so much. And it sounds painful. It sounds painful that you need to be underwater and raising your hand, "I'm about to die and dehydrated." But I also know that it's a really exciting way to work. It sounds hard, but if you're in it, it's just like... I guess talk about just that side of it because I think it could sound like, "This is terrible. I don't want to work this way."

Varun Mohan (00:26:19):
You know what I actually think, Lenny? It's really good for a handful of reasons, which is that a lot of the... We respect and trust the people that work at the company. So this forces ruthless prioritization. You have a team that's going out and doing something. They will never ask to work on something that's not important. In fact, if there are two things that they're working on, they're just going to just tell me, "Hey, there are two things on my plate. I just don't have the ability to do two. I can only do one." And they will pick the one that's most important.

(00:26:45):
And this actually goes back to one thing that I think is true about startups and just companies in general. You don't win by doing 10 things well. You win by doing one thing really well and maybe you fail nine things. This is the thing that I've told the company, "This is very different than school," right? In school you optimize for your total GPA. But for companies, I just need to get an A+ on the one class that matters. And then I can get an F in all the other classes. And an F in all the other classes doesn't mean just doing illegal things. That basically means you just deprioritize things that don't matter. That actually forces this organizational prioritization that is just really, really good.

(00:27:22):
And Douglas and I, Douglas being my co-founder, we can tell the company, "These are the two things that are the most important." But if we go out and tell these are the two things that are the most important to the company and then we put the company has 20% more people than necessary, what's going to ultimately happen? It's almost a forcing function for ruthless prioritization to have fewer people or people that are just underwater internally at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:46):
Everyone listening that works at a big company knows exactly what you mean when you described when there's just too many people, they will all find work to do and they will all be pitching ideas. They all want to show impact, they want to do well in their performance reviews. That's just the nature of too many people at a company. And so I think this all really resonates.

(00:28:04):
To even getting even deeper on just what it looks like when someone's underwater to tell you it's time to hire, is it just someone coming to you, "Varun, I need someone on this team. This is just not possible"? What does that look like even more practically?

Varun Mohan (00:28:16):
Yeah, I think it's basically along those lines. It's that, "Hey, there's some pressure to get something done in a short period of time." By the way, one of the things that we do believe though for software, if you want to do great things, it's not possible to just say, "Hey, I want to get it done in one month" if it is like... Because you have to think about it from this perspective. If a software project could get built in two to three weeks, what does that really mean about the true complexity and differentiation of what you built? It's probably not very high, unless you believe you are way smarter than everyone else. But I think that's hubris, right? I think we actually have a very exceptional engineering team. But also at the same time, I don't think our engineering team is so exceptional that we can do things in three weeks that the rest of the world can't do in six to nine months. That's kind of stupid to believe that.

(00:28:57):
So I think basically it comes down to that person coming out and being like, "Hey, look, I don't have enough time to do X." Us having a conversation to be like, "Okay, what can you do then?" And if the answer is, "I can only do less than that," then maybe we make a decision actually, "Oh wow, that's great. Maybe we actually should deprioritize Y." Because this is actually also another thing that's very hard even for people like me and my co-founder. It's that we also want to do a lot of things. There's an urge to do a lot of things. But if we are forced to make a decision constantly on like, "We cannot do X," it's very clarifying. It's very clarifying because our engineering interview process is also extremely low acceptance rate. So it's not very easy for us to very quickly spin up people and have them join the company really, really quickly either.

(00:29:43):
So I think it's clarifying for everyone. It's clarifying for the person that wants more people. We can just tell them, "Hey look, we don't believe you should be doing this other thing." And it's also clarifying for us because we can also get on the same page with them. And sometimes we just kind of agree, "Hey..." Our teams are very flexible that, "Hey, actually we do need to get something done." And one of the things that we've kind of tried to make sure is true on our engineering team is, people's value to the company does not have anything to do with the size of their team. There are projects inside the company, there are directly responsible individuals for these projects inside the company. And if we feel like one project is very important, then people can move from one project to the next.

(00:30:21):
There's no notion of someone owning people at the company. That is a very bad and gnarly idea. In fact, the person that is the most valuable at the company is the person that can do the most crazy sort of project out there with as few people as possible. And that's what you should be rewarding internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
How many people do you have at coding at this point?

Varun Mohan (00:30:37):
So we have close to 160 people and the engineering team is over 50 people right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
Awesome. Oh, what's the other bigger functions? So [inaudible 00:30:46]-

Varun Mohan (00:30:46):
We have go-to-market. We have a... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):
Oh, right. Okay. I want to talk about that, the sales learning that you guys had. Okay. But let's close out this hiring conversation. So we talked about what you look for... To tell you it's the time to hire, what do you look for in the people that you interview and hire?

Varun Mohan (00:31:01):
One of the key pieces that we look for, we have a very high technical bar. So assuming that they actually meet the technical bar, I think we sort of look for people that are really, really passionate about the mission of what we're actually trying to solve and people that are willing to work very hard. I think one of the things that we don't try to do is convince people, "Hey look, we are a very chill company and it's great to work here." I think, no, this is a very exciting space. It's very competitive. You should expect us to lose if the people at the company are not kind of... They're not working very hard. And I think one of the biggest dog whistles I hear is, when I ask people how hard are you willing to work, some people actually ultimately say, "Hey, I work very smart." And I basically ask them a question, "If we have many smart people at our company that also work hard, what's the differentiator going to be? Are you just going to pull them down?"

(00:31:48):
Because I think one of the things that's true about companies is it's like this massive group project. And I think the thing about a person that is not pulling their weight that's bad. It's not the productivity, right? At some point when the company becomes many hundreds of engineers, I'm not going to be thinking about the one engineer that's not pulling their weight. It's the team of people they work with that are almost basically saying, "Is this the bar internally at the company? Is this the expectation?" And I guess, Lenny, if I told you you have a team of five people and the four other people you're working with just don't care, how much are you going to feel like you should care?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:21):
Not too much.

Varun Mohan (00:32:22):
Exactly. So for us, I think that's what we more care about. We have a culture where it's very collaborative. It's not an individual sport, but people feel like they can rely on other people to get complex sort of tasks done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:35):
So the question you asked there just basically is, how hard are you willing to work? How hard do you want to work? And I know some people, there's this whole group of folks that are just like work-life balance, "How dare you ask me to work crazy hours?" And I love just the filter upfront of, "If you work here, you will work really hard. You'll work a lot of hours. It's a crazy space to be in. And we will win by working smart and also really hard."

Varun Mohan (00:33:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
You said at some point earlier that your engineering pass rate, as you said, it was like 0.6% of candidates, something like that.

Varun Mohan (00:33:10):
Yeah, it's probably post or take home. It's probably that actually. So the take home itself filters probably another 10, 15X on top of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
Here's a question that I've been hearing more and more, is just, how do you do interviews these days with tools like Windsurf out there that solve all your problems?

Varun Mohan (00:33:25):
We are okay with people using the tools because I think one of the worst things is like, if someone comes here and doesn't like using these tools, we believe there are massive productivity improvements. We do bring people into the company on site so we can actually see how they think through problems on a whiteboard and all these other pieces. So we do want to see how they think on their feet and hopefully they're not just taking what we're saying, putting it in a voice translator and sticking it into ChatGPT and getting the answer out.

(00:33:51):
So there is a way to do this. My viewpoint on this is the tools are really, really important, but I do think we still look for some problem solving ability. If the only way you can solve a hard problem is put it into ChatGPT, I think that's a concern to us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:34:22):
Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab.

(00:34:54):

(00:35:24):
Okay. Let's talk about this go-to-market sales experience that you guys had. So you started obviously like most people, started building without sales team. And then you realized, from what I hear, that that was a huge miss and a big opportunity to talk about there because that's really unique, I think, that you guys have a large sales team and go-to-market team.

Varun Mohan (00:35:40):
Yeah, we actually made this decision pretty early in the company's history, I would say. We hired our VP of sales over a year ago actually. And the go-to-market team is now over 80 people inside the company. So it's a pretty sizable function inside the company.

(00:35:55):
Yeah. Maybe a little bit of a backstory here. So when we started the company, actually we had a handful of angels that actually were operators, go-to-market operators. So an example of one was Carlos Delatorre who used to be the CRO of MongoDB. And I think for us, we never viewed enterprise sales and sales as a very negative thing. I think this is a interesting thing that technical founders sometimes don't really like. They think sales is a very negative part of the process. Everything should be product-led growth. I think it's not that black and white. I think enterprise sales is really valuable. But maybe when we were a GPU virtualization company and we were an infrastructure company, the reason why we never hired a salesperson is, I didn't know how to scale the function. I was the one who was selling the product.

(00:36:37):
So ultimately speaking, if it was hard for me to sell the product incrementally, I didn't know how we could make that into a process that we could then go and scale. I didn't know how we could take the revenue of the business from a couple million to hundreds of millions and let alone even tenths. So if I didn't know how to do that, how could I go out and hire someone and make them scale it out?

(00:36:58):
On the other hand, for Codeium, very quickly, a lot of large enterprises reached out to us. And from that alone in the middle of 2023, we started, I guess, me and a handful of other folks at the company started selling the product and we were doing tens of pilots concurrently with large enterprises and we were very quickly able to understand that there was a large enterprise motion that needed to be built in this space. So by the end of 2023, we actually hired our VP of sales. And very quickly after that, scaled our sales team. Yeah, I mean look, if you want to sell to the Fortune 500, it is very hard to do that purely by swiping a credit card.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
Let's talk about Cursor. I don't want to spend too much time with competitors, but that's what everyone's always thinking about when they think of you guys. You guys are kind of the leading players, I think, in the space also. There's Copilot, but that's different.

(00:37:46):
So what's the simplest way to understand how you guys are different from Cursor and also just how you think you win in the space long-term?

Varun Mohan (00:37:53):
So I think maybe a handful of things that I could share. So on the product side, I think we've invested a lot in making sure code-based understanding for very large code bases is really high quality. And that's just because of where we started. We worked with some of the worlds are just companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. Companies like Dell have singular code bases that are over 100 million lines of code. So being able to understand that really, really quickly to make large scale changes is something that we've spent a lot of time doing. And that requires us actually building our own models that can consume large chunks of their code base in parallel across thousands of GPUs and almost rank them to be able to find out what the most important snippets of code are for any question that are asked about the code base. So we've gone out and built large distributed systems based on our infrastructure background to go ahead and do that. That's maybe one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):
Let me actually follow that thread because I think people may underestimate just how big of a deal that is. So when we talk about, we had the founders of Bolt and Lovable on the podcast, so those products, they build something from scratch, they built, they write the code for you. So that versus just loading, say, Windsurf on your million line code base, say, at Airbnb or Uber. Like, understanding what the hell you have and how it works and where to go change things without breaking it is insanely hard. And so what I'm hearing is that's kind of a big differentiator as you guys started there actually. And then Windsurf is now building up that advantage.

Varun Mohan (00:39:15):
That's right. Yeah. So that's a big thing that we spent a lot of time on, which is just understanding what the code base is doing. And actually one of the other things is, what are all the user interactions with respect to the code base? And happy to show that also in a bit here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Awesome.

Varun Mohan (00:39:31):
The second key piece probably is we're not only tied to Windsurf actually. This is probably a weird statement given even we are talking about Windsurf, which is that actually we're pretty focused on supporting IDEs like JetBrains. JetBrains or IntelliJ has over 70 to 80% of all Java developers coding in JetBrains based IDEs, right? The reason why we don't feel as big a need to almost build a competing product to JetBrains is JetBrains is actually a very sort of extensible product in a way that VSCode is not. VSCode is not very extensible.

(00:40:05):
So I think for us, our goal here is not only just to satisfy a subset of users that can actually switch onto our IDE, but we want to give this agentic sort of experience to every sort of developer out there. And if that means there are Java developers that write in JetBrains, that's fine. We work with a lot of large enterprises that have 10 plus thousand developers where over 50% of the developers are on JetBrains. It's a very large product. And by the way, that company itself is a privately held company that makes many hundreds of millions of dollars a year. So it's a very, very large company. So for us, that's another key piece. We actually want to meet developers sort of where they are. And if they use a different platform, we'll work on that too.

(00:40:42):
The third key piece, and this probably sounds another key piece for enterprises, is we work in a lot of very secure environments. We have FedRAMP compliance, which means we can sell to very large government entities. We have a hybrid mode of actually using the product, which means that all the code that lives that is indexed, it actually lives on the tenant of the user, right? Code is one of the most important pieces of IP for the company. So I think just if you were to look at it from a big company perspective, there are many reasons why over the years of just building an enterprise product, we've handled a lot of complexities that large companies want to see. But that's part of it is because of the history of how we got here in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
Okay, Varun, enough teasing. Let's do a live demo of Windsurf so folks can see what it's like. And then I'm just going to ask you a bunch of questions as we're going through it. So I'll let you pull up a little shared screen where you have Windsurf pulled up.

Varun Mohan (00:41:33):
Great. So some context, this is a very basic React project. There's nothing in it right now. So if you were to open any sort of file, it's the default React app project. I have this basic image here. You can pass Windsurf images of what you'd like the project to look like, of what I would like an Airbnb for dog's website to kind of look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:55):
Beautiful. Beautiful mock-up by the way. I love that this is like all you need.

Varun Mohan (00:41:59):
This is all you need. This is all you need. So basically what we're going to do is we're going to say, "Hey..." One of the cool parts about Windsurf is it can actually work in an existing project already. So I can basically say, "Hey, change this React app to show an Airbnb for dog's website based on this image and preview it."

(00:42:25):
So now it'll just go out and start executing code, reading through the repository. Obviously, it doesn't know what the current code base actually looks like. And it'll go out and analyze the code base to actually find out the set of changes necessary. So we'll go out and wait and see what it's going to do. But while we're doing that, let's continue the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
Awesome. Okay, so first of all, so you open up Windsurf. You had a boilerplate React project ready to go. And Windsurf had never really seen this code before. You ask it to do stuff on your code base, which is just like, "Change this to Airbnb for dogs using this design." Amazing.

Varun Mohan (00:43:03):
That's right. That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Yeah. Okay, cool. So we'll let it run and we'll talk. Let me ask you this question that I've been asking everyone that comes on that is building a product that helps engineers build products and product managers build products and designers.

(00:43:15):
Say you could sit next to every single new user that opens up Windsurf and whisper a couple tips in their ear to help them be successful with the product. What would be a couple tips you'd share?

Varun Mohan (00:43:25):
Tip number one is just be a little bit patient and both patient and explicit. When you ask the application to go out and make some changes, it could actually go out and make many irrelevant changes. One of the things that I think prevents this the most is just be really, really explicit or as explicit as possible. And one of the things I ask people to do is in the beginning, start by making smaller changes. If there's a very large directory, don't go out and make it refactor the entire directory because then if it's wrong, it's going to basically it destroy 20 files.

(00:44:00):
And I think from there, one of the key pieces I think that comes from the users that use the product is they sort of learn what the hills and valleys of the product are. The analogy I like to give are kind of similar to autocomplete. When you use a product like autocomplete, you would think a product that is suggesting things but only getting accepted 30% of the time would be really, really annoying. But the reason why it's not very annoying is actually because you've actually learned that, hey, 70% of the time, I don't need to accept this. And the times that I do, I know to get value from it. And you also know beforehand if a sort of command that you write is very complex, you just expect, "Hey, the autocomplete is not going to work for it." So I think it's almost like a, understand what the hills and valleys of the product are.

(00:44:45):
The crazy thing is, every three months that kind of gets changed and reevaluated. It almost becomes the case that it becomes materially better than it was in the past. So I think maybe patience and being explicit are maybe the two important key pieces I would tell users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):
And I think something that was kind of between the lines there is get a gut feeling of what the model is capable of, like how specific to be versus how abstract it can be. And there's kind of this gut feeling you start to build over time.

Varun Mohan (00:45:12):
That's right. Yeah. And with that, it feels like we have an actual preview. Guess what? We have a nice-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
Cute dogs.

Varun Mohan (00:45:21):
A nice dog app. And one of the cool parts is that we've also done beyond just modifying code is actually being able to point to different pieces. And I guess I could just kind of say... I could point to different elements and say, "Hey, make the background..." This is not great design, but I could basically say, if I took this element, "Make this background red and just take a particular element and just change it and make it red." And it should go out and be able to go out and do this.

(00:45:52):
The preview aspect of the product of being able to showcase the app while it's getting built helps in that, now actually you can live entirely in app world. You don't even maybe even need to look at the code. Granted this looks hideous, but in some ways if I wanted to, I could go out and do that, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:09):
This is what happens when there's no more designers. Like, [inaudible 00:46:11].

Varun Mohan (00:46:11):
Yeah. When there's no more designers. Sure. Maybe the answer is like, when you ask me what should people be doing, they should study great taste. Having great taste. Because I think taste is also a very, very hard, right?

(00:46:22):
But maybe the other key piece, Lenny, that I wanted to showcase here is obviously you could keep going here. I could take different components and kind of change them. We have a lot of plans here that are beyond just point and click changing components. But one of the cool pieces is the AI. There's an AI review flow as well, which is kind of like what I was saying. The goal of AI has now changed a lot in that it is now modifying large chunks of code for you. And the job of a developer now is to actually review a lot of the code that the AI has generated. And granted right now during this podcast, I'm not going to review all the code that's getting generated.

(00:46:57):
But let's say I want to go out and modify some of this code. And this is where if you're an actual developer that actually wants to go modify, maybe I don't like my variable name being called title. I want it to be called Title String instead, like this. And if I wanted to go out and make that change and change to go out and say Title String and that's what I'm going to do, I'm just going to tell the AI to continue.

(00:47:18):
The cool part about this is Windsurf not only knows about what the agent has done. It also knows everything that the user has done. Our goal here is to have this almost flow-like state where everything the user has done, the AI also knows. And it is able to predict the intent. And as you can see, it said, "I noticed that the interface property title was changed to Title String." And then it now has gone out and modified all the locations within the app from title to Title String. And now it no longer says that.

(00:47:45):
So this is where even if I'm writing software and I want to go and make point changes, the AI can go out and quickly make these changes on the user's path. Imagine doing a refactor or a migration and you just change one part of the code. You can just tell the AI to continue the rest. And because it deeply understands the code base, it should go out and find all the corresponding places to go out and make the change. And obviously now when I reload my app, there's no bug in the app. It still loads properly. I could obviously tell it to do even cooler things like make the app retro. I don't know what that means, but I guess I could do that. And it should go out and make the change correspondingly for me.

(00:48:23):
But yeah, that's maybe the high level parts there where the AI is not only able to operate entirely in app space but also on the code space of the users going out and modifying code and to bridge the gap between the two. So it should add leverage not only non-developers that are just purely building apps, but also developers that are just hands-on keyboard too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):
Amazing. By the way, if you're not on YouTube, you can't see, but you can just select any element of the page and then reference that in your ask of, "Here's what I want changed." I didn't know that was a feature. And that is extremely cool.

(00:48:57):
So interestingly, so having just looked at Lovable and Bolt and Replit and apps like that, it's basically doing all the things those apps do. Oh, wow. There's the retro version. That's good. I like that it built on your red and made it really nice actually.

Varun Mohan (00:49:11):
Actually the red looks way better now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):
Yeah, a little green button. This is great. Okay.

Varun Mohan (00:49:14):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
So I don't think people realize this, but apps like Windsurf, that it could actually do a lot of agentic work for you where you just tell it, "Here. I want you to do this" versus it's auto completing code for you.

(00:49:25):
The big difference is you need to start it with some code base so you have this kind of boilerplate React project. Is there a reason you guys aren't taking that step and just doing that automatically for you? Is it because you're targeting engineers and they don't need that or is there other reasons?

Varun Mohan (00:49:39):
Lenny, the interesting thing is the base app that you saw for this was also generated by Windsurf. The reason why we sort of didn't generate it is installing all the dependencies takes like three or four minutes. And for the demo, I didn't want to wait. But totally, actually most of the users of the product, probably zero-to-one build these apps.

(00:49:57):
And if I can say one interesting thing is, when we launched Windsurf, actually we tasked everyone at our company to go out and build an app with Windsurf. That included our go-to market team and our sales team. There was a crazy stat that I think people would find surprising, but we've saved over half a million dollars of SaaS products we were going to buy because our go-to-market team has now built apps instead of buying them. Our head of partnerships, instead of buying a partner portal product, has actually built its own partner portal. He had never built software in the past. We've actually come up with ways inside the company to deploy these apps easily in a secure way. And we're actually now building very, very custom software for our company to operate more efficiently, which is, I would not have expected this probably six months ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:44):
That is incredibly interesting. You don't need to name company names, but I guess what's a space you're least bullish on that you think is going to have the most problem here with people building their own version of these sorts of products?

Varun Mohan (00:50:56):
I think maybe my viewpoint are these very, very verticalized niche products I think are going to get... They're going to get competed down a ton. And I think sales products are an example of one of these things. And maybe this is a... I don't want to be very negative, but it's very hard inside a company like ours to task our best engineers to build a best in class sales product. There's not enough interest to do that. Or to build a best in class legal software product or finance software product. It's very, very hard for us to. And actually that's a very big moat for these companies that built these products that they were able to come out, have an opinionated stance on how to do this, hire good enough engineers to go out and build the software. Our company is unwilling to do that. So previously, we would go out and buy the technology because there would be no alternative.

(00:51:48):
But now one of the crazy things is that the domain specialists now have access to build the tools that they ultimately wanted, which is actually crazy. If you think about why were these software companies able to exist these vertical software companies, the reason is because they had many features. The kitchen sink of features worked for a lot of companies, but each individual company only wanted 10% of the features. But the problem is, each individual company was not capable of maintaining a piece of software or building the custom piece of software for 10% of the features, but that has now changed entirely. Now they can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:22):
Yeah. There's always been a story of like, "Why would I spend any time building my own software if I could just..." But now it's like five minutes of time.

Varun Mohan (00:52:29):
Five minutes and maybe even more custom to your system. How many times have you bought a software and you're almost like, "Why is there no integration to X? And I actually use X." How annoying is that? That actually makes the software less useful to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):
So I think what's cool is when you go back, if someone zooms back to the beginning of when you started the demo, it's basically a PM talking to an engineer, "Hey, build me a Airbnb for dogs. Here's a stupid mock that I made with some boxes." That's almost like a bad PM talking to an engineer and it just actually works. That's what's insane about this. And so that's why this example you're sharing of go-to-market folks, building their own things, it's like they don't need to know anything about product building. It's just describe it in some ridiculous way and draw a couple boxes of what you want it to look like and it makes something for you.

Varun Mohan (00:53:20):
Which shows that agency is what matters. If you have a product manager that has an idea, there's no reason for why that idea cannot be more well fleshed out. How many times do you have a product manager that just continualize ideas, but it just feels like they are extremely unsure on how to execute on it? They just want to say things for sake of saying things? But for the people that have ideas and a lot of, I guess, agency, they can go out and prove out what they want without any sort of external resources.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):
I think even more acutely for product folks listening to this, it's the salesperson coming to you being like, "Hey, I want this thing. It's going to help me with my sales team." And you're like, "I don't have a million things to build. I don't have time for this." And so that problem goes away, which I think will make a lot of product leaders really happy.

(00:54:04):
The model that this is sitting on, is it Sonnet?

Varun Mohan (00:54:08):
Yeah. So just to break down how it ultimately works, we have a model that does planning. And I would say right now Sonnet is a really, really good planning model. I think OpenAI's GPT-4o is also good. But the crazy thing is what we try to do is we try to make the Anthropic based model or Sonnet model try to do as much of the high level planning as possible. And then what we try to do internally is run all the models necessary to do high quality retrieval for the agent. As you could see, the agent needed to understand what the rest of the code base ultimately did. We actually make sure we run models to actually chunk up the entire code base and understand the code base so that obviously it would not be a good idea if we had a 100 million line code base to send that entire code base to Anthropic.

(00:54:49):
First of all, you couldn't do that. That's over 1.5 billion tokens of code. So obviously that would be three or four orders of my actually larger than the largest context lens right now.

(00:54:58):
But you also wouldn't want to do that from a cost and latency standpoint too. So that's one. And the second piece that you saw was the model is able to very quickly make edits to the software as well. We have custom models that we built that are post trained on top of popular open source models that can make these edits really, really quickly to the code base. And the reason why you would want to do that is it's A, faster, and B, also that model can actually have more of the code base in context too. So it can be better at applying changes than even Anthropics model too.

(00:55:28):
So I think the way we like to think about it is, our only goal is how do we build the best product possible? How do we build the best product possible and how do we make the ceiling as high as possible? And we will go out and build models and train models wherever necessary. But if we're not going to be good at a task and we think the open source is better or Anthropic's better, we'll go and just use the open source or Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):
And so the models you guys are building, those are built on open source models that people are releasing?

Varun Mohan (00:55:51):
Yeah. Interestingly, the one that does retrieval is actually completely pre-trained in-house that actually does that. But yeah, for a lot of different pieces, it's based on open source. Interestingly for the one that does the edits and auto-complete, that is also in-house. As you're typing, we actually do some auto-complete related stuff. I'm happy to show that, but I think a lot of users are familiar with that capability. So I think the way we like to look at it is like, what could we be best at and we will go out and trade. But if we're not going to be best at it, we should not just, for the sake of ego, go out and trade something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):
This may be getting too technical, but just, is there anything interesting around what you train on?

Varun Mohan (00:56:27):
Yeah, so one of the interesting things that we have from our users, and this is where we try to think like, "Why would we be any better?" is that, actually every hour, we get probably tens of millions of pieces of feedback from our users. We get a lot of feedback on what they like and what they don't like. For something like autocomplete, we get a lot of preference data, a lot of preference data. And the preference data is weird. It doesn't look like data that you find on the internet. It's like data as the user is typing. Imagine you're typing some code in a code base, the code's going to be incomplete as you're typing it, right? It's not going to be in a full-fledged form. It's not like it is on GitHub. But we have a lot of data that looks like this.

(00:57:06):
So we are uniquely well-positioned to actually build a good model that can complete code even when it's in an incomplete state when the models that are out there, the frontier models have consumed very little code that looks like this. So for that case we're like, "Hey, we can go out and do a much better job potentially." And we'll go out and train models on all the preference data we have.

(00:57:25):
The same is kind of true on retrieval, right? There's a way to find out, are we retrieving the right data? Did the user accept the code change after that? Was the retrieval actually a good retrieval a signal that we can get? So basically the way we like to look at it is, if something is just purely code planning, there's not a great reason why we would be the best at that. I can't come up with a coherent argument for that. But for something that looks more along the lines of, "Hey, here's an intermediate code base that is very gnarly and here are some changes that need to get made" and we know the evolution of the code or we've seen the evolution of code across millions of users, we feel like we can do a great job of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):
I think what's interesting about this is another differentiator/moat for companies that end up winning in this space, is you just have more and more of that data than other companies if you're ahead.

Varun Mohan (00:58:14):
Yeah. This is sort of why maybe at a high level we like the zero-to-one app building product space. I think it's really... It's a good product space. But ultimately I think it needs to boil down to you understanding the code, because otherwise, you're living at too high a plane where it's not clear why you would be able to be the best at that compared to everyone else. It's not really clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:35):
As a company, you mean?

Varun Mohan (00:58:36):
As a company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
Versus as a user.

Varun Mohan (00:58:37):
It feels like it might get competitive in a way that it's not clear where you would continue to differentiate over and over with time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
I see. Because if they're just sitting on top of Sonnet and just doing what every other Sonnet wrapper is doing, there's not a lot of differentiation or moat.

Varun Mohan (00:58:54):
It depends on how you do it. But maybe if I was to say this, if the inputs you're consuming are just web elements, extremely high level web elements, then the interface might be high level enough that it's hard to maybe get better than maybe what the frontier models are doing just across the board. You are just better off just plugging in Sonnet for everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
Got it. Awesome. One thing I wanted to come back to that I wrote down that I think is really important for people to understand, you talked about how with Windsurf it's not necessarily... There's a boilerplate code base that you want to start with because it's actually... Because it's not an abstracted zero-to-one app builder. It's an actual IDE you're coding in. And you talked about how has to install dependencies, which is kind this painful thing. And the reason it has to do that is because running locally on your machine versus in the cloud, like, say, Lovable and Replit and all these guys, although I think Bolt runs in your browser in this really cool way.

(00:59:47):
So that's an important distinction. This is like you're running this locally in your machine and has all the libraries you need to actually run it.

Varun Mohan (00:59:54):
No, I think that's important. I think we believe a lot of people sort of build software in what are called code spaces and things in a remote machine. I just think it's that a lot of developers like building locally for what you said. Like if you're doing things that are more than just full stack applications, you might have dependencies on your machine that are just system dependencies that are just gnarly to install. Let's imagine you're building a GPU-based application and the Nvidia drivers, they're necessary. You just want to give people the flexibility to build where they can build. And I think the IDE and building locally has been a thing that people have done for decades, so probably it's not going to go away in the next couple of years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):
I love that your sales folks now are running local host servers.

Varun Mohan (01:00:34):
Well, with the browser previews, it's easier, right? You kind of just open it up on the side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Okay. I have a few more questions just about how you think and operate at Codeium. So you guys are kind of at the forefront of how product teams are going to operate. You're seeing the future every day. And so I'm curious if there's ways you guys have structured your teams, engineers, product design that might be different from how other companies are doing it or have tried stuff that has worked really well or tried stuff that's a huge disaster?

Varun Mohan (01:01:02):
One interesting decision that we kind of have for core engineering is that we don't have pure product managers for the core engineering side of the company. And by the way, that's purely because we build for developers and our product is built by developers. So I think the intuition from our own developers is hopefully valuable. If not, we might be hiring the wrong type of people. So I think our developers are, in some sense, flexing to be more product conventional product managers.

(01:01:32):
Now on the other hand, if we were building something that looked more like Uber or the persona was very different and we didn't ourselves understand it, I think the organization wouldn't look the way it looks.

(01:01:42):
For the enterprise side of the company, because we do work with a lot of large enterprises where the requirements are not something that our engineers would automatically understand, I don't think our engineers wake up and they're like, "We need FedRAMP." This is probably something that a lot of customers come to us with and tell us. We have people that flex in this product strategy role that understand what the customer wants and understands the technical capabilities that we have to best build a product that would help them at scale.

(01:02:12):
So I think we have an interesting organization in this regard, but mostly I would say because we are a developer-based product, I would say that's true.

(01:02:21):
And then also kind of like what you said for the engineering team itself, the team structure is, it's fairly flat. We try to go with two pizza teams, teams that are fairly small just because I think the problem is when a team gets too big, the person leading the team is no longer able to get in the weeds of the technology itself. And I think in a space that's moving this quickly, I think it's dangerous to have leaders that don't understand the technology deeply and are not building. It's very, very dangerous because there's too much armchair quarterbacking. And so I think that's maybe one other decision we made.

(01:02:56):
And then teams are very, very flexible. So if we decide something is a new priority, we're very quick to change the way a team looks. And it's very centrally planned in this regard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:08):
The two pizza team concept, I saw a tweet long ago where someone from India, was like, there's always talk about two pizza teams, but pizzas in India are much smaller. And so the teams end up being smaller and they're like, "Why can't we build as much of these teams in the US?"

Varun Mohan (01:03:22):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:23):
Okay. So how many PMs do you have? So you said you have 150 employees, something like that?

Varun Mohan (01:03:28):
Yeah. So in terms of the product strategy function, we have three people in that role right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):
I see. So it's like product... They're in their titles is product strategy, not necessarily product management?

Varun Mohan (01:03:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
Interesting. And then 50 engineers, you said 80-ish sales folks?

Varun Mohan (01:03:45):
Yes, that's right. And then obviously we have functions like recruiting parts of G&A, like finance. We have marketing at the company. So some other functions internally as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):
It's interesting. And this is something that you hear all the time with companies like Dario for example, from Anthropic talking about how 90% of code is going to be written by AI. But all at the same time, all you guys are hiring engineers like crazy.

Varun Mohan (01:04:08):
Yeah. Is that contradictory?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):
It's that contradictory, will there be an inflection point of like, "All right. Now we don't need them anymore."

Varun Mohan (01:04:15):
I think it really comes down to, do you get incremental value by adding more engineers internally? I'm going to take... First of all, maybe just to set the record straight, if AI is writing over 90% of the code, that doesn't mean engineers are 10X as productive. Engineers spend more time than just writing code. The review code, test code, debug code, design code, deploy code, right? Navigate code. There's probably a lot of different things that engineers do. There's this one famous law in parallel computing, it's called Amdahl's Law. I don't know if you've heard about it. But it basically says if you have a graph of tasks and you have this critical path and you take any one task and parallelize it a ton, which is make it almost take zero amount of time, there's still a limit of the amount of how much faster it made the whole process go.

(01:04:56):
So maybe put simply, let's say you have 100 units of time and only 30 units of time is being spent writing software and I took the 30 and made it three, I only took the 100 and made it 73. It's only a 27% improvement in the grand scheme of things.

(01:05:09):
So I think look, we are definitely seeing over 30, maybe close to 40% productivity improvements. But I think for the vision that we're solving for, even if I were to say the company in the long tail had 200 engineers, it'd probably be too low still at that point. So the question is, how much more productivity do you get per person? Actually, maybe just to even say one of those thing for some of these large companies, let's say you took the CIO of a company like JPMorgan Chase, right? Her budget on software every year is $17 billion and there's over 50,000 engineers inside the company and you told her, "Hey, each of these engineers are now able to produce more technology." That's effectively what you've done, right? The right calculus that JPMorgan Chase or any of these companies will make is the ROI of building technology has actually gone up. So the opportunity cost of not investing more into technology has gone up, which means that you should just invest even more. And maybe in the short term you have even more engineers, right?

(01:06:08):
Now, that's not true across the board. There are some companies that are happy with the amount of technology they're building and there's a ceiling on the amount of technology they want to build. But for companies that actually have a very high technology ceiling, this doesn't mean you stop. This actually means you hire more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:22):
This is a great bull case for engineers. I feel like the canary in the coal mine for the engineering profession is when companies like yours slow down on hiring engineers.

Varun Mohan (01:06:30):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:31):
That's not happening.

Varun Mohan (01:06:32):
[inaudible 01:06:32]. It seems like Anthropic is also hiring a lot to get it done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:35):
Yeah. Everyone is. So I think that's really promising. I think if you're in college still, makes sense to get into engineering at this point.

(01:06:40):
Okay. Let me ask you this question as kind of a final question maybe. What's maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned about building AI products, building Windsurf and just being in a space?

Varun Mohan (01:06:54):
I think one of the weird things is online, everyone is very excited about the short-term wins that we are making, right? Like what we're putting out maybe weekly. We do these waves every couple of weeks. But actually a lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks, maybe three, six months, nine months away. That's what we're working on internally. Because I think this is kind of, Lenny, what I was mentioning to you before. One of the goals that I tell everyone at our company is we should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of our existing product look dumb.

(01:07:31):
So there's this weird tension where you want to have a product in market and you want to incrementally iterate and listen to users and keep making it better and better. But I would say we were the first identical IDE product out there. That's what we landed with. And I think the value of that is going to depreciate very quickly unless we continue to re-prove ourselves. And we will need to re-prove ourselves in ways in which our users are not even asking. So there's this tension here, where incremental feels very safe, right? Add this one more button. Users say, "Hey, I would like to be able to have this drop down to do X." But that is not the reason why we're going to win. That's almost table sticks. Yeah, we'll decide to do some of these. We might not decide to do a lot of these things. But it's these longer term efforts inside the company that almost disrupt the existing product that are ultimately the reason why we're going to succeed.

(01:08:21):
It's this weird tension that you need to have in your head of, you can't also not listen to your users at all because they're the reason you exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
This reminds me of a recent podcast guest. We had Gara from captions on the podcast and he told us that he has two roadmaps. They have two roadmaps at the company. They have the real roadmap, like the typical roadmap based on feature requests and user feedback and data and things like that. And then they have the secret roadmap, which is completely not informed by users or data/ it's just them making bets on where they think the world is going.

Varun Mohan (01:08:52):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
And I love that he calls it the secret roadmap just to make it very mysterious and-

Varun Mohan (01:08:56):
That's smarts. That's very smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:57):
Okay. I have one more question. I apologize. What's one thing that you wish he had known before starting Codeium?

Varun Mohan (01:09:04):
Honestly, I wish I had... Maybe humility is the wrong term, but this idea of just being okay with being wrong faster. I always think about things on when we make decisions. Me and my co-founder, we always talk about it. We're almost like, "Hey, I wish we had made the decision to do this a couple months earlier." We always talk about this. And the weird thing is outside looking and everyone's like, "Wow, actually the decision was made at the right time." But in my head I'm always banging my head being like, "What if we had made it a couple months earlier?" I think part of that is I waxed poetically about like, "Oh, you need to be irrationally optimistic and uncompromisingly realistic." But it's very hard to do this in practice because you drink your own Kool-Aid too. Because if you're not drinking your own, you won't get up out of bed. The answer is already solved. It's not actually any of these startups. The answer is Microsoft is going to be the winner in any software category. Isn't that the answer? Just because of distribution, resources and capital, they're going to commoditize every space.

(01:10:06):
So I think in some ways this amount of just understanding that, hey, re-evaluate your hypotheses and get into an uncomfortable space way more frequently is something I need to remind myself even to this day. And probably something that I didn't know coming in and starting the company. We started the company at peak zero time. At that time, probably everything seemed like it was going to moon. And there was probably a lot of irrational confidence, I would say, that we shouldn't have had.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Varun, we covered so much ground. What an incredible conversation. I learned so much just sitting here listening and asking you questions. Is there anything else that you wanted to share I leave listeners with, any last piece of nuggets or wisdom before I let you go?

Varun Mohan (01:10:51):
To be honest, I could give predictions about the space. Probably most of them are going to be wrong. I think the best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. And I think one of the most obvious things that's going to happen is, in the next year, there will be a tremendous amount of alpha for anyone that is able to take maximum advantage of these tools. Just imagine how many of your coworkers just don't even know the existence of these tools, don't know what they can do and how much less productive they will be. And I would just say get your hands as dirty as possible, as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:24):
And when you say get your hands dirty, basically it's like download Windsurf, start coding. Ask it to build things for you.

Varun Mohan (01:11:29):
Yeah, build apps. Build apps. Start using it for maybe even making mocks, modifying your existing code base. There's probably ways in which you could be a force multiplier to your organization and ways in which they never even anticipated, right? Imagine if you were a product manager that could actually very quickly make edits to the code base and just start pushing changes yourself. You probably get a tremendous amount of respect from your own engineering peers. You could probably get way more done because of that. I feel like there's no sort of ceiling at that point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
I think this is such an underestimated point you're making here. There's apps that can build things from scratch and then there's apps like this that can edit your existing code base if you're a PM at... What's the largest company you work with, people-wise?

Varun Mohan (01:12:15):
Publicly, let's just say JPMorgan Chase.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:16):
Okay.

Varun Mohan (01:12:19):
They have over 50,000 developers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
Okay. So you could be a PM at JPMorgan Chase and be like, "I have a problem I need to solve. I want to move this metric. I want to change the step in the signup flow." You just open up Windsurf and tell it to do the thing you want. And then can you push straight to GitHub and do a-

Varun Mohan (01:12:37):
Yeah. Actually, you could do that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
... merge [inaudible 01:12:39]-

Varun Mohan (01:12:39):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Okay. PR?

Varun Mohan (01:12:40):
Yeah, it could make a PR for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):
Oh, my God. This is insane. Folks, future is out of control. Okay. Man, that was such an important point at the end there because I think people may not realize this. They see all these other apps, they're like, "Oh, [inaudible 01:12:51], prototypes," but this is legitimately something a PM can actually do work with.

Varun Mohan (01:12:55):
Yeah. When you think about the people, at least that, I don't know, Lenny, who you respect the most, they're the people that somehow, despite their title, their level of agency and just output just all the way down to the weeds to the highest level strategy is just perfection, right? They know when to go all the way down. And I think sometimes you see people that talk about roles and they irrationally feel like, "Oh, because I'm this role, I'm not allowed to touch this." Well now everything's open season, right? And I think this is an opportunity to almost go all the way down to the weeds and all the way up to the top and just be effective on every level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):
Unbelievable. All right. Well with that, we'll leave folks. Varun, thank you so much for being here.

Varun Mohan (01:13:35):
Awesome. Thanks a lot, Lenny.

# An inside look at how Miro builds product | Varun Parmar (CPO of Miro)

## Transcript

Varun Parmar (00:00:00):
Every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you are either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Varun Parmar. Varun is chief product Officer at Miro, and prior to Miro, he was senior vice president and chief product officer at Box. As I share with Varun at the start of our chat, I've always been really curious about the product culture at Miro, partly because everyone I've ever met from Miro has been super interesting and super smart, and partly because they've been able to grow as a business and a product in an incredibly competitive market.

(00:01:07):
In our conversation, we get really deep into the product values and principles at Miro, their product development process, how Varun approaches competitive threats, how a bimonthly company-wide product demo ritual led to saving months of engineering work on a feature, plus insights into how Miro got started, how they grow today, and what their product team has learned about working with a large sales org. Varun is amazing, I learned a lot, and I hope you find it as interesting as I did. With that, I bring you Varun Parmar after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. While you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board.

(00:02:29):
With one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company and if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design and product for a fraction of the cost of agencies. Braintrust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70%, so you can make your budget go four times further.

(00:03:22):
Plus they're the only network that takes 0% of what the talent makes, so they're able to attract and retain the world's best tech talent. Take it from DoorDash, Airbnb, Plaid, and hundreds of other high growth startups that have shaved their hiring process from months to weeks at less than a quarter of the cost by hiring through Braintrust network of 20,000 high quality vetted candidates ready to work. Whether you're looking to fill in gaps, upskill your staff or build a team for that dream project that finally got funded, contact Braintrust and you'll get matched with three candidates in just 48 hours. Visit useBraintrust.com/lenny or find them in my show notes for today's episode. That's usebraintrust.com/lenny for when you need talent yesterday. Varun, welcome to the podcast.

Varun Parmar (00:04:10):
Thank you, Lenny. So excited to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:13):
I'm really excited to have you here. I've been looking forward to having a chance to dig into Miro's product culture and the way Miro works for a while. We've actually had a few guests, ex-Miro... Mironeers, is that what you call yourselves?

Varun Parmar (00:04:25):
Yes, Mironeers.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Okay. Mironeers. So we had Elena Verna on the podcast, who's amazing, and Barbara who I think worked in marketing and everyone I've always met from Miro has been just really smart and really interesting and it just feels like you guys have a really interesting product culture that I haven't felt like has been shared a lot, and so I have a bunch of stuff I want to dig into there. One question I have at the bat, you guys have a really interesting history and specifically the way your company's structured, which is that you're collocated in Amsterdam and San Francisco. First of all, is that correct?

Varun Parmar (00:05:00):
The company is a global company, so we've got 12 different hubs. We have multiple offices in US, four different offices, and then multiple hubs in Europe as well, and presence in AsiaPac as well. I think by now we have a global footprint, yeah.

Lenny (00:05:17):
Got it. A question I wanted to ask off the bat is just how has that cross-cultural approach to product teams impacted the way that you guys built product and the way the company operates?

Varun Parmar (00:05:30):
The one thing that's really interesting, Lenny, around the way Miro is set up is that our product organization is actually based in Europe and our go-to-market organization is worldwide. Our product management team, our designers, our engineers are located across three different hubs in Europe. What that sort of leads to is a couple of practices that we have as part of our culture. The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers and figuring out what customer pain points and problems we can solve, but given our distributed nature in terms of having a global footprint and a lot of our go to market teams, folks in sales and marketing and customer success are in different continents or geographies, we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally. When we are interacting with folks, let's say in San Francisco, and those folks are out there meeting some of our large customers and stuff, how do we, in the product organization, understand their perspective, and bring that perspective into how we design, prioritize and build products? I think that's one thing that's unique.

(00:06:43):
I would say the other thing that's less to do with the location, but I think is sort of the core cultural value or philosophy that Andre, who's the founder and CEO has instilled in all of us, is practicing teamwork, how do we actually come together as a team, and bring down the silos that might exist across functions? I'll talk a little bit around how we are structured in the product organization so that it's a cross-functional perspective we bring to everything that we're doing because we believe the best work happens when we bring different diverse perspectives to the problem and then co-create the outcome that the customer is looking for.

Lenny (00:07:20):
I want to pull on these threads actually real quick. You talked about this value of empathy and the importance of having empathy across... because you guys are located in different locations and have different cultures, and also this idea of teamwork. What's something that you've done that helps you do that, either build empathy and maintain empathy across teams or make sure that people work in teams and not like, "Hey, there's this other team over there doing something else"?

Varun Parmar (00:07:45):
One of the most powerful things that I've seen work is the questions that you ask, the questions that you ask when you're going through product review or you are going to sit down and talk to someone and trying to understand why did they prioritize something over the other and was it something that was done through interactions they've had with folks internally or externally? I think it's the set of questions to ask in terms of how did they get to where they are today and was it informed by understanding of the insights that collectively the organization has? Was it informed by their understanding of where the market is evolving, where the competition is going.

(00:08:31):
Was it informed through the series of insights they have, either through inbound feedback that's coming through our different channels where customers are giving feedback or some outbound interactions that they've had? I think just trying to double click and getting to the details in terms of what insight led them to recommend certain things or make a left turn or a right turn is where I think is the most powerful way to make sure that those things are informed through practicing empathy internally and externally.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. There's this kind of cultural value of just assuming good intention and asking questions to understand where someone came from. I don't know if you'll have something off the top of your head, but is there a story or an example of that comes to mind where that was done well or not done well, I don't know, in something you recently were building?

Varun Parmar (00:09:16):
Maybe there are certain things, for example, anytime we're trying to build a new experience, one of the approach we want to take is very quickly validate that our original hypothesis, is that sound or not. We are big fans of the Design Sprint framework, what Jake Knapp has done I think is really amazing. In a short five-day window, you can get a small set of people to quickly mock up a concept, convert it into some sort of a prototype and then go out there and get some sort of a validation. Oftentimes when we are working on some of these new things, we have our product teams that are focused on zero to one initiatives, run this five-day initiative, and at the end of it we say, "Oh, this is great. Who did you get insight from?" There's a capability that we recently released, it's called Miro Talktrack, which essentially allows you to asynchronously do asynchronous collaboration by recording audio video on top of a Miro board.

(00:10:16):
We had two fundamental choices we could make. One, we could go down the path of what everyone's doing where you could do a screen recording and then spit out a series of videos, like pixels being captured. Or what we did was we actually went down a different path and the path that we went down was we basically synchronized the movement of the board. Let's say Lenny's presenting a board, some template he's created in terms of best practices for PMs, but he wants to have some sort of a talk track on top of it, an audio video feed. What we are doing is we're actually capturing the movement of the board that Lenny's going through along with the video talk track that's on top. The reason why we did that was because we had an insight that came through some of our interviews.

(00:10:56):
What our users want to do is they want to use Miro for collaboration. While communication is an important aspect of how teams come together, where we believe our sweet spot is that we want people to use Miro for collaboration. By making sure that they could actually use a video recording and while the video recording is playing, they could add in a sticky note, they could add in a comment, they could actually give a reaction. We were able to develop this insight by practicing empathy as part of the Design Sprint framework when we went and started to show our original concept and we walled and built on top of that.

Lenny (00:11:31):
That is a really cool story. That came out of this Sprint framework, these five-day sprint approach.

Varun Parmar (00:11:36):
Yes, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:37):
That is cool. I got to have that guy on this podcast. Jake Knapp, you said, right?

Varun Parmar (00:11:41):
Yes, yes, yes. I can text him right now and I can make the introductions, yes.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's pull him right into this podcast live, tell us how the Sprint process works. That is awesome. This connects a little bit to another question I wanted to ask around the top is, you guys are in a really competitive space and it feels like Miro was very early in online collaborative whiteboarding space and then I think during COVID it just became huge, with the remote work exploding. Like, "Holy shit, everyone needs this immediately." Over the years, many companies have come into the space that you are all in and it feels like Miro continues to do extremely well. I remember when Figma launched FigJam, there was a lot of just like, "Miro's dead. Figma's getting into the space, they're juggernaut, game over." Clearly that's not been the case and it just feels like, I don't know what it is internally that you all do that continues to allow you to compete and continue to innovate in the space. I'm curious just like is there something to how Miro approaches competition and also just, I don't know, the way they approach these sorts of challenges that is unique or interesting that you can share?

Varun Parmar (00:12:45):
If you look at the mission for Miro, we empower teams to create the next big thing and our focus is to enable teams that are innovating, and generally innovation happens at the intersection of a bunch of cross-functional folks coming together. Like we discussed, folks in product management or design or engineering or analytics or product marketing or research. What we find, Lenny, is that there are a lot of tools out there and those tools are generally sort of focused on a particular persona and maybe they're trying to solve the needs of a designer and a designer has a workflow that they're trying to do and they're using a specific tool and they sit at the adjacency of extending that core use case. The fundamental value that Miro provides is that we enable teams. I think what's unique about our product, and we can talk about the capabilities and roadmaps and use cases that we are investing in and we already have as part of the product, is that we take a team-centric lens.

(00:13:50):
So we're not saying, "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for designers," or "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for engineers." Because we fundamentally believe that innovation happens when cross-functional teams come together. When you look at the problem through that lens, you realize that you have to actually architect your solution. You have to think about the use cases and you have to go and prioritize certain experiences that are different and our customers see value in that, right? I think that's probably one sort of big macro aspect of how we think about our capabilities and products and why our customers think of us differently. I'd say that's say one point.

(00:14:27):
I think the second thing is Miro is actually used obviously by teams that are creating these innovative products and we actually have broad applicability across industries and verticals. While some tools might be hyper-focused on digital experiences and Miro's has great offerings there in terms of core capabilities, what we find is that Miro is used equally by companies in manufacturing, by companies in healthcare, by companies in architecture and engineering and construction functions, by companies that are in aerospace, governmental agencies and medical agencies and so on and so forth. I think the platform is actually much more agnostic in terms of its capabilities and what we offer that actually makes it more accessible and appealing to organizations that want to go beyond just digital experiences.

(00:15:26):
Then I would say finally there are capabilities that are available very, very uniquely to Miro that are valued by our users. That again is a big reason people come to Miro. For example, if Lenny's trying to conduct a big workshop with a bunch of product folks and he wants to facilitate that workshop and wants to have certain folks focus on one part of the board and while others focus on the other part, then there are some advanced capabilities that enable certain use cases like workshops. Or if you want to use Miro for some team rituals or from some agile practices, there are core set of capabilities that you could use the product for that are missing in some of the other capabilities. I would say a combination of all of those three things continue to drive differentiation. I would say on top of that, we are a big fan of our community and we believe that community love is what drives us. That's the fuel that keeps us going every single day.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Just to summarize and I was taking notes as you're chatting, just thinking about what allows you all to continue to do well in the market, considering all the competition constantly coming at you. One, as you mentioned, just there's kind of like a innate multi-functional architecture which is hard for someone to copy if they weren't built from that without the start. Two, it sounds like you are focusing on a wide spectrum of personas and it's not just tech employees basically. Also, just there's specific features that end up being really important that maybe people have a hard time building and then this last piece of the community. Awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:17:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:17:09):
Let's dig into the product team a little bit and understand how you all build product and structure product team. How many PMs are there at Miro? Then just broadly, how many employees, just to give people a set of, little bit of context?

Varun Parmar (00:17:20):
Give or take about 1,800 employees at Miro globally across all of the 12 hubs, and specifically in terms of the number of product managers, there are over 450 PMs in the team.

Lenny (00:17:34):
Then how's the product team structured? Is it like outcome oriented? Is it product area oriented? Is it user persona oriented? Is it something else? How do you think about the structure of the product team?

Varun Parmar (00:17:46):
Yeah, so I would say it's maybe a hybrid structure that we have, but the foundation of the team setup is around persona. We have what we refer to as streams, some companies refer to as domains, but essentially it's a set of individuals that are focused on solving the problems for a key persona. Just to give you an example, we have a stream that's focused on enterprise, and in enterprise we are looking at the IT admin persona, we're looking at the security persona or the compliance persona. There are a set of folks who are creating a roadmap and innovating for that audience. There's another stream which is called platform where we are going after the developer install base, folks that want to use Miro as a platform and build apps that they can actually make available either on the marketplace for everyone to use or they could be developers that are inside of a large organization and they're trying to integrate Miro with their specific use cases and workflows and business systems. That's another sort of stream that's focused on that, and there are a couple of other streams like that.

(00:18:53):
Then finally there are some just horizontal sort of streams, if you will. We have a big focus given that we are a PLG-led company around growth and self-serve business. We've got a stream that's actually focused on our core internal infrastructure. We've got a stream that's actually focused on data science that's doing all of the magic that we started to release in terms of Miro AI, et cetera, et cetera. I would say it's a combination of those. At the heart of it is we are focused on personas and we are sort of aligning people around solving problems and creating value for that persona.

Lenny (00:19:24):
That is really interesting. One of the downsides of a persona-based approach I imagine is that features keep getting added that solve that user's pain points. What have you learned about keeping the product consistent and having a holistic perspective on the experience? How do you address Those challenges?

Varun Parmar (00:19:43):
Architecturally, there are two sort of things that we have done that allow us to not pigeonhole ourselves into that specific way of working. I completely agree with you, you could lead to that. The first one is actually when we think about the product org, we call our org, it's called AMPED, A-M-P-E-D. This is actually going back to our earlier point, Lenny, we had around what's unique about the product culture, what's unique about Miro, and we talked about teams coming together, removing barriers or silos cross-functionally. AMPED stands for analytics, marketing, product, engineering and design. And everything that we do in the product org, when we say the product org, we actually don't meet product managers. We actually don't mean product managers, designers and engineers. What we mean by product org in Miro is this AMPED function. By having this cross-functional representation where product marketing team is deeply, deeply embedded inside of each of these streams, what we do is that we have different perspectives that come in where they say, "Oh, wait a second, did you think about the end user experience?"

(00:20:49):
If you think about the end user experience, you know have someone on the team that says, "Wait a second, did you actually think about the enterprise requirements or what's needed in the largest corporation?" I think the unique setup of bringing these cross-functional folks allows us to sort of course correct. The second thing is the ways of working that we have. We have these product reviews that happen. We generally classify anything that we are doing in terms of its complexity around a small, medium or high complexity, and anything that's being worked on is actually being shared with the entire organization. If it's something that's small to medium, it's actually shared with the entire product org. In fact, if you are non-product, you can actually subscribe to that Slack channel as well. Everybody sees what the product org is working on, everybody sees what the core hypothesis is, "What is the solution for that, what is the proposed design for it, how are we thinking about the capabilities?"

(00:21:49):
Then anything that's big actually goes through a formal process like a product review where there's a meeting and a bunch of us are in there and it's up to us, including the product leaders, to basically make sure that we are connecting the dots in terms of having a much more holistic perspective. I would say lastly, as Miro has sort of scaled the spectrum of companies all the way from a team that might have two or three people and might be taking out their credit card and using Miro for their own team all the way to a large corporation that might have 50,000, 80,000 employees, all of them are using Miro. We've come to realize that at some point the deep enterprise requirements need to be encapsulated in a set of requirements or best practices and we need to make sure that those get democratized across all of the feature teams.

(00:22:36):
When I'm thinking about building a new feature, I have a checklist in front of me where I can say, "Here are the 10 things that I need to think of that I need to incorporate early on in my thinking in the architecture, in the definition of the process, so that it doesn't come downstream." I would say that's an area where we're still working on and more recently we put more focus and energy and there's a product manager who's now leading that particular charter.

Lenny (00:22:57):
I love all these details. This AMPED structure, I love that. There's analytics, you said product marketing, analyst marketing and then product engineering design. It's rare that you see marketing as a part of teams, as a leadership, kind of part of the leadership group. Do you have a sense of what impact adding that had on the team or where that came from? Or is that just historically been something Miro has prioritized, marketing and product marketing?

Varun Parmar (00:23:25):
This was done before I got here and I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't. I think this was the result of an observation, which is quite similar to what you're saying, which is while we might be developing a lot of the features and PMs or thinking bottoms-up in terms of what we are building, we might find that what we have built might not be able to capture the imagination of what we originally thought it would. A big part of that is how are you going to think about positioning, how are you going to think about competitive differentiation? How are you going to package it up so that the sellers that are out there are able to position it in a way that the customer, in this case the buyer, might be an IT professional, might a line business leader, can basically see the full vision of where we are going? I think by having product marketing as part of AMPED, we now bring that unique perspective that may be missing in certain teams.

(00:24:24):
PMs are more acting as product owners or more focused on core problem and solution but not thinking about positioning, because that's so important, especially when you're thinking about a market that we are increasingly in that there is competition there. That's one of the first things we started off with and that's top of mind for you as well, is that everything that we are doing has to be looked through that lens. One of the core philosophies that I have, Lenny, is that the success of a company is a direct relation of what the competition allows you to do. I feel like not many people talk about that, but in many cases in my professional career, and I've been at it for close to 24, 25 years, is that every single instance when I looked at a company accelerated their growth or there was a deceleration of growth, it was a direct relation to what the competition allowed you to do. Obviously, you have to do everything that you should be doing, but competition is the biggest variable that allows you to figure that out.

Lenny (00:25:24):
I want to hear more about your core product philosophies, but let me dig into the one you just shared. What you find is that the way you grow or stop growing is often a direct result of your competition. Is there an example of that that comes to mind? I'm guessing maybe Box versus Dropbox is an experience you had there, or if not, what's an example of that that you've experienced, to make it a little more concrete even?

Varun Parmar (00:25:50):
For those of us who've been in the collaboration space, and I've been doing collaboration and productivity apps for over 20 years, over two decades, at some point, you have companies like Microsoft that get really attracted to a space and you can see the trajectory of a business that's growing at a certain clip and then all of a sudden there's a competitive product that enters that has the might of distribution and the might of pricing, and that's just a direct example. I think I've seen that multiple times, first at Adobe where I was part of the document cloud business, clearly saw that at Box as well.

(00:26:27):
I think you can, in general, sort of look at every single category and you can say that there was a category leader and they were growing at a certain clip or a certain pace and all of a sudden there were a bunch of entrants that get in and what happens to your growth rate? It's all dependent on how strong is the competitor in terms of providing a good enough solution? That's one. The second is how strong is the competition in terms of their distribution outreach? Then the third thing is how strong is the competition in terms of the pricing and packaging?

Lenny (00:26:55):
I really like this discussion, especially because often the advice is, "Don't worry about the competition, just focus on the customer, it's going to be fine." Which what you're saying is that's not right, and I agree. What do you do with that in mind? How does that impact the way you build product or strategy? Is there some you could share that maybe tactically someone could leverage to how they're approaching their product strategy?

Varun Parmar (00:27:18):
It depends on who the competition is and what is their unfair advantage here. We talked about one specific competitor and I have a lot of respect for them, by the way, and I learn a lot from them every single day in terms of how they make bets and how they enter markets and stuff. At some point I'm going to write a book on them, I feel.

Lenny (00:27:35):
Ooh. We'll have to come back to talk about that.

Varun Parmar (00:27:38):
That's right, yeah. I think it sort of comes down to how do you think about your unique place relative to all of these players, and in your customer's mind are they able to clearly understand what is the unique value that you deliver relative to everything else? Part of that is the unique capabilities you provide. Part of that is how you're packaging those unique capabilities to them, and making sure that they in their mind can see how you coexist in this overall sort of tech ecosystem that they might be investing in, to enable their employees or to enable them to operate. So I think it's sort of looking at that from that lens, yeah.

Lenny (00:28:26):
Got it. So what I'm hearing is be very clear about your differentiator and continue to invest there and then make sure your positioning is clear around why you're... just identifying, "Here's why we're different and we're not just a better or worse version of this thing" or "Here's why we're different" and making sure that's really clear.

Varun Parmar (00:28:43):
Exactly. I think the other thing I would say, there's another core philosophy I have, which is products either get better over a period of time or they get worse. Products never remain the same. I think you can take that philosophy to a bunch of things in life, but I'm going to take the lens of products, which is my core philosophy is every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. The lens for this, Lenny, is actually from a customer's perspective, from the end user perspective. The thing is that if you are a player where there's no one else in the market, that's one thing, so that's great. Kudos to you for actually identifying a blue ocean strategy and sort of executing to that. But most markets, most products, actually have either direct or indirect competitors that are available.

(00:29:40):
From the customer's mind, you're doing something, the competitor is doing something, so in their mind they're looking at these products and they're looking at these companies and they're saying, "Which is better versus not?" So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you're either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, if you have in mind, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be. Because every single move that you're making, the customer has that sort of in their mind, if not explicitly, implicitly that they're actually comparing these things. I think it brings a level of focus in terms of where you need to invest and why you need to invest and why this is going to make those decisions.

(00:30:28):
I think it allows at least for product leaders to make some high quality decisions around the bets that they're making and how they're going to play out in terms of eventual once the dust settles and the market at large is going to say, "I'm going to standardize on something and now I feel I need to go get it for everyone." Or "This is the tool that I want to use for this particular use case." That all of these decisions that you are making ladder up to that final sort of play that you have to do in terms of the market consolidation that eventually happens.

Lenny (00:30:59):
This is so interesting. Essentially what you're saying is that you find that being very close to and understanding the competition really well is really essential, versus this kind of the other end of the spectrum almost from just like, "Don't worry about the competition, don't pay attention." I like this point, metaphor of just like, "Are we moving ahead or further behind?" Is that where you operationalize that to track that? Then also just how do you not over-obsess with, "Let's just catch up, get more features," that kind of thing? How do you find that balance?

Varun Parmar (00:31:28):
I'll be honest, I don't think we've figured it out. We haven't cracked the nut in terms of how to operationalize this, but I know you are way smarter than me on some of these things, so maybe we can-

Lenny (00:31:39):
Unlikely.

Varun Parmar (00:31:39):
... partner on this and come up with something.

Lenny (00:31:43):
All right, that'll be something we work on. Any other product philosophies that you want to share? That was awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:31:52):
This is all sort of related to it. It's like a string of pearls. I think there's maybe one more pearl we can actually thread into the needle right here.

Lenny (00:31:59):
Let's do it.

Varun Parmar (00:32:00):
Which is we talked about how do you ladder this up and stuff, and then the question is, okay, how do you know that everything that you're doing, is that in the right direction or not? Should you move slow and be much more mindful about the things that you're doing or should you move fast and make certain bets and then decide certain things and stuff? I think there are two views that are out there. My personal perspective on this is that what you want to do is that you want to be the first one to hit the brick wall. This is particularly true when you are in a market that is competitive. The reason for that is that if you consider yourself as an innovation-centric company and you believe that you are building experiences that fundamentally don't exist anywhere else and you're sort of paving the way for the rest of the folks to basically get inspired with how you are building these experiences, speed is the single biggest determinant, in my experience, in terms of who ends up being more successful versus not.

(00:33:14):
I don't know, maybe this is a little bit controversial where people say, Go slow to actually go fast." I think I have a lot of respect for that and there's certain areas you should do that, but when you are trying to figure out new experiences and stuff and you don't know if it's going to resonate or not, speed is something that you should accelerate for the organization. I think Frank Slootman talks about this a lot in his book and how can you accelerate? I think for me from a product perspective, the fundamental concept is can you be the first one to hit the brick wall where you have the learning faster than anyone else in the market so that you can decide, "Oh my god, the path that I was going was not the right path. I need to do 10 degrees west or I need to do 30 degrees east." I think as long as you're one or two or three steps ahead of everyone else in terms of uncovering or discovering those insights, then I think you can continue to be ahead of the pack in terms of building your product in business.

Lenny (00:34:21):
You're talking about urgency. I've never met a founder or a product leader who doesn't want their team to move faster. They're always encouraging their team, "How do we move faster?" I'm curious if there's something you've learned tactically about helping your team move more quickly. You mentioned Frank Slootman's book. Amp It Up is what it's called, by the way, in case folks want to check it out and he's big on just like creating a sense of urgency, constant urgency, and we'll link to that and share notes. But yeah, what have you found helps create urgency and generally helps your teams move faster other than just like, "Move faster, everyone"?

Varun Parmar (00:34:52):
My fundamental belief here, Lenny, is that every product manager... I can talk to product managers because there is reason certain ones, someone wants to be a product manager, because in my view it's one of the most thankless jobs, like you get to do a lot of [inaudible 00:35:10] and it's like, "Why you have to do this?" But it attracts a certain personality and that personality is driven by challenge and that personality wants to prove that they can solve this challenge and do something amazing. I think fundamentally the product persona actually wants to move fast. I think the reason why in some cases we are not able to move fast is because of roadblocks that we run into and those roadblocks can manifest themselves into technical challenges, they can manifest them in cells of organizational challenges, they could be priority challenges and so on and so forth.

(00:35:52):
My fundamental approach to solving that is to ensure that the product leads who are working on these capabilities can instantly raise their hand and call out that there are challenges that they are running into. Then the job of the leadership team, the product management team, is to essentially go and quickly resolve those issues. I think if you are able to resolve those issues, then what it does is it actually starts a virtuous cycle where you can actually start to see those wins. Once you see those wins, you actually create that courage to do more things. Maybe because you've seen how that specific roadblock was solved and you have a pattern matching that you've developed now, you can solve a lot of those things on your own and it's the next level of challenge that you now going to raise your hand.

(00:36:41):
What that does is it starts to build this organizational competency in terms of how you can figure out what to build. We all find these people in our organizations where there's someone somehow is able to do certain things in one-tenth the time that it would take a normal person. It's not that they are 10 times faster, it's just that in my observation that they've figured out which part of the core base they should build in versus not, who should be part of their team and who should not be, how they need to define that from a scope perspective, what does success look like, and it's the architecture of bringing all of these things together that actually brings that magic formula line in terms of "Hey, we are able to deliver faster."

Lenny (00:37:19):
I really like this topic. What I'm hearing is one of the biggest roots of slowdown in a company and product development is blockers not being unblocked, and I always feel the same thing. I feel like a PM's number one job is to unblock their team because their job is basically make the most out of their team that they're marshaling towards some outcome. The way you do that is just figure out what's slowing them down. You just talked about this idea of a PM raises their hand to leadership, "Hey, we're blocked by this thing." Is there a process you've come up with there that helps you do that, it's connected to-

Varun Parmar (00:37:51):
Yeah, I would say we are trying to sort of systematically ingrain this in the culture of the organization. We have a motto in the product org, it's very simple, single sentence, deliver customer value faster with high quality. That's it. Everything that we do, and when I say everything, everything, Lenny, from performance and reward system and measurements, everything is based on this one single statement and it has three attributes. The first one is deliver customer value, and we believe customer value is only delivered when customers use it. Anytime as a PM at Miro, when you ship something, we are looking at, "Well, what was the metric you were going to move and how much did it move?" We have some original targets that we can go back to. That's the first aspect of what we're doing, deliver customer value.

(00:38:35):
The second one is move faster, and there are certain cycle times that we are measuring across the organization. From the time you came up with the idea to the time that you actually pitched a solution to the time you actually shipped it, to the time we actually moved the metric, it's information that has been collected and is being made available to the organization. You can say, "Hey, if it was a small, medium or large, what's the average? What's the medium, what's the variance?" And you can say, "Hey, looking at this data, what can be improved?" That's on the faster aspect of it. Then the last one is around high quality, which is we want to build best in class collaboration experiences, so we are always getting inspired by what we find in applications and experiences that we see around us and we are saying, "Hey, when it comes to designing, sharing flows, we believe that these are the three apps that have best in class sharing flows when it comes to designing some synchronous capabilities like this. These are the best in class apps that we should look at."

(00:39:31):
We are always trying to make sure that we are benchmarking ourselves against that and we have our design team. On a regular basis, like when we ship stuff on a monthly basis, our design leadership team does a triage of everything that got shipped into high quality or not high quality. It's just like a binary function, and we're doing that and we're saying, "Hey, the reason why we believe it's not high quality is because A, B, C, D, E and we're making it available to other designers so they can actually start to build that telemetry in terms of some things are more subjective." But you can start to see some patent matching and say like, "Hey, this is what great looks like."

Lenny (00:40:06):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress, and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large established companies such as Vercel, Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using linear as magical. Visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:41:15):
Okay, so every month or so the design team looks at everything that's shipped and puts things into a bucket. Either this is... It's like a binary thing, high quality or not high quality.

Varun Parmar (00:41:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:41:24):
Wow, that is so cool. Then, one, what do they do with that? Do they send it out to the product team? Then two, is this just like FYI or is it like, "We need to fix all these low quality things going back"? Or is it more just like, "For the future, please be aware these are not high quality"?

Varun Parmar (00:41:39):
Yeah, so it's actually both. Generally what happens is that the design leadership team is doing this and there's one particular design leader who's the designated person to make sure that this is happening on a regular basis. Right now the way we're using it is that we are actually using it to calibrate and align around the design leadership around what we mean by high quality. Because it's one of those things, it's like if you've never seen colors and I ask you, "Lenny, describe pink and compare that to red," and if you haven't seen colors, how do you describe colors? You can't. But if I show you and I say, "Lenny, these are three examples of what pink is and these are three examples of red is," then you're like, "Oh, I get pink and I get red." There are certain things that you just like when you write it's very, very hard to describe it, but if you show specific examples, it's very clear, "Oh, I get it. I get how pink is different than red." But if I try to describe it, it's going to be very hard.

(00:42:35):
So we got into these endless conversations at some point about a year ago where we were saying, "We need high quality, we need high quality." And people are like, "Let's just go and define this thing." We had a bunch of our leaders go and write documents, really long documents in terms of what are the attributes and how do we define those attributes and how do we measure those attributes and how do we enable people to do that? It felt like it's a good thing because we are trying to codify it, but it also felt like it was a very heavy way of solving that problem. Then we just came up with this approach, which is like, "What's great versus not great" and just start classifying it. As you know, it's like modern AI systems are classification systems and we [inaudible 00:43:12]-

Lenny (00:43:12):
Yeah, I was going to say, sounds like reinforcement learning approach here.

Varun Parmar (00:43:14):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:43:14):
Defining cost.

Varun Parmar (00:43:15):
That's right. That's right. I think it's worked decently well. I would say with most things we need to operationalize it and we need to make sure that now we are democratizing it and everybody has access to it and so on and so forth. But I think it's been a good start and now we are sharing this more openly with others in the org.

Lenny (00:43:37):
When I said that, I imagined you... From the outside, you have a very unique culture and approach your product. That's a great example of that. I've never heard of a process like this. What I'm hearing is essentially you're trying to build the muscle within the organization of what is quality. It's like this continued heuristic of, "Okay, I get it." So PMs on the team start to understand in their head what that means.

Varun Parmar (00:43:56):
Right.

Lenny (00:43:57):
Super cool. You also talked about, in the middle part of that sentence, of moving faster and that you track and measure that somehow. Can you talk more about that? Because that's something every product team is always trying to understand. "How do we know if we're going faster, if we're going as fast as we could?" How do you actually do that? How do you measure these things?

Varun Parmar (00:44:13):
The core philosophy there is velocity is more like the game of golf where you're just playing against yourself. It's not like if Lenny and Varun are out at the golf course, it doesn't matter. I'm not competing against you, I'm just competing against myself because that's the only... I'm going to just hit the ball, so it's like how much better can we get? I think our core philosophies around that and what we're trying to do is that on all the product teams, the feature teams that we have, we're just collecting all the information and we are making it available to everyone so that they can actually see what the cycle times are. What we are interested in is from the time that you have an insight, from the time you believe "I can do something unique for my user, for my persona," how long does it take for you to actually deliver that value?

(00:45:04):
We have a product process that we follow, which starts with a P-strat, which is a strategy, and then we go into P0, which is definition of the problem, then we go into P1, which is definition of the solution, and then we go into P2, which is once the solution is shipped, are we hitting the metrics that we originally had defined upfront before we decided to work on this. You have all of these stage gates and then we basically classify everything that we are doing in small, medium, large. You can go in and you can say, "Hey, I thought this was a small thing," and small thing is something you can get it done in less than a month, and so on and so forth. There are 50 other product teams that are shipping these features, and what's the average, what's the variance, what's the median?

(00:45:48):
"Oh, wait a second, actually it seems like I took way more time in the problem definition stage. Let me actually try to go talk to this other product team that actually did it much faster," or "Oh, I actually did it really, really fast, and the reason why I did it fast was because of this. Let me go share this out with the broader team." Usually the product ops function, we call it product excellence internal, sort of product excellence function, is recording some of these things. I would say getting reliable data, and then because we have some things that are going through meetings and there are some things that are going through Slack, we could do better on some of those dimensions, but all of this data is available and we provided it openly and folks can benchmark themselves against that.

Lenny (00:46:34):
So cool. Okay, so you have this P-strat, you called it, document which is kind an initial concept and then it's interesting you use the P0, P1, which is often for bugs, but it's cool that you use it for defining your products. So P-strat is just an idea pitch. P0 is a spec, basically, like a one-pager for the product, and then P1 and P2 are basically getting to "Here's the actual product we're building." And you basically track time per step and map it to, "Here's how large this project should be." Over time you track per person, it sounds like, just like are you matching the benchmarks of how long a small project should take across each step?

Varun Parmar (00:47:13):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:47:14):
Wow, that is extremely cool. Whatever templates you can share, these things that we can include in the show notes would be awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:47:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:22):
Because people are always looking for just like, "Ah, I want do some of this stuff." If they can just plug and play, the more, the merrier.

Varun Parmar (00:47:28):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:29):
Shifting a little bit, it sounds like you guys are doing Scrum in some form. Can you just talk about just broadly the product development process? How long you or your sprints, how long do you plan for in the future, in detail specifically just like high level, how does the product development process work?

Varun Parmar (00:47:43):
There are certain things that I learned at Box and that inspired some things that we do at Miro, and there are certain things that we've evolved. One of the things that we've instituted is our roadmap process, so that's sort of the first thing around how the different teams are looking at the things that they're going to work on. We have a rolling six month roadmap, it seems large, but we've got, like I mentioned, a number of enterprise customers. If I've learned one thing that large enterprises is asking for a roadmap review. That tends to be my favorite meeting of sitting down with the enterprise leaders and walking through what we are working on. What we've done is we've tried to architect something which actually allows our customers to get what they're looking for, but at the same time does not remove the agility that is so important for us to deliver value faster.

(00:48:41):
What we do is we have a rolling six month roadmap that gets updated every three months and the first three months of that roadmap, we have a 80% position level, which means that 80% of the things that we claim to be on the roadmap will get done. That's the target. For the next three months, because it's six months, so the first three months is 80%, the next three months is 50%, so we have a much lower level of resolution in the next three months after that. What that allows the product teams to do is actually have flexibility, which is based on what the customers are asking for and based on what the competitive moves are, based on some technology breakthroughs that happen around large language models, they can pivot and they can pivot and move towards that and they won't get penalized either by the customer or internally in terms of doing that. That's what we do and that's all at on the backdrop of an annual strategy that we publish.

(00:49:34):
Every year we publish a strategy white paper that it gets published internally available to every single Mironeer across all functions that clearly articulates the key bets that we want to make. Why do we want to make those bets? What is the expected outcome and how does that ladder up into the overall business outcomes that we are trying to drive from an OKR perspective as well as the overall business strategy that we have. So people take that product strategy, white paper or artifact, and then against that they're building their roadmaps which get updated every three months. Then inside of the teams, we enable teams to be quite autonomous in terms of some of the rituals that they're doing. We want them to obviously embrace best practices. We've got a team of agile coaches that share best practices or are available to help if there's certain specific needs that teams have.

(00:50:31):
Then I think on top of that, there are certain key, I would say, rituals that we do that maybe are unique. For example, we have something called as Miro Connect, which happens every other Friday. Every other Friday, for example, in our Amsterdam office, you can go in there and at 4:00 in the afternoon, 4:00 to 7:00 or 8:00, and sometimes it goes really late, you've got a bunch of product teams sitting around tables and it feels like, "Oh, it's like a pitch or something." And people are coming in, they're having a good time, you've got a drink in your hand, there's maybe some light music playing in the background and you're going from table to table and you have teams that are actually showing all the amazing work that... If done right, it happens once in a while, but if done right, it's magical in terms of the outcomes that you can get.

(00:51:20):
I'll tell you, there was a team that actually was presenting at our Berlin hub and they were saying, "We're working on this feature, and there's an engineer who walks over to that desk and says, 'What are you working on?'" The team describes it, "Oh, we are trying to do something like this." And this engineer had actually worked on that particular problem in their prior life, literally they had implemented this. So he says, "So how are you going to implement this?" And the team, the engineer that's sitting there, says, "This is the approach I'm going to take and it's going to take me three months." He's like, "Oh, would you mind if I go and help you with this?" They're like, "Sure, more the merrier. Go ahead." So this person puts down their beer and says, "Okay, I'm having a good time. Let me just head back to my home." And in the next three or four hours goes and codes the entire thing, makes a poll request.

(00:52:10):
Next day in the morning one of the engineers from this core team that was exhibiting at Miro Connect looks at the poll request, reviews the code and says, "Yes, something that would have taken three months for this core team because they didn't have the expertise literally got done in three hours because there was another engineer that ran into them and said, "I know how this is done. I can actually help you here," and went ahead and did the right thing. We are trying to create these magic moments. It happens once in a while, but we have one success story and I like to tell that in every opportunity that I get. But that's another sort of unique thing that we've done in terms of book-ending things around how we operate here.

Lenny (00:52:50):
That story is like a dream for any PM. Just imagine saving months of work with one conversation. I imagine people were like, "How do we replicate this often?" I love that. With these meetings, just to understand, if their team is in Berlin, let's say, there's a screen there in front of a table and they're talking through a screen, like a video conference?

Varun Parmar (00:53:12):
Yeah. I mean, right now what we've figured out is that it is really hard to do these events over audio-video conferencing and stuff. So generally what happens is that you have an audio-video bridge that's playing, but mostly it's people walking up to the respective teams and then having a live conversation. That's usually how these things are operated. Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Got it. Okay, so you have six month rolling roadmaps. You have a yearly vision strategy for the company, two week sprints. Is there also a quarterly OKR sort of process or is it-

Varun Parmar (00:53:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:48):
... those or not? There is, okay.

Varun Parmar (00:53:48):
There is, yeah.

Lenny (00:53:49):
Can you just talk a little bit about how that works?

Varun Parmar (00:53:51):
Yes, yes, yes. At Miro, we practice OKRs and it starts off at the company level, and then those company level OKRs are taken by the AMPED organization. Like we describe, it's the AMPED organization, and then we break it up and I would say we have refined it over the period of time, the two years that I've been at Miro. Early on we were doing OKRs on a quarterly basis, and I would say more recently we've actually evolved to six month KRs. What we found was that six month was the right cadence in terms of giving enough time for teams to basically push forward in executing these KRS and minimizing the "overhead" of doing replan every single quarter. We found that it was much more effective and efficient for the entire organization to do it on a six-month basis. However, we are doing traction on a monthly basis. So every four weeks, as AMPED, we are looking at our KRS for the AMPED organization on a monthly basis doing traction. However, the planning, the targets, are done on a six-month basis.

Lenny (00:55:06):
I love how OKRs could just be anything, could be every six months, could have objectives, could have key results. It's just such a term that just applies to anything that people do with goals, basically.

Varun Parmar (00:55:17):
That's true.

Lenny (00:55:18):
And it works. It's great.

Varun Parmar (00:55:19):
That is so true.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Again, if there's any templates that your team could share of the way you do that stuff, that would be amazing, and we'll include that in the show notes.

Varun Parmar (00:55:27):
Yeah, absolutely. Because I think, as you would expect, we run Miro on Miro, so there's a lot of things that we could share as templates in terms of how we are running things on Miro, not just as OKRs, but in terms of product reviews. We have ways of how we are doing asynchronous reviews combined with synchronous reviews and there's this blended experiences that we have, and so we can definitely share out with the community how we do some of these things.

Lenny (00:55:55):
Awesome. That's a great segue to another question I was going to ask is just what other tools, what's in the stack of the product team's workflow? So Miro, obviously. Maybe talk about what use Miro for, but then what else is in there? What do you use for task management, bug tracking, things like that? Design?

Varun Parmar (00:56:12):
Starting from the bottom-up infrastructure view, so all of our tickets are handled in Jira and we are using some of the newer capabilities in Jira in terms of coming up with roadmaps and coming up with the priorities and stuff. On top of that, all of the specs generally get recorded in Confluence. Having said that, we're actually a big fan of tools like Google Docs as well as Coda that allows us to track our KRs in a pretty effective way. On top of that, obviously we use Miro a lot, I would say for a lot of our things, especially on the product and design side of the team. Generally all of our insights get captured inside of Miro board, so when we are going and conducting user experience interviews and stuff, we will record those and then those recordings get added to a Miro board, so Miro access the content hub or a team hub for a particular project.

(00:57:20):
Once you capture all of those insights, then generally all of the brainstorming and team ideation happens on the Miro board as well, so Miro's actually also used as a tool to facilitate meetings and workshops. Once all of that is synthesized into a set of recommendations and outcomes, so when we go into these product reviews that we were talking about, Lenny, the same Miro board then gets manifested into a set of presentations, so we use Miro for presentations. We've actually made some really amazing updates in terms of our capabilities there and if folks haven't checked them out, I would strongly encourage them. There's a capability called Showtime that basically abstracts out the UI and lets people focus on the content, but do it in a way that it's interactive so everyone that's on the call can have reactions, can share their comments and leave comments while the presentation is happening without actually disrupting any of the flow for the user, so we use that a lot for presentations as well.

(00:58:15):
I would say more recently what we've started to do is that we've started to move some of our synchronous meetings into asynchro view. I talked about this Talktrack feature that we have, and a lot of teams, what they would do is that they would actually send you five minute, 10 minute Talktrack in advance and it's just a link to a Miro board, you click on it and then you just sit back and relax. Then you have this magical experience where you're sitting back and the Miro board is automatically moving because Lenny was recording it like that. Then you have the video play and then you can pause it anytime, you can add in your comments and stuff so that the next time when you meet, instead of actually providing context to everyone, those synchronous sessions are lot more deliberate and focused on driving outcomes or achieving consensus, so people are just focusing on the comments that were added as part of a async product review so that when they meet synchronously they can use that. Miro boards are used for that as well.

(00:59:06):
I would say now a lot of our dashboarding shows up in Miro boards now. We recently released data visualization capabilities around most popular VI tools. At Miro we use Google Looker a lot, so a lot of our dashboards are in Looker, and what you would typically find is that our analyst team and product teams will just grab a link to a Looker dashboard, put it on a Miro board, and it unfolds into a full visualization. Unlike a screen grab, you never have to go update it because right there on the Miro board, it's always updated and you can refresh that, so you basically have this experience where Miro acts as that single source of truth for a lot of the teams across the entire journey of product development where a single Miro board is meeting the needs of multiple use cases there.

Lenny (00:59:51):
Then for the road-mapping, is that in Miro, each team's roadmap, or do you use something like Jira?

Varun Parmar (00:59:57):
Yeah, so I think we've got a couple of tools for road-mapping, and our observation is that while those tools are great for the unique needs that they're solving, we haven't found a universal solution for road-mapping. So there are some teams that use Miro for road-mapping and they would use the Kanban widget in Miro for that. What are they working on? What's coming next? What's in the backlog? But I would say it is a problem that is not completely solved in terms of how do we actually bring these artifacts together at scale.

(01:00:27):
What we are starting to see, and this is actually a unique use case of Miro, is that we actually enable our entire field organization using Talktracks. What happens is that we have our entire roadmap published out as a Miro board for enablement purposes, so that that's a artifact that is approved to be shown to a customer. What you will see is that you'll see five or six recordings in there, and the leader for enterprise has done a five-minute recording on everything they're working on. The leader for platform has done that. The leader for end user experience has done that. The person who's driving some of our AI experience has done that. So you can go in and you can just click on that video and you can meet your needs by using Miro and this capability that we have.

Lenny (01:01:09):
That's awesome. It sounds like each team can basically choose the tools they want to use. There's no standardized, everyone needs to use Jira or Miro for their roadmap. I like that. I like how teams do that often. Maybe one last question around the product org, and then I want to shift a little bit to growth and how Miro grows and things you have learned about growing. Question I always try to get to is how do you think about balancing new bets and innovation with maintenance and just general incremental work? Do you have some sort of philosophy as a product leader broadly, and then maybe at Miro specifically, of just how to balance investments in these two buckets and maybe three buckets, bugs, incremental work, and then just big bet? How do you think about that?

Varun Parmar (01:01:55):
We have some rule of thumbs in terms of how we want to allocate our investments across these buckets. I would say a lot of it, Lenny, actually depends on the state of the team. There are certain teams that have more tech debt than others. There are certain teams that are actually working on some really big zero to one features than other teams, and so I think there is a variance. The standard deviation actually is dependent on which part of the spectrum that you're in, which is are you a team that we believe needs to create the next generation experience on the platform and hence we have to prioritize innovative work or are you the team that's actually so critical to actually meeting our objective around better board performance or any of the other things that we believe are important and hence we need to invest in those critical areas?

(01:02:41):
But I would say in general innovation versus not, varies on a spectrum of anywhere from 60 to 80%. I would say about 20 to 40% of the available capacity at any given time is either getting allocated to architectural initiatives. There's a technology roadmap that our CTO is driving that we believe is extremely important as the platform scales, and now as we have over 50 million people on the platform, so we continuously have to invest in making sure that the platform can scale. There are certain teams that probably have 40 to 50% of their allocation towards that because they're a critical part of the component. There are other teams that are maybe more end user focused and are more UI focused where that allocation is lower. But I think general rule of thumb is 20% is always a given, but it can go as high as 40 to 50%.

Lenny (01:03:30):
On bigger bets and longer-term thinking?

Varun Parmar (01:03:33):
Yeah, 20 to 40% goes on the technology-related initiatives and maintenance and stuff.

Lenny (01:03:38):
Oh, got it. Infrastructure, maintenance, making sure everything's there. Got it.

Varun Parmar (01:03:44):
[inaudible 01:03:44] Exactly, yeah.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Then what about just big, long-term bets that you're not expecting to pay off anytime soon? Do you have a heuristic of just what percentage of, say, total resources you put there?

Varun Parmar (01:03:53):
You've probably seen this, the framework of three horizon, it's quite popular in McKinsey and Harvard [inaudible 01:04:01] school and so on and so forth, is horizon one business, which is the thing that's delivering food on the table. Generally there's about a 70% allocation of resources that we have, give or take. Then there is horizon two, which is an adjacent thing. With the next 12 to 36 months we believe it's material. Usually that tends to be around 20% of the allocation. Then there's horizon three, which is three years out, three to five years, next generation things, and that's about 10% of the ratio. So it's like 70/20/10 across horizon one, two, and three.

Lenny (01:04:30):
Awesome. Any other thoughts along the lines of just how you think about product before we shift? I only have a few questions around the growth story of Miro and what you've learned about growing.

Varun Parmar (01:04:41):
In terms of product leadership and what we believe is the way we want product leaders to be developed and I think it's more of a people philosophy. We have our product leadership which constitutes of all of the folks who are running all of these streams, and I always tell them that you have two personas that you have to think about. Everyone who's on the product leadership team is a product leadership team member. The fundamental thing that you have to do is drive accountability. The number one thing that a product leader on the product leadership team needs to do is drive accountability with others in the product leadership team. The other persona that they have is that they are a stream leader. They're actually responsible for delivering value for the respective persona and respective customers and stuff. So when you put on the persona hat of a stream leader, which is different than the persona or of a product leader, your number one metric, the number one goal that you have, is drive improvement.

(01:05:42):
When you go back and you work with your team, always have the lens are you improving things and whatever you want to improve, but you always have to ask yourself, "Today compared to yesterday, tomorrow compared to today, have I improved things? That's the yardstick you should think about. When you go sit in the product leadership team every Monday afternoon at 1:00 in the afternoon when we meet together, your number one goal is actually to drive accountability around this and are you making sure that we as leaders in the organization are doing the right thing for the company?" I think that's a philosophical construct that I always remind people in terms of what they should be doing. As an example, tomorrow we have calibrations, we have our annual review cycle happening in the company.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Good times. Always a blast.

Varun Parmar (01:06:23):
Yes, exactly, always fun and so critical as a leader, because it sets the tone for everything that you're going to do. In my opening remarks, the only thing I'm going to remind everyone in the room is that "Your number one goal here is to be a product leader and accountability is what you have to write. That's it. Just hold each other as accountable, including myself in terms of making sure that as we go in, that's the key thing." I think once people understand the duality of how they need to operate across those two specific goals, it actually leads to really high-performing teams and teams that actually are able to create somewhat of a magic if they are open and there is trust that has been built in the team.

Lenny (01:07:07):
When you say accountability, what does that look like? Is it pointing out, "Hey, you didn't achieve this thing we were trying to achieve" or "You didn't do a great job leading this meeting"? Is it just direct feedback often or is there some other way you see that manifested, and what do you like to see?

Varun Parmar (01:07:24):
Yeah, I think it's basically practicing feedback in a very open and constructive way and focusing on what is important for the business and not shying away from having some of those observations and conversations, not shying away from them. But it's all in the lens of what is the right thing to do for the business, and if you feel that that one or more members of the leadership team are not living up to what needs to be done, then just voicing it. It's not like you're complaining or anything, it's just like, "I have this perspective. Is this the right perspective or not?" Because actually it ties very well with the overall cultural values that we have.

(01:08:02):
If you do things with the lens that you are being empathetic, then you pose it as a question as opposed to a statement. I think that's one of the things that we practice a lot at Miro is that I believe that I am seeing there are certain things that are happening that it could be just me that I'm not seeing the other things. "But what is it? Can you help me understand? Can you help me figure out that why certain things are happening? Because I might just be missing the perspective." But because you bring it up, and that's part of practicing accountability in an empathetic way, it actually gets the entire team in the right mindset in terms of how they operate.

Lenny (01:08:39):
Has anyone given you some sort of direct feedback recently or pointed out something you didn't do well that held you accountable that you can share?

Varun Parmar (01:08:47):
All the time. Yeah, all the time. When we do our offsites, this is actually a fun thing, is that every offsite that I do with my leadership team, usually there is a one to two hour session where it is feedback to Varun, and I actually do it openly. I will have about eight to 10 people in the room and I will force people to be very honest and I want to show my vulnerabilities to everyone, that I am not perfect and I have lots of areas to improve. Every time people do it, it's interesting that they open up in very amazing ways and I think I love it because it helps me become better. It helps me identify my blind spots. But what it does is, because I do it in an open way, it brings a lot of trust. It brings trust that I do it openly and I'm an open book and they can share whatever they want, not just with me but openly in front of everyone.

Lenny (01:09:43):
Are you willing to share one thing they suggested that they pointed out that they wish you did differently or better?

Varun Parmar (01:09:48):
Yeah, I think in general, finding time with me tends to be a bit of a hard thing, and generally there's always this feedback, which is need more time, maybe more responsiveness over email or Slack or something like that. That's an area that I'm constantly working on and improving, so yeah.

Lenny (01:10:11):
That feels like a cop out. That doesn't feel too painful to hear. I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't have a lot of time. I'm sorry." But I get it, and that comes back to your point about blockers and how important it's to unblock teams because that leads to a lot faster progress.

Varun Parmar (01:10:26):
That's true, that's true.

Lenny (01:10:28):
Okay, so let me shift a little bit to Miro's growth and I only have a few questions here. I know it's getting late on your side so I don't want to keep you too long.

Varun Parmar (01:10:34):
Sure.

Lenny (01:10:35):
The first is something I'm on this constant quest to understand how companies got their first users, and I haven't actually heard the story of how Miro got its first thousand users or customers. I know you weren't there in the early days, but you happen to know how Miro initially grew and got their first thousand users and customers?

Varun Parmar (01:10:53):
I think the fundamental thing there is that we always had user first approach and reaching out to certain communities that were relevant to what was a key part of lighting the fire, if you will, the proverbial way people start to talk about the product. Given the collaborative nature of the product, some of the early adopters invited people who were also early adopters and the flywheel started to work. I've heard that we did a fair amount of content marketing and listing the product on sites like Capterra sort of helped. There was some early investments in terms of SEO and organic growth, so there was a focus there, which was the main source of driving traffic. The top of the funnel came through that.

(01:11:43):
The product teams were very intensely focused on building vital loops as a key mechanism of driving growth, once the traffic came in. Every interaction that actually introduced barrier, they looked at it and they looked at the data and they said, "Let's reduce this barrier. Let's remove this thing so that the product could be effectively embraced." It was an evolution over a period of time. There was also the fact that early on in the journey, some of the features were presented on a trial basis and then later on the model was evolved from a trial basis, time limited to a premium model that further accelerated the growth for the business. I would say those were some of the approaches that were taken to get to the first thousand users or so.

Lenny (01:12:34):
You talked about how Miro grows, where it has this magical loop of "I use Miro to for myself, then I share it with my team in whatever way I'm using it." They're like, "Oh, Miro, this is cool." Then they start using it and then they share it with people that they want to work with, and it creates this loop of growth." I imagine that's how Miro mostly grew initially and continues to grow. Is there anything surprising or unintuitive about how Miro grows that is beyond that? I imagine sales is a part of it and we can talk about that, but is there anything else that is interesting that is worth mentioning?

Varun Parmar (01:13:07):
No, I think that's the key of the growth. I think there are specific use cases where they are uniquely sort of geared towards inviting a lot of new people. For example, Miro is loved as a workshopping tool, and so generally one person is using Miro, but they invite 10, 15, 20, 50, 200, 300 people to that workshop. There are specific use cases where people get introduced to the product and then go and sign up for it and then start to use it for that use case or other use cases. I think the other accelerant in all of this is the templates that we have, in particular the role that Miroverse plays in all of this.

(01:13:49):
Just to give you an example here, there was a template which was created around FIFA World Cup, so there was a FIFA World Cup diagram. Cornelius, he's the founder and managing director of a Canadian strategic service design consultancy firm. He created this Miroverse template and it had over 100,000 views and about 15,000 copies were made of the single template. Given the popularity of all of this, it actually got indexed by Google. When you went in the search, you actually saw the Miroverse FIFA template show up when you were trying to search for FIFA World Cup, and that was another sort of acquisition channel top of funnel that actually drew a lot of users to it. So I think I would say the Miroverse is also a key accelerant to this.

Lenny (01:14:45):
If you had to think about the pie chart of how Miro grows, what percentage roughly would you say is word of mouth, organic, versus what you just described, which is essentially a CO versus sales, outbound sales? How do you think about that? Is there a way to model that simply?

Varun Parmar (01:15:02):
Without getting into specific numbers and stuff, I would say fundamentally Miro is a product-led growth company and product channels are one of the highest contributors for growth of users. As the business has evolved to serve the needs of some of the largest corporations in the world, the enterprise segment and the enterprise persona when they're trying to provision Miro for tens of thousands of users who then go conduct hundreds of thousands of workshops on Miro that invite millions of users on the platform, is a key part of the flywheel that we are seeing. I would say product channels are probably very strong and increasingly enterprise is a key part of that acceleration.

Lenny (01:15:53):
A great segue to our final question, which is the idea that you started a product growth, sounds like clearly it's a big part of growth today, but as every product growth company does eventually you have a large sales team, I imagine, what have you learned as a product leader working with sales, especially at a product growth company about how to make that relationship work and have a product work effectively with a sales org?

Varun Parmar (01:16:15):
There are a few learnings and I would say maybe this is one area where we are working on how we could be doing better in terms of bringing ourselves closer to our high-touch and bringing high-touch closer to self-serve, in terms of how we operate overall. It's a lot of hard work, I would say first of all, basically, to bring both of these organizations together and you have to be very deliberate around the points of intersection and you have to make sure that these organizations don't consider themselves as competition. It's one product, one company, just two channels of how we are serving our customers. There's some things that we've done which is have the product marketing team that basically works across both of these functions and make sure that they are bridging what we are hearing from the sales organization in terms of what directly customers need on the enterprise side, and then what do we need on the self-serve side.

(01:17:23):
There's a full process in terms of how the handoff happens across the maturity of the account. It can start as a self-serve, it drives adoption, and once there's adoption, there's a hand raiser that happens and then there's a sales rep that gets engaged and you go through the qualification process and then you have an opportunity to expand the account. We've over the years sort of architected and built the entire funnel and what the process is, and that's also sort of a key part of how all of this operates. But like I said, I think there are a few areas where we could further streamline how we operate and think of it as one single unit.

Lenny (01:18:05):
I imagine that is true for every company out there.

Varun Parmar (01:18:07):
Yes.

Lenny (01:18:09):
One maybe final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. What are some features that people could look forward to that are coming with Miro?

Varun Parmar (01:18:19):
We recently, about a month ago, announced Miro AI, the backdrop of all the amazing work that's happening around generative AI and large language models and stuff. I think it was really, really exciting to see all of the community enthusiasm around the use cases that we launch. So we're going to be taking it across the finish line and doing a general availability in the coming weeks and months. I think that's one big thing and we'll be adding more capabilities there. Just today we actually announced a bunch of really deep enhancements and updates around how Miro can be used for team rituals and agile practices. Now you can actually do retrospectives in Miro where you can have a private mode where while Lenny's typing his feedback during retrospective, nobody else can see it and then one click you can reveal it. I just saw some of the results of the feedback and it was rated as the number one feature people saw.

(01:19:14):
There's also some deeper integrations in terms of bringing an entire program board from Jira to start to do dependency mapping inside of Miro in a fun and collaborative way, to use this dependency mapping along with program board to start to do program increment planning, which is essentially scrum of scrums or big room planning that's happening. There's some really amazing capabilities that we've added there, which is on the backdrop of some of the updates we've made in terms of estimation of sprint story points and so on and so forth. Now there's a whole plethora of capabilities and apps that are available as part of the platform that allow you to have your entire team conduct your team rituals in Miro and you can automate certain things, you can streamline things, you can do certain things in async and then do the rest in synchronous ways, so I think that's been a big update as well.

Lenny (01:20:12):
Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Varun Parmar (01:20:19):
Yes.

Lenny (01:20:20):
All right, let's do it. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Varun Parmar (01:20:26):
One is, I love this, When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. It's one of those really emotional books that at the end of it, you might have tears in your eyes, but really, really amazing. We talked about Frank Slootman's Amp It Up, and then Satya Nadella's Hit Refresh. I think philosophically some of the things that we talked about today are inspirations that I found in some of these books.

Lenny (01:20:49):
What's a recent favorite movie or TV show?

Varun Parmar (01:20:52):
Ted Lasso. I don't know if it's a recent one or not, but something-

Lenny (01:20:55):
It's a new season.

Varun Parmar (01:20:57):
Yeah, I've enjoyed a lot. I think it's a very positive and uplifting message. I think the performance is huge. It's humorous, the characters are well-developed, so I think overall it's a treat, at least for, me to watch.

Lenny (01:21:13):
What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?

Varun Parmar (01:21:16):
I actually ask a math problem. For those of you who interviewed with me, I have this math problem, which is based on how Adobe created its first Creative Suite bundle. I was actually part of the team that came up with the pricing and packaging for the first Creative Suite post-acquisition of Macromedia. It's a math problem that allows you very quickly to figure out people in terms of their problem-solving skills. Usually I give that problem to people. I've given it to, I don't know, 700, 800 people, so I now have a very, very well established standard distribution of how long it takes for people, where do they get stuck and where they've gotten stuck, for those people I've hired, what evidence do I have in terms of using that as a framework in terms of them being able to solve things? So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:22:08):
So you're saying you've mapped back people that have done a certain way on the problem with their success and you've kind of found that it's a good signal of their performance?

Varun Parmar (01:22:17):
Yes. Not directly, but yes, correlation and stuff.

Lenny (01:22:21):
That's amazing. That's one of the biggest problems with interviewing. You think you're asking all these amazing questions and it's such a good signal, you have no idea. No one goes back and is like, "Oh, this person sucked. This person didn't... " That's really cool to get that much data on that one question. Two more questions for you. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in how you do product development that has had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute?

Varun Parmar (01:22:44):
We talked about some of that, sort of removing the roadblocks. I think having this motto of great customer value faster with high quality, just the simplicity of that and it's actually part of our evaluation rubric, it's part of how we measure ourselves and stuff. So I think just coming up with these simple concepts that you can rally the organization around, and I think it's still a work in progress, but something that I believe is leading to positive outcomes.

Lenny (01:23:07):
Final question. What's your favorite Miro template?

Varun Parmar (01:23:10):
It's the FIFA World Cup actually. I am so fascinated with what was done. Yeah, it's the latest one, but I think there's a bunch of them in terms of retros as well, and I think... like your template as well.

Lenny (01:23:21):
Amazing. We will link to all of those. Varun, this was amazing. Everything I expected and more, your team is as interesting and unique as I thought, and I am excited for people to learn from you and we're going to share a lot of links alongside this episode in the show notes. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Varun Parmar (01:23:43):
Thank you, Lenny. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed our interaction. You folks can find me online on LinkedIn. I think that's probably the best way to connect with me. I think in terms of one or two things I can ask everyone is that, one is if you are an existing Miro user and you use the product for something interesting, I highly encourage you to contribute it as a template as part of Miroverse. There's a lot of folks who use that and we would love for you to contribute there. The second thing is, I know a lot of product development teams, PMs and designers are big fans of you, Lenny, so those are also the users that use Miro. If there's anything we could do to make the product better, if there's things that you feel like we can expand the platform into, we would love to hear from you and just reach out to me directly over LinkedIn, direct message or connect with me there and yeah, and let us know. We're here to serve.

Lenny (01:24:40):
Amazing. Varun, thank you again for being here.

Varun Parmar (01:24:43):
Thanks, Lenny. Awesome.

# An inside look at Mixpanel’s product journey | Vijay Iyengar

## Transcript

Vijay Iyengar (00:00):
The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself right for disruption in your core because someone else can out invests you in that core. And so if you are the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invests everyone else in that core and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
Lenny (00:40):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Vijay Iyengar. Vijay is currently head of product at Mixpanel. He actually has a very similar career trajectory to myself where he started as an eng intern at Amazon. Then he was an engineer for a while at Uber, then he became an eng manager at Mixpanel. But then he shifted from an ENG manager to director of product, and now head of product at Mixpanel. You don't often see people moving from an leadership role straight to director of product, so it was really interesting to hear what he took from his eng experience and brought into his approach to product leadership. But we spent the bulk of our time talking about what he's learned from the journey that Mixpanel has been on, where they started with a simple product, then scaled to a number of different products, solving many problems for customers, and then made the hard decision to scale back to just a single core focused analytics product.
(01:33):
We talk about why they made that choice, what they learned about when it makes sense to expand a new product and when you probably shouldn't, and how they approach that organizationally. We also talk about how Mixpanel builds product, how they think about products philosophy, how they prioritize, and also what you're probably doing wrong in how you set up your analytics for your own product. With that, I bring you Vijay Iyengar after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming subjective bias, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards, resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. Vijay, welcome to the podcast.
Vijay Iyengar (03:52):
Thank you, Lenny. Great to be here. Huge fan of the pod, and so glad I can contribute.
Lenny (03:57):
I definitely want to talk about Mixpanel's journey both as a product team and a product. But before we get there, as an engineer, you were in a longtime engineer and then you became a product leader, is there anything you had to unlearn as an engineer in the way you thought about leadership and product and business?
Vijay Iyengar (04:13):
One of the things after you've been in engineering for a while is that develop this tendency to immediately respond with no to new ideas. And I think from the engineering perspective, this is because you spend a lot of your time building and maintaining ideas that maybe are half thought out or didn't really go anywhere, and you just feel like the full brunt of the maintenance cost of that. And so you build up the scar tissue and this immune response to say no to new ideas, and it's a hard no, like no, we're definitely not going to do it. And I think I had to unlearn that moving into product because you get a lot of ideas coming from a lot more places in the organization, and ideas are fragile in their agency and it's a hard no can really kill a whole direction that you could potentially go.
(04:55):
They could be very high reach and high impact. So, one thing that I've found is the best way to get to a no, if you ultimately need to get there, is to try to make it work. Start trying to make yes work and document how you've tried to make yes work. And do that earnestly, not as an exercise of just an alternative that you're considering. Try to do it sincerely and get to know after trying to make yes work. And so that's one thing I've been trying to just apply my engineer problem solving brain to do that instead of thinking about how it might not work and saying no.
Lenny (05:25):
Is that something that you recommend engineers work on looking back? I know as a PM, it's like, oh, I love when engineers say yes. This is awesome. I'm going to actually help everyone learn to say yes. But as an engineer, obviously that's a challenge often. What do you recommend to folks that are engineers currently that maybe want to improve on this or shift in how they think about saying yes, saying no when they're asked about something new?
Vijay Iyengar (05:48):
I think some of the best engineers that I've worked with actually already do this, but [inaudible 00:05:53] they're able to balance both in their head. So, ultimately this balancing act, you just want on-call, you were woken up three times at 3:00 AM due to various bad ideas, and the next morning you wake up and then stand up, it's like, "Hey, can we do this new thing?" You kind of have to have that empathy and do that. So yeah, I think the exercise is just take 10 minutes to consider the idea and just sincerely consider how might we make it work. And if at the end of those 10 minutes, it's like futile and there's no path, it's fine to say no. And it's a good instinct to say no, actually in a lot of cases. But yeah, I would recommend that to engineers. I think it would've been better in my career, for sure, if I had learned that sooner.
Lenny (06:26):
I want to spend some time on the Mixpanel product journey. It's been an interesting rollercoaster. I think the company's been around for how many years? Since 2010? 2009?
Vijay Iyengar (06:34):
20009, yeah.
Lenny (06:35):
So, I know it started as kind of a very simple product analytics product back in the day. And then as you do with ambitious companies, you look for more problems to solve. You look for more problems to solve from your customers. So as I understand it, you guys added a lot more products to the suite of Mixpanel products. And then I know that there are some challenges with scaling that, and maybe the products didn't stick as much as you're hoping. And what I understand is recently, you moved back to just the single core analytics product. And so I'd love to just hear that journey of what that process was like, what you learned as a product leader and as a company about scaling, expanding, trying to solve a lot of problems, and then coming back to one core straightforward problem.
Vijay Iyengar (07:15):
Mixpanel started in 2009 as provide product analytics to EPD teams. And I think early on, it saw a lot of success because it built this in-house database called Arb, which stands for arbitrary segmentation. And that was necessary because events data, which is the fuel for product analytics, is few orders of magnitude larger than most other types of data that people collect, and so you need a specialized approach to deal with it. And so that I think spurred the first wave of explosive growth, because product analytics was a really burning problem at the time. People were shipping mobile apps like crazy and they needed a solution that could scale, and that was kind of a durable mode for Mixpanel for a while. And I think because we had this SDK that was installed in so many apps and we had this really scalable event collection and analytic interface, it was just natural to expand into a few adjacencies that would leverage those same technologies.
(08:04):
So, the first one was messaging, being able to send targeted messages to users, which is something that's fairly natural, you might want to do, especially if you have an SDK already installed. Yeah. The other aspect that we've added into was data infrastructure and trying to be the single source of truth of data in companies. And what ended up happening was that by 2018, we had this big churn problem. We had something like 40% churn, revenue churn, our core product. And when we dug into, it wasn't that people were churning because they didn't need product analytics anymore. They had the need. They were just churning to competition because we were just not up to the market in terms of the features we had in our core. And when we dug into why that was, it was just that we had a 50% engineering team that was building products across three domains, product analytics, messaging, and data engineering stuff.
(08:52):
Our engineering team was just spread too thin to address all of those core gaps in functionality. And so we made a really hard call at the time. We said the hard no to those two other categories and decided to focus our entire engineering team on closing the gap on product analytics and innovating there. And from a process standpoint, how we operationalize this was we threw away all our planning and all the execution and that we work that we'd planned to do so far, and we did something very simple. We took all the churn reasons that our customer success and sales teams had been painstakingly collecting for years, grouped them by category, which was roughly product features we needed to build, sorted descending by ARR, took the top 10 things and made that our roadmap, just give every engineer direct access to customers and give them a bucket to go work on, which I think goes against about a million product best practices out there of just doing that.
(09:41):
But I think given the context at the time, we needed to optimize for speed, and speed comes when you have extreme clarity on what you want to do and focus. And so we really just optimize for speed in that time. And so in that first year we moved really quickly and we shipped something like a hundred features in that year and closed a lot of gaps. Again, these are all vanity metrics. Measuring number of features doesn't mean anything.
Lenny (10:04):
And what year was this by the way?
Vijay Iyengar (10:06):
This is 2018 to 2019.
Lenny (10:09):
Got it.
Vijay Iyengar (10:09):
Yeah. So, we moved really fast shipping all these features and instantly saw the improvements to win rate and to retention. But one of the cracks that started to emerge was we neglected the holistic design of our product at the time, right? And if you're shipping features that quick leads, you don't have time to stop and think, where does this go, and how does this fit into our overall system architecture? And what started to happen was that we were hitting diminishing returns with some of these features. And not considering the holistic design and consistency meant the reach of every feature was low. You had to rebuild it for every part of the product that we were in. And so at the time we made... We spun up the second stream that was very design led. And I think this was also coincided around the time we adopted Figma, and it's a really broad design at seat at the table of the company, and we just set up this goal to make design one of our key differentiators.
(10:53):
So, this design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step? And then how will users discover them and how do they relate to each other? But I think this realization was born out of the fact that so many great products win or lose based on their architecture. I think Notion, for example, that pages in blocks architecture is so strong, and you can hang so many features off of those core building blocks in a way that has such high impact on region and discovery of those features.
(11:26):
So anyway, we did that in parallel with the.... And continued that grind on core jabs. And so the end result of that phase, which is from 2018 to maybe late 2021, 2022, was our retention went from about 60% to 90%, and our NPS went from 16 to 50. So I think, yeah, there's a lot in there to unpack, but refocusing on the core really helped us achieve those results.
Lenny (11:52):
Got it. Yeah. I have a lot of questions about this. So interesting. So, that phase that you went through where you sorted things by potential ARR, was that the phase of expanding to multiple products or that was post we're going to focus on analytics and go all in there?
Vijay Iyengar (12:06):
Oh, that was post focusing on analytics.
Lenny (12:08):
Okay.
Vijay Iyengar (12:08):
Yeah. Yeah.
Lenny (12:09):
And you're saying that you had a stream of just builds all the features that were lacking that are causing customers to churn, and in parallel, there was a track of let's build this product, such that it all connects and works together well and it's really well thought through long term?
Vijay Iyengar (12:24):
The first thing, I might have made it seem like it was just the buckets were features. We did take the step of turning them into problems and being clear, exposing engineers directly to the customers that had those problems and then invent a solution to solve them. So I mean, loosely there were features involved, but a lot of them were kind of core problems we needed to solve.
Lenny (12:40):
That first approach is so interesting. It's kind of like, yes, we will make more money if we focus on these features. To your point, it ends up being just a bunch of features and products that kind of maybe don't synergize. Looking back, was that a good idea to approach it that way, at least for a while?
Vijay Iyengar (12:54):
It highly depends on your context. In a very competitive context where there are just table stakes features that customers need and that it's been validated by the market, you need to optimize for speed more so than anything else. But it is an approach that outlives it's usefulness pretty fast, and we've put that approach behind us relatively quickly after that phase. And I would actually say that design driven phase was the next phase, where it was, okay, we're not bleeding on the table stakes anymore, but we want to make a holistic product that has high reach, high impact on the features and is actually usable. And so that was I think a follow-on phase that's necessary. Obviously, depending on your particular circumstances and competitive dynamics, you can sequence them differently, but I think it was the right call to just... Sort of the on-call thing again where when you're in trouble, you got to get out of trouble. You can't mow your lawn while your house is on fire. You kind of put out the fire and then deal with everything else.
Lenny (13:47):
Yeah.
Vijay Iyengar (13:47):
So, that's kind of the approach we took.
Lenny (13:49):
What's an example of a feature or product that you launched within that first track? And then what's an example of something that came out of the designer led approach, if anything comes to mind?
Vijay Iyengar (14:00):
I think out of the first track, oh man, there's so many that were just core. We didn't have a good cohorts product at the time, just being able to create behavioral cohorts users and create them from any report that we built, right? And I think that, I mean it's just table stakes and analytics to be able to do that. So, that was one of the first things we built, and it was fairly obvious. There's a lot of other things in more advanced types of funnel analytics and a flows and visualization that was really interactive. I think on the design-led phase, the biggest thing I think was visualization consistency and making our charts interactive in a consistent way across our entire product. And so there's two things that enabled. One was that every time we added a new visualization or a new enhancement to a visualization or how something is sorted in one report, it just instantly applied everywhere.
(14:46):
So, just the reach was multiplied for everything we added. And the other thing is it just made the product more accessible, let us add dark mode. So, it made our visualizations really stunning and really easy to see what the takeaways were. And then every new visualization we added inherited all those benefits.
Lenny (14:59):
I'm trying to think about being at a company that goes through this phase of, "Hey, we're just going to build a bunch of stuff that we know we need." And it feels like hearing it, it's like, "Oh yeah, and then we're just going to make it all look great and connect and work well." I imagine that wasn't planned, and I imagine that wasn't easy to get people to maybe slow down on just building more products and features or push it in a direction where it's all going to make sense. Can you talk at all about what that process was, how hard it was to shift from we're just going to knock through all this checklist of things to let's just bigger, let's slow down, let's spend a lot of time designing?
Vijay Iyengar (15:35):
It was definitely more messy internally than I described it. One of the key junctures was when we had this really talented design team and we were putting them on these very tactical projects that was, frankly, that was very engineering led, right? And design would often come in at the end and be asked like, "Hey, can you just make this look nice and put some pixels on it?" And it's just such a waste of your design team to have them do that. But at the same time, the pace was so high that they didn't have time to come up for air and do anything else. And so there's actually this moment where I was an engineering manager at part of this.
(16:05):
And had a meeting with our BM and our head of design at the time, and we said, "Hey, we can actually do the next three months of projects about any design," which was a kind of controversial thing to say, "but we're doing this so that you can take three months with a set of designers and go think about the system architecture of the product, and we'll wait for that to be done before we do any architectural things that might impact the architecture." And I think that gave designers a bit of breathing room to go do that, just separating them for a bit from the tactical fire. Because what was happening instead was we would get towards the end of the project, bring design in, and they would use each project as an opportunity to squeeze in like, oh, and we can simplify here. And that's just a classic way to blow up scope at the end of the project because there wasn't a dedicated space for design led projects.
(16:48):
And I think that that was kind of a key friction point that we ultimately had to decouple for a bit, and then regroup and say, "Okay, now we'll look what's our strategy," and just take on projects purely for the sake of improving consistency, reach depth of our UX.
Lenny (17:02):
Also, looking back, the process you went through adding a bunch of products to solve more customer problems, something every founder and product team thinks about, when should we add new product lines? When should we expand beyond the core? I'm curious what you take away as a lesson and what you'd advise other founders and companies when it comes to when is the time to expand and think about a new product and a third product and a fourth product?
Vijay Iyengar (17:28):
I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule here. I can just maybe say what made sense and didn't make sense in our context. The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself ripe for disruption in your core because someone else can out invest you in that core. And so if you, you're the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invest everyone else in that core, and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
(18:10):
And the other aspect of that is that those secondary products we took on were in categories of their own. And it's really tempting and you'll often get dragged into accidentally entering another category, and then you'll end up building these bolt-on products that are the best in their category, right? And the adjacent categories for analytics are CDPs or message targeting or feature flagging or something, but there's not that many people that need the sixth best CDP or the eighth best feature flagging or the 10th best message targeting tool. And it ends up being, in aggregate will contribute five to 10% to your revenue, won't seriously accelerate your growth rate, and then takes engineers away from the core product. And so those were the circumstances that we were.
(18:50):
And I think if you're seeing churn to your competitor on your core product and you're not best in class on any of the other ones, then maybe it's time to reevaluate. And then the last thing I'll say there is that it's also 10x more painful than you think to cut mild successes than anything else, and just organizationally painful. And there's teams that have whole roadmaps, and it's a really painful experience, so you have to think really hard before you kick those off.
Lenny (19:18):
That is really, really insightful advice, makes me think about if you bundle good enough solutions, there needs to be kind of this anchored tenant that I will not give this thing up and I'll use the third best version of something else, if you have it. But if you're not that valuable and important, you're not going to convince people to use something because they're competing against the best in every category.
Vijay Iyengar (19:39):
Exactly. Yeah.
Lenny (19:40):
That is really interesting. I've been doing this kind of series on how different companies approach building product and I have a few questions I'd love to ask around the product development process and Mixpanel.
Vijay Iyengar (19:50):
Sure.
Lenny (19:51):
The first is just like, how do you plan? How do you plan? I know it evolves, but just how do you plan currently? How long are your planning cycles? How far ahead do you plan in detail? Do you use OKRs? Maybe let's start there, those three kind of sub-questions.
Vijay Iyengar (20:04):
We have these unsolved problems and analytics that we're going after. For us that’s like, people always want more power, more simplicity, better data trust, faster onboarding, better collaboration, better price performance. And so we largely organize our teams around those problems and those missions. One quick aside there is that some of those problems have attention with each other. Power and simplicity, there's a trade off there, right? And we want one team to own both, so that they're kind of forced to confront that tension and beat that trade off. And so that's kind of how we think about generally our product team, is these cross-functional EPD teams, each of which that's focused on solving these long-lived paired problems for customers [inaudible 00:20:41] our core analysis team focused on that power, simplicity, trade off problem. In terms of planning, the way it works is that we plan on a six month time horizon. And I can talk about our most recent planning cycle actually, because we're just completing it.
Lenny (20:53):
Yeah, let's do it.
Vijay Iyengar (20:54):
Yeah, basically it started out with this strategy memo that our leadership team wrote that basically just conveys this is where we want to go as a company in the next year, and here's how the product team can contribute most of that and just established these key pillars. We shared that with the teams, and they took that and also combined that with all the quantitative and qualitative context they're constantly consuming about the problem they're working on and our customers, and ideated and developed the series of bets for the next six months, which I think are some extent similar to OKRs, where ABET... The anatomy of ABET is that it's problem we want to solve, our hypothesis on the solution, and then some plan to win, some plan to actually get there and a way to measure that you got there.
(21:32):
And I think one of the unique things that we did relative to other companies that do planning is... I think it usually is sort of this W process of there's the strategy memo, and then teams generate bets and there's a review, and then they go back and I iterate and then they finalize. And we kind of collapsed the middle part of the W where myself and our head of design actually spend time with each of the teams actually ideating on the bets and participating in the solution discovery process, going into the jam sessions and adding fig must keys ourselves with ideas and thoughts on things, which we did because we aren't a huge product team, and we are not going to do 50 things and a half. We're going to do maybe 10 to 12 things.
(22:12):
And so that's enough that we don't... We can do something that doesn't scale if that enables high bandwidth communication between us and the teams. And it ends up being more messy and unstructured ABET in that phase because we're in there contributing ideas as well. But by the end of it, I think the team leaves feeling both more competent in their bets because there's more thought that's gone into it, and then more aligned top to bottom line why we made certain decisions. And so I think that that's one thing that's different. And then we conclude that process with the roadshow where we presented the rest of the company, and then get their feedback as well.
Lenny (22:41):
How long is this process generally?
Vijay Iyengar (22:43):
The teams did pre-work for a couple of weeks, like two weeks in December, and then we did a two week sort of sprint on solutioning and ideation in January, the first two weeks of January.
Lenny (22:53):
Awesome. And what's the end result of planning for each team? Did they deliver a document with, here's our strategy, here's the big bets, here's a roadmap? Is there a template you pass around? How do you get to a thing that people share and present and comment on?
Vijay Iyengar (23:10):
Yeah, I think there's basically three artifacts that are kind of linked to each other. So, the first is we use Notion, and so we have a database in notion called bets, which is where each page in the database is [inaudible 00:23:22]. And that has a template, yeah. So, it's kind of roughly what I described with a few more sections of what problem we're solving? What's the evidence of demand? What's the region impact of this problem? How do we know we're successful? And then what's the key driving hypothesis behind the solution? And then a rough line. And then that's tied with a presentation that's kind of like a tight summary of that that has one slide per bet, and then is also tied with more of an execution focused, how do we sequence and staff this thing and eliminate dependencies, which the engineering team contributes to. So, I think those are the three artifacts that are linked together.

(25:08):
I know you have some insights on prioritization and some strong opinions on how to prioritize. Can you talk a bit about that and how you advise your product teams to prioritize?
Vijay Iyengar (25:17):
One really common framework in prioritization is RICE, reach, impact, confidence, effort. And I think it's simple and fairly robust, which is generally good qualities of a framework. But one of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets, really innovative things. And we encountered this on one of our teams early last year were we just RICE'd everything, all the ideas, and a lot of the high reach, high impact things ended up at the bottom because confidence and effort were just so murky for them, as they should be typically for high reach, high impact ideas.
(25:55):
And so one exercise that we push our teams on is just ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas with engineers and designers in the room committed to actually trying to solve them. Give it a fair shot. And you'll often find if you spend a week on that set of ideas, you can get pretty far in understanding the confidence and the effort. You can probably find a higher confident lower effort way to do them. Then add the C and E back in, and then RICE as usual. And the goal is to end up with a reasonable mix of innovative bets, incremental bets, and then ones that are technical debt or product debt that you need to address.
Lenny (26:31):
I usually just cut out the C myself. I find that it's not that powerful. Do you do this in a Google Sheet? Do you use this in Notion? How do you actually recommend teams do this prioritization, or just eyeball it?
Vijay Iyengar (26:43):
I'm not super opinionated on the exact tools that teams use. I think this is a team local exercise typically, but most teams use Notion and just simple tables or databases in Notion-
Lenny (26:51):
Sweet.
Vijay Iyengar (26:52):
... work fine for this. I think the other thing on prioritization that's always tricky is estimation. And every engineer will value you estimates are all lies, and if you say it'll take eight weeks, it'll take eight months. But I think the core problem with estimation is you're asked to estimate things before what the thing is, and it's just a strange output to be expected to produce. And one approach that I found really interesting is from this book called Shape Up by Basecamp, which this idea of appetite overestimates, where instead of making the estimate an output of planning, you make the time box or an appetite the input, and you say, "We want to solve X problem and we're willing to invest six weeks solving that problem."
(27:31):
The obvious question there is how do you pick that time window? It just seems arbitrary. And so the base camp people suggest just pick six weeks for everything, and they're really austere about if you can't scope hammer something down to six weeks, you're doing it wrong, which I think is... It can work and has a lot of benefits if you creates a rhythm in your company, but one approach I found that works better is pick a reasonable sounding appetite and just explore the two to three options around it. Pick six weeks, and then say, "What would we do differently if we only had four weeks or eight weeks?" And you'll kind of naturally find the efficient frontier of cost and impact, and then align on that. And the important thing is that you check in after that time period and say, "Is there any new information that's just we should continue? Did we uncover the biggest risks, and are we just on the long tail of things?" And actually be honest with yourself about that. I think that's important regardless of what framework you use.
Lenny (28:23):
I really like that. So, is that how you actually operate, you create a time box, we have four weeks for this project, whatever we get done, we ship whatever we don't, we push out?
Vijay Iyengar (28:30):
We operated that way in engineering, particularly on the infrastructure side, because we have this series of projects that would just take forever, and the longer it takes, the longer it's going to take. And so we've done that exercise quite a bit. I'd say more on the more engineering heavy projects than others, but we're starting to adopt it more in the product side as well. The main exercise we've taken on the product side is more the consider, what would you do differently with different time boxes approach?
Lenny (28:56):
Just a thought exercise.
Vijay Iyengar (28:58):
Yeah, it's a good thought exercise. Then it just forces everyone to truly score the requirements. Critical, nice to have, is nice, but really if in two weeks, you're going to get pulled off to do something completely different, what would be a complete solution that addresses the core problem. And it forces you to peel the meat of the problem in first, as opposed to just doing the things that are surrounding it.
Lenny (29:17):
That's cool. I really like that. I've done that myself. I'm curious if anyone ever does the shape up process for real or it's just like we will ship anything that is ready within six weeks and not actually have specific deadlines or kind of concrete goals of products they need to ship in specific ways.
Vijay Iyengar (29:32):
Yeah. Well, I think the shape up process, if you run it all the way. They do... Their idea is that you can actually predict on a six week time horizon. So, you can just hammer down scope to something that is complete. It needs to be complete. It can't be milestone one that's like a half baked thing in six weeks, which I think that rigor... The rigor they applied to that across the board, you need to do it all the way. You can't adopt the process halfway. I think the is the challenge. Otherwise you end up with people shipping milestone one and then moving on, which is not the complete product.
Lenny (30:01):
Makes sense. A couple more questions around how you build product. You mentioned that you have a unique approach to keeping product teams close to customers. And I'm curious what you've learned there, what you found to be helpful and just kind of keeping product teams close to your customers.
Vijay Iyengar (30:15):
I think this is one thing that is something we invested in pretty early on at Mixpanel. Actually around that time, in 2018, when we refocused on our core product, one of our sales engineers, Aaron, built this automation where he piped all these customer gaps that we got that were reported by our customer success and sales teams, piped that into Slack and just a feed. And what this created was this culture where all engineers and designers could consume that raw feed of direct points of customer with no gatekeeper, no process to access it, no pre-aggregation, right? And I think this scale's pretty far. At a product team of our scale and with our reach of customers, we don't get so much feedback that someone couldn't read it in 20 minutes every day. And for four or five years in engineering, every day I would read all the gaps that we got, and many engineers would do that.
(31:04):
And one of the rituals that it's enabled is we'll find that engineers will go into that channel and react with a message with an email emoji, which means I'm going to email this customer and find out more, right? And they'll just email the customer and say, "Hey, I'm the engineer that built this feature. I saw you said this specific thing. Can you tell me more? I'd love to understand." They ask the five why's, and then they improve the product on their own. And I think that culture is just so important, and it just empowers all engineers and designers to think a PM a little bit, which I think takes a little bit of a load off on the PM to be the gatekeeper of all that information.
(31:39):
And then over time, we've evolved it quite a bit as our data stack stack's involved. So, we now not just take customer requests, but we take things that are posted on Twitter and NPS survey feedback and win loss notes from our competitive deals and pipe them both into Slack and into Notion so that we can both get the realtime feed, and then we can sort and aggregate and tag things accordingly. But the key artifact of this is that it's all open. There's no gatekeeper behind that process.
Lenny (32:04):
That sounds both amazing and wild. Do you still allow engineers just to email customers and ask them questions about this stuff, or is that harder to do it as you've grown?
Vijay Iyengar (32:12):
Oh no, we still allow that. Yeah.
Lenny (32:14):
Wow, that's awesome.
Vijay Iyengar (32:15):
One nice thing about the stack actually, the data stack, is that... So, basically all these feeds information land in our data warehouse, which is BigQuery. And from there, they're pushed out via a reverse CTL tool we use called Census to Slack and Notion that make the note code. But one of the benefits of that is that we can enrich all of these feeds with who's the account? What's their ARR? Who's the CSM? And all that other contact information. So, it's usually not an engineer's blindly reaching out to a customer without letting a CSM know if it's a million dollar account or something. The idea is just trust them with that context, and they can tag the right people and make the right call on that.
Lenny (32:50):
I'm so curious how that gets prioritized and how PMs are looped into all that, but we don't have to get too deep in that. That's a really cool process. I haven't seen that before. Our engineers were just emailing customers, digging into questions and problems.
Vijay Iyengar (33:01):
The trap of course is what you just called out is you can't be reacting to everything all the time. And certainly if you ship a redesign, the first two weeks of that, there's going to be a bunch of feedback that's like, I hate this. Go back. And I think that's sort of an organizational muscle you have to build, balance the reaction, and that's just a thing we've had to practice doing, but I think the trade offs are worth it.
Lenny (33:20):
Awesome. One last question along these lines, can you just talk about the tools you use, the SaaS products you use to run your product team for collaboration, communication, notes, docs. You mentioned Notion as an example.
Vijay Iyengar (33:31):
I think our stack is actually fairly standard these days. So, we have Slack, Zoom for communication, Notion for docs and any long form writing, and it's a [inaudible 00:33:42] database, and Figma and FigJam for design and whiteboarding. I think what's actually more interesting is our data stack and the productivity we get out of that. I briefly touched on this, where basically all of our data gets EPL'd out of all the systems we have, lands in BigQuery, gets joined and modeled, and then pushed out via census to all the other tools in our stack. And I think that's been a huge productivity unlock because you can build internal tools with very little code. If you can write SQL, you can build an internal tool basically, and that pushes information to the teams that need it. And so that, I think, just has unlocked a lot of these types of things like automating qualitative signals with no code in a reliable way.
(34:22):
And then if someone like, "Oh, can I get ARR on this?" Yeah, sure it takes two seconds to do that. So, I think that data stack has been a huge productivity unlock for us.
Lenny (34:29):
Awesome. Have you guys shared that anywhere online, just to show kind of the stack you guys have built?
Vijay Iyengar (34:33):
We have a couple blog posts that talks about our stack for... We use this both for our PLG infrastructure and our product, let sales, defining a PQL and alerting a new user who fits that criteria, but then we also use it for internal tools. We have a few blog posts on that topic.
Lenny (34:48):
Sweet. We'll follow up and include some of that in the show notes.
Vijay Iyengar (34:51):
Yeah, definitely.
Lenny (34:53):
Final line of questioning, you're one of the smartest people in the world on product analytics heading product for Mixpanel. I'm curious what you think most people get wrong when they're setting up product analytics for their site, their product, their company.
Vijay Iyengar (35:08):
It's maybe a bit of a hot take because I think so many people-
Lenny (35:11):
There we go.
Vijay Iyengar (35:12):
Yeah, so many people still do this, but I think the biggest mistake is setting up analytics using client side SDKs, client side tracking. So, web and mobile SDKs, putting a mixpanel.track or segment.track in your web app or your mobile apps. And reason it's a hot take is that for many people that's product analytics and SDK tracking are synonymous. They're like, "All right, Mixpanel means SDK, I have to put an SDK in my web and mobile app. But that's a mistake because it... We've just seen time and time again, it leads to poor data quality and difficulty to maintain that data. So, the problem on web is, just due to app blockers and other unreliable things, in the JavaScript world, you end up dropping 20 to 30% of your events, and so it just doesn't match your internal databases.
(35:55):
And then on mobile there's two problems. The first is that you have to reinvent tracking for both iOS and Android because it's two different languages and two different platforms, generally speaking. And so you end up with many duplicate events that semantically mean the same thing, but are just different because of the two platforms, and you might have two teams owning that. And the second issue, which is I think even worse, is that you are kind of beholden to clients updating their mobile app to get to the latest version that has your latest tracking. So if you want to add new tracking, it'll only apply to people at the latest version and beyond. Whereas yet all of your old tracking, whether it's broken or you made a mistake, is still out there in the wild, and so you're constantly getting events that are old and broken.
(36:32):
And so what we recommend instead, and that we've seen a lot more customers adopt recently is just track events from your servers instead of your clients. And that has three benefits. One, it's instantly cross platform. Web and mobile and TV and whatever other platform, they're all going to go through your servers, so you instantly get a hundred percent reach. The second is it's in an environment you control. So if you want to update tracking, you can update it and updates for a hundred percent of users. And then the third thing is that... And this is I think maybe unintuitive, but it's true, is that engineers have been tracking events from servers forever. It's called logs, right? And events are just logs where they user ID in them. And so they don't need to deal with learning a new SDK and dealing with all of that. They just have to track logs that have some structure and a user ID in them. They're tracking events.
(37:18):
And so if it's easier for the developer, it'll get done in a higher quality way. So, I think the really simple advice there is just start tracking events from your servers instead of from your clients. And if you need to supplement it later on with context that's only on the client, you can add that on later, but server side should be the default.
Lenny (37:34):
Maybe a last question is just what's changed most and how companies work with analytics in the past few years? And then just where do you think things are going in the space of analytics?
Vijay Iyengar (37:43):
Yeah, so I think one huge trend is the rise of the data warehouse. So these are Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and they're really scalable and they speak this SQL standard, which has led to this explosion of tools that have emerged around them and make it really easy and cheap to load data into the data warehouse, and then also easy to push data out of the data warehouse by tools that can just do that. And this has a few implications. So, the first is that the data warehouse becomes the center of gravity for all data in your company. Whether it's product marketing and sales data, they all land there. And I think that's really valuable today in this product led growth world, and a lot of incus filled my bad. But from a data standpoint, that means all these teams need to be operating off of the same version of the truth, and that version of the truth is sitting in the warehouse, and it just needs to be joined correctly.
(38:33):
The second thing in terms of where things are going is the events, a time series of users at this action at this time, are the universal data model for analytics. And the reason for that is every action, every interaction a customer has, whether it's with your sales team, like a gong call, or with your marketing team, they clicked on that or viewed marketing article or their product, which is more well known, those are all events. They can all be modeled as events. And it's super granular, super intuitive as a way to understand what people are doing. And it's really powerful, because oftentimes you want to ask questions about sequences of events, right? Which user has spent this much time on my pricing page and then looked at three developer docs? That's probably a user I want to reach out to. So many things can be modeled off of that.
(39:17):
And so I think data warehouse is becoming the loading dock for all this data, which can be very easily modeled this events, but it's not a very great analytical tool for events because SQL is optimized for rows and tables and joints, and not events and sequences of events and segmentations of events. And so one of the things that we're spending a lot of time thinking about is how do we get that really rich, trusted, comprehensive dataset from the data warehouse into a tool that's optimized from the UI down to the data model for events, because that unlocks really fast intuitive exploration of data on dataset that people already have in trust? So, that's, I think, one of the big trends we're excited about and what we see as the future.
Lenny (39:56):
Interesting. And you think Mixpanel is in a good place to help people do that? Is that how see this, there's something that companies like yours will help people solve, or is this something everyone's going to have to figure out for themselves, or there's like a whole new class of startups launching to help them make the mess out of data warehouses?
Vijay Iyengar (40:11):
No, there's always a new class of startups joining in the analytics space. It's never dull moment. Yeah, I think this is something that we are looking to solve, because I mean, analytics only as good as the data. And if people are already collecting great data in the warehouse, I mean we integrate with the warehouse really well, then we get access to that good data. Increasingly, what we've been seeing is that companies like in the reverse ETL phase, like Census and Hightouch are effectively reinventing the CDP reinventing, data movement tool like segment on top of the data warehouse. And so really our strategy there is just tightening our integration with those tools. And we've seen just huge growth and people using their data warehouse as the source for events, not adding SDK tracking anywhere, and just saying, "I already have events sitting here. I trust all of them. They're from all parts of my business. Why can't I do analytics on my support tickets and my gong calls just as easily as I can do it about my user behavior." And so I think that's something we're seeing and we're investing in.
Lenny (41:04):
Awesome. Anything else you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Vijay Iyengar (41:09):
Yeah, we opened talking about the transition from engineering to product, and I think one of the things that's just been really fruitful in my career, both on the engineering side and product side, is just adopting that product mindset and getting closer to customers, consuming the raw feed of customer context, taking every opportunity to talk to them. And I'm really excited to see things like this podcast and your newsletter and other forums for engineers to also develop that product mindset then and get closer to customers, because I think long term, that just means better products and services at lower and lower prices, which is just innovation. So, I'm really excited to see more of that in the world.
Lenny (41:45):
Here, here. With that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got six quick questions for you. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast. Whatever comes to mind, just share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good?
Vijay Iyengar (41:57):
Sure. Let's do it.
Lenny (41:58):
Okay. What are couple books that you recommend most to other people?
Vijay Iyengar (42:02):
On the business book standpoint, there's this book called The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. And it's kind of an old book, but I like it because it's sort of written in this fast-paced thriller model. It's like a fiction book, but it's about this idea of the theory of constraints, finding constraints in a system and how you can remove them to improve productivity. So, I found it's just a fun read, and also really insightful non-technical books that I recommend to folks, particularly those that live in SF, which is Cool Gray City of Love by Gary Kamiya, who is a longtime SF president. And it just goes into the history and the communities, and even the geography of San Francisco, and I've just discovered so many little pockets in the city from reading that book, so it's something I recommend to people who live in San Francisco.
Lenny (42:46):
What's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than this podcast?
Vijay Iyengar (42:50):
I'll do non-tech one for this. So, I'm a huge fan of the show The West Wing, and so there's this podcast called The West Wing Weekly that goes into each episode of the West Wing and brings in actors from the show, as well as folks from government to talk about each episode, and it's just a delight to listen to if you love The West Wing.
Lenny (43:06):
Wait, so they go back to the old show, The West Wing and talk about old episodes with politicians?
Vijay Iyengar (43:11):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:12):
That's cool.
Vijay Iyengar (43:12):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:13):
Wow.
Vijay Iyengar (43:14):
Exactly. So, the show's over. The podcast is over.
Lenny (43:18):
Oh, okay.
Vijay Iyengar (43:18):
You have all seven seasons, but I think it started in 2016 or 2015 or something.
Lenny (43:22):
Got it. So cool. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Vijay Iyengar (43:27):
Pretty mainstream TV tastes. So, I really enjoyed We Crushed and Severance. Those are two good shows I really enjoyed last year.
Lenny (43:35):
Awesome. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're interviewing?
Vijay Iyengar (43:39):
I'm a big fan of open-ended questions, and so one of the questions I ask in the behavioral interview at the start is, walk me through the story of you from college to now, or high school to now, if they're a more junior candidate. And couple interesting things here, interesting to see where people spend most of their time talking and where they don't, and also how they describe the other people on that journey. And do they use a standard framework to describe everyone, or do they go into each person uniquely? So, just tons of follow up questions from that.
Lenny (44:09):
Final question is, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?
Vijay Iyengar (44:14):
Got a lot of inspiration from Gibson Biddle and his product strategy medium thing. And in particular, there's a piece on proxy metrics and the shape of metrics you should use, which I found is a really... The way he frames it is a really elegant way to measure, reach and impact at the same time of your metrics. And then also a big fan of Shishir from Coda, specifically his essays liaison on [inaudible 00:44:37] questions, framing problems, and the one on marginal churn contribution. It's really interesting.
Lenny (44:42):
Amazing. Both guests of this podcast and people I love. Great choices. Vijay, this was awesome. Thank you so much for joining me. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about what you're up to? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Vijay Iyengar (44:57):
I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. I think my handles will be in the show notes. Not super active there, but I definitely check DMs and would love to connect on either of those. And then how can listeners be useful to me? Yeah, I mean, ultimately at Mixpanel, we're building a product for product teams. So, two things. If you haven't used Mixpanel in the last four years, we've changed a lot, as I've described on the pod, so check it out, and happy to take any feedback to help us improve the product.
Lenny (45:23):
Awesome, Vijay, thank you so much.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:07):
I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things. What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:22):
Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc? You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
I'm curious what you found most impedes people's career growth.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:37):
How you view change, whether you are focusing on things you control, and third is how you see yourself. The moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):

Vikrama, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:00):
Thank you for inviting me, Lenny. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:03):
So as you know and hopefully as listeners know, I'm on this quest to meet the most insightful product leaders from all over the world and your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia. And you're also the third guest from Gojek, so there's definitely something in the water over there and I want to talk about that. To just dive right in, you have a very strong reputation for building incredibly strong product talent and also design talent, and also helping people transition from other roles into product management, which a lot of people listening to this podcast dream to do. So I'm going to ask a bunch of questions around this area. How does that sound?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:47):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
Okay. First question is just when you think back to the people that have done best in the product management role and have had a rapid career rise, what are some of the most common traits or behaviors or habits that you find in these people?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:05:05):
Over the last decade and a half, I've had the opportunity to work with some really strong product managers, learn from strong product managers, and some of them have had rapid career growth. When I was younger and I was starting off, I used to think it's all about the product. If you've got a really cool product to work on, your growth's guaranteed. And if you got really a product which no one cares about or a stream which no one cares about, then your growth is going to be slightly slower. But as I started seeing more and more product managers at their craft, I saw that working on a cool product area is not the only thing. In fact, sometimes some product managers would come back and complain that despite their product doing really well, they've not really grown.

(00:05:51):
And while some other product managers whose product didn't have the impact really grew. And as I started looking at it and as I started making notes, as I started talking to other product leaders, what I discovered was that the really strong product managers who were also growing in their careers did some things differently. And based on that, I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things, and I call it three W's. So what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? The really strong product managers are good at usually two of the three things. The ones who rise and when they are rising, they are performing well on all the three access. So if you would like, let's talk a little bit more about each one of these W's.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
Yeah, I would love to. I love that you put the word what at the top and that makes it the three W's, which is clever because I find even if the acronym is not necessary, it's really helpful to help people remember so I totally respect what you did there. So the three is what you produce, what you bring to the table and what your operating model is. Is that right?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:09):
Yes, absolute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
Okay, cool. Yeah, let's talk about these.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:11):
So what you produce, a lot of people index on the impact while and they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy. While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on.

(00:08:14):
And when you start figuring out which outcomes are necessary, that is when you move to the leadership and directional areas. The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:20):
So highlighting one insight here is that a lot of advice you hear about how to do well in your career, which you pointed out at the beginning here, is it's not just not immediately drive impact. That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:09:51):
Absolutely. So outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:54):
The way I think about what you're describing, which I actually 100% agree with, is when you're starting out in your careers, execution is where you need to deliver. People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:25):
Absolutely. So focus on outputs at the start of your careers and don't forget outputs even when you grow in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
So along those lines, just to close the thread on this idea, it's still helpful if you work on something that does have impact that matters, right? How important is that? And you said that you've seen successful product managers work on things that aren't as impactful and still do really well, but I guess would your advice be tried [inaudible 00:11:52] be in a place that is going to drive more impact versus it's not actually that important in the early career?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:58):
So I'll give you my example. In one of my previous roles, there were two product areas that were important for the organization. My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
I love that. Yeah, basically when you're just starting out, just execute well, execute smoothly, ship things on time. I'm going to say a few things, but I'm curious what else comes to mind here of just what does good output look like? Is it do things that are helpful to your team and manager, ship things on time, bug-free, have a clean road map, everyone's aligned behind, [inaudible 00:13:11] deadlines, things like that. I guess what else along those lines should people be like, "Okay, here's what I should be doing to have good outputs?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:13:16):
Some of the things that I think are useful. So first, what's output? Output is something which is very tangibly defined, which doesn't take too much of your time, effort, and energy to visualize and think and strategize over and you are able to quickly get moving on. Go and ask your product leader, go and ask other leaders on what are the areas they are blocked on. Sometimes they will be blocked on, "Hey, I need to prepare this brief for this particular summit", "I need to prepare this particular slide for a leadership review", "I need to prepare a review, I need to prepare a review which has to be done with the legal." You can volunteer and definitely own and deliver the first drafts of those even if the final draft is not something that you own. That's a simple example of an output, which I feel a lot of people miss because they want to be focusing on the bigger strategic pieces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
It's basically be useful. That's the way I always like to talk about this, just like your job as a PM is be useful, make your team more effective, help your company be more successful. Just find ways to be useful to everyone around you.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:14:27):
Absolutely. And be useful in doing the small things which make an impact and also contribute to your learning versus being useful in areas which you think the mini CEO should be working on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Right. There's all this talk about being an empowered product manager, building empowered product teams. I think there's an important nuance. When you're just starting out, you haven't earned the right to inform strategy and vision people. Why would people follow you at this point? We just need to get stuff done, so that comes over time.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:01):
Absolutely. And it's not just when you are starting off or when you are young. Even with if you are senior and you're starting off with a new team, even if you're starting with a new company, you need to have that mindset. And sometimes you will not know the best. And we'll talk more about how to, what is your operating model, which is how you work with others. It's a very, very important thing for you to know that you are one part of the cog wheel, you're not the entire wheel yourself. And a lot of the folklore around product managers can make you confused, especially when you're starting off in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:40):
I love it. Okay, let's keep going. Number two.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:43):
Number two is what you bring to the table. Now, I think how I describe that is what is your impact on impact? So the first access is impact, but you also need to have an impact on impact. And this is what I had missed a lot in my early career, that you put the coolest product areas, your product area is successful and that automatically guarantees your growth. It doesn't. You have to also show that yes, you were a useful contributor to having that particular impact. The simplest thing on this is that is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? Are you making sure that you are deriving from the strategy that has been shaped or you're constantly just pushing back on the strategy? Similarly, you also how you are drafting the north stars, how you are working on the experiments, how you're working on the data, how you're working on the metrics.

(00:16:43):
All these things take time, effort, and energy. And I know there is some literature and there are some operating models where people are working only at strategy levels while all of these execution of these artifacts is being done by some other people. I don't think, especially when you are starting off, that's a very, very good thing. Even when you are mid-senior, I don't think that's a very, very good thing. You have to have to be able to produce these artifacts which are product artifacts. Even if there are people in strategy creating their artifacts, even if design is coming up with a design brief, you need to have a cohesive product strategy or product PRD and work backwards from PRD and product knows yourself. These things are important to show you are progressing on four pillars, which is data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy.

(00:17:41):
Product managers constantly are evaluated on this when you interview, but you also have to demonstrate these on the jobs. And the best way to demonstrate these is through the artifacts, through the notes that you are sending. So you must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on. For a lot of product managers, when I ask, "Hey, I was working on this very impactful area. I'm not able to have the impact on my career, what is missing?" And when I go and ask, "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems?" Usually, you'll find something or the other missing.

(00:18:31):
In cases that those are bad, you will find that the pre-iteration planning, pre-sprint plannings are not running properly. You will find that the Jira storyboards are very empty and there's just a title in the subject and nothing gets described and so on. So you'll miss all these pieces. So these are the things which you bring to the table and it's very, very important that you work on these aspects as well. Finally, we have what's your operating model, which I feel is the most important thing which you have to have to focus if you are going from mid-senior to senior level. This is essentially about communication, collaboration, organizational skills and community skills.

(00:19:16):
And across product managers, again, because of the folklore of mini CEO and others, I see that a lot of people get carried away in the way they operate as product managers with other stakeholders. There are three tenets that I define in working well as a product manager with others. Number one is raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with. Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself. And finally, you are in charge of getting the decisions made and not making all the decisions yourself. I think as long as you follow these three tenets, you will have a successful relationship across stakeholders. These three tenets are easy to say, but they become very, very hard to embody and display on a day-to-day basis. But this is essentially going to be your struggle no matter at what level of product management you are operating at in your career or within your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
First of all, can you just repeat them? Because I think this is... Essentially, it's like a mantra that PMs can think back to of, "Am I doing these things?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:20:36):
So the three things which are very important for product managers to work with others and other stakeholders are raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with, bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself, and be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
I like this list a lot. It reminds me, there's this product leader I worked with who their team got pushed to do a bunch of stupid stuff. And he realized later that, "Hey, it's actually my job to have pushed back on doing this stuff." He was the head of product for this business unit and he realized, "Oh, I see. That's actually what I should be doing now that I'm in this role." And you sometimes forget that one, you have that influence. And two, that's something you should be doing.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:21:33):
Absolutely, absolutely. It's always within your control and it's always the things that are within your control that you should be controlling rather than focusing on the things that are not within your control and obsessing about those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I'm so aligned with the way you think about all these things. Coming back to the second actually, just to give people something they can do with this trait. So the way I think about what you described, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting it, is there's a detail-oriented-ness, high quality-ness to the way that you should be crafting all the documents/artifacts you're creating, your one-pagers/PRDs, your roadmaps, your strategy docs, just like they should be really high quality. So along those lines, if you're an ICPM trying to get better at this stuff, how have you found is the best way to level up in these things? Is it working with your manager and getting feedback? Is it peers? What helps somebody get better at the quality and yeah, the quality of these documents?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:22:34):
What you bring to the table is one of the most misunderstood attributes and aspects of product management. On one end, you could get around and say, "Here is my PRD, here is my JIRA board, here are my stories, here is my pre-sprint planning or pre-iteration planning document" and go. It's not just about the spread and the width of the things that you're doing, but it's also about the depth of those things as well. Some product managers, what they bring to the table is arguments, what they bring to the table are debates, what they bring to the table are pushbacks, while others are able to channelize the questions, channelize the inputs, channelize the direction and convert that into strategic choices which can then shape discussions, which can then shape direction. Be the latter and you will rise faster in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
So you have these three buckets of what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is, the three W's. So let try to summarize and see what I missed and then we'll move on. So one is just focus on executing, getting things done that are helpful to your team, your company, your manager, and focus on just getting stuff out. Not so much in necessarily in strategy. Even when you're a manager and a leader and a VP, just like you're still responsible for producing things, not just telling people and being wise. Two, what you bring to the table, my takeaway here is produce high quality artifacts that raise the bar.

(00:24:05):
The way I think about this is as a PM, you want to have this aura of I got this. People put something on your plate, you want to feel like Lenny's got this, I'm not going to have to worry. It's going to be forgotten and I know it's going to be done well. And then the third piece is this idea of an operating model. Basically just make sure decisions are being made. It's not about you that you're pushing back on bad ideas. Is there anything else I missed before we move on?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:24:31):
No. I think the art of pushback is another important factor because if you're pushing back a lot and the way you are pushing back matters a lot as well. Just don't be someone who's seen as an obstacle and a hindrance and as someone who's just very difficult to work with, but rather see as someone who's able to actually add value to whatever your leader, your stakeholders, your product area demands and you are able to advance the product and the direction and execution forward. Once you do that, I think keeping that as the intent and ensuring that your team is getting unblocked and not getting to do work on anything which is stupid or is likely to be changed, then you've really got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:23):
Do you have any advice for how to pushback in a way, the way you describe it is not to be difficult to work with or without seeking importance? I guess is there words or phrases or approaches you found are effective for pushing back against ideas that you disagree with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:25:38):
What I've seen that people who do pushback very successfully and are still considered not difficult to work with, they are also able to bring the tempo of the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional space. I think that's such a useful skill and I sometimes am guilty of operating on a slightly emotional note, which is useful. Sometimes you need a war cry, you need a high pitch, you need execution on war footing. All that is fine, but it's only fine in some cases. In other cases, it's always very important that you're able to bring it down to the logical space so that a logical and a little more equal footing of the discussion can happen. And a lot of this is something that leaders need to ensure is happening, but product managers and product leaders who are working with executives who are able to bring this tempo down and bring it to a little more logical space will also do far better in their careers and they'll also have a lot more rapid career growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
So let's talk about the flip side of rapid career growth, which is career growth that stalls. And I'm curious what you've found most impedes people's career growth. What do PMs do that shoot themselves in the foot and slow their career? Any pitfalls do you find are important to try to watch out for?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:27:15):
I think part of it is on a lot of us in product leadership space. We've not done a very good job in defining rubrics, growth frameworks and so on. But even in places where growth frameworks exist, like three W's, what I've seen is that clean mindset shifts and changes can enable faster growth, but those mindset and changes also can hinder your growth, right? So the first thing is whether you are focusing on things you control or whether you're focusing on things that are beyond your control. Second, what's your relationship with change? And third is how you see yourself. The third is very, very powerful and we'll talk about that as well. The first is what you control. If you drew an access of what you control and what you cannot control, as you're starting your career, most of the work that you're doing is in what you control, right?

(00:28:15):
You are very obsessed with feedback, you're very obsessed with, "Okay, can I do this?" "Can I do this?" "Okay, I'll probably not do this. I'll probably do this", and so on. You're not worrying about the overall corporate strategy, you're not looking at what the competitors are doing, what is their market cap and all those things. You're focused a lot on your craft, you're focused on a lot on your output and you're focused on how you are growing. As you start becoming mid-senior, I see the conversation shifts from what can I do, how am I learning, how am I growing, to why is the organization not doing this for me? Why can that stakeholder not change this thing about themselves? Why do I not get to work on projects like this? Things which start going outside your control. And it is very, very important that you keep your focus no matter what stage of career you get into what you can control.

(00:29:16):
And again, it's easy to say that everything in universe should be in your control. It doesn't happen like that, but a large number of things that impact your career are within your control. And go back to the three W's that we spoke about, what you work on, what you produce or what do you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? And there is tons to do on data, tons to do on technology, tons to do on communication, collaboration, design and research, strategy and community. And you can spend years and years and years crafting those things. Focus on those things, growth will happen at every single stage. The second aspect of it is your relationship with change. Again, when you are younger, when you're starting off, rate of change is crazy. You are growing almost every six months. You are picking up skills and experimentation, you're picking up skills in how to analyze.

(00:30:15):
You're picking up skills in how to work with different kind of stakeholders. And since the rate of change of your skills is high, your rate of growth is also high. Again, as you start becoming mid-senior, I start seeing conversations on, "Okay, maybe I should not do that. Maybe I should not take on this product. I don't know what it means for my career. I don't know what it means for my growth" and so on. So your rate of change slows down. So it's very important that as you get to mid-senior level, you are constantly checking on what you can do to keep increasing your rate of change. And one of the simplest things that you can do is if you think you are four on data, figure out who. And you may be four on data out of five in data. Within your organization, start benchmarking yourself with the best in the industry.

(00:31:13):
You'll automatically see that your scale drops and as your scale drops, you start seeing what you need to improve and do. If you start seeing that on communication and collaboration, you're reaching four out of five within the PMR, start mapping yourself to other stakeholders in other functions. Again, your score will fall in your eyes and you will start figuring out what are the things that you can do as well. So keep your focus on rate of change and rate of growth will automatically take care of itself. Sometimes it also involves changing your team or even changing your company, but those should be the last results. There are significant things that you can do within that as well. One of the final things that I see which limits you, especially as you start growing in your career and you reach mid-senior levels is how you see yourself.

(00:32:04):
I see a lot of product... And I've been guilty of that. When I see that a lot of product managers, that's included me at some stage, doing these things, people will come back and say, "Oh, I am a very high agency PM" or, "I'm a very collaborative PM." Earlier on, I used to think that okay, I need to give this kind of work to these product managers. I need to fit them with these kind of team, these kind of work areas, these kind of opportunities. But then I started understanding these things are not just signaling, they are also anti-signaling. They are like, "Oh, I'm high agency. So it's sometimes okay if I'm little brash, if I cut corners somewhere, if I sometimes come across as a little rude to some people" and so on, right?

(00:32:55):
Similarly, if I'm seen as a hyper-collaborative person, so it's okay if sometimes I'm not very decisive, if I'm not moving fast and so on because I'm this kind of a PM. So it's very important that you check for what are the stories that you're telling yourself because those stories are defining you at a basic level, which is then very hard to correct through frameworks and structures. So figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well, and then correct those stories. And the moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
Wow, there's so much meat and wisdom in what you just shared. I want to go in so many different directions. Maybe just to follow on this last thread, did you go through something like that yourself where you have this sense of yourself that hindered you? Okay, awesome. You're nodding your head, if you're not on YouTube. Can you share that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:33:57):
Yeah. So I'll give an example of when I joined Gojek. The very first thing that I learned in my career was SQL and Oracle. And I was very proud of the fact that my data skills are awesome and I know several frameworks and I know several tools and so on. And when I joined Gojek and I saw one of your guests, Crystal, and I saw the work that she was doing and her team was doing and I just immediately was like, "Yeah, no, this is not... I'm nowhere near", right? And similarly, I also thought that my communication skills are really good and my product strategy skills are very good, but then I worked with people like Dito and people like Sidu who was so good at their craft that it challenged me to see that okay, what is it that I am missing? What is it that I am doing wrong?

(00:34:57):
And it auto-calibrated me in my eyes on where it was, but that also created a hunger in me that this is what I need to fix. And I immediately corrected my assessment of myself that I'm not the strongest product manager on data. I'm not the one who knows all the strategy pieces or even strategy frameworks or how to bring everything to a strategy point of view or communicate it from an effective perspective. And then I started framing I'm still in a learning phase. When I see that I'm not in that phase now, I try and make myself humble by interacting with people who are far smarter than me on different scale or reading different books, or watching podcasts like yourselves. And that keeps you grounded on the fact that okay, you are always learning. And I also found that seeing yourself as someone who's a learner is an enabling story to tell yourself, okay?

(00:35:58):
It may not be the most exciting story, it may not be the most memorable story about yourself, but it is definitely one of the enabling stories as well. Similarly, I think one other thing that I used to say about myself was more that I'm very high agency PM. But as I started working more in Southeast Asia, I learned that mindfulness is also very, very important, that not every team, not every culture will work with you in a very hyper aggressive style. But you still need to get the work done. And I'm still learning on that and therefore, I've started using a word, I don't want to be a high agency person, I want to be a mindful agency person. And so these terms are very important because these are the stories that you keep telling yourself and these also then start shaping your behavior. I do feel that I have a lot to do, I have a lot to learn on these skills, but these things definitely keep you grounded and you keep coming back to the learning phase again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:09):
It's interesting that when you saw Crystal being incredibly good at working with data, you just realized, "Hey, maybe I'm actually not very good at this." And your reaction wasn't, "God damn it, I'm really screwed and this is really depressing me", it's, "No, instead I'm going to try to get better at this." And that reminds me some of the feedback I get with this podcast, those people are like, "Man, these people are so good, I'm never going to be this good. It discourages me from thinking I will ever be super successful in this career." Clearly, you have a different approach. Do you have advice or guidance to folks that are sometimes discouraged seeing people being so incredible and helping them actually continue to level up in this rate of change you talked about versus just like, "Nope, I'm never going to be that good?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:37:54):
I think as product managers it becomes difficult because a lot of your growth is being determined because of feedback of others. And because product management is so ambiguous and still not defined, the stakeholders can also give feedback on variety of dimensions. Some of them may not even be important enough to give feedback on, but they are important enough for them and so therefore, they give you feedback. And therefore, you have to shape that feedback in. But you also have to consider that there are these eight access that we spoke about, the data access, the design and research access, the technology access, the strategy access, communication access, collaboration access, organizational skills access, and the community access. You need to channelize feedback into okay, is this an area that you are targeting for growth or not?

(00:38:51):
And one of the most important things that I learned was that when I joined Gojek or even earlier, there would be so many different areas that I needed to improve on and still need to improve on. You can't improve on every single area. That's what overwhelms you. You need to pick which is the area which is the maximum leverage for you and improve on that particular aspect and then move on to the next area, then move on to the next area and so on. Obviously, if you are floundering in something, if you're really negative in something, then you fix that first because that will give you the highest leverage. But if you are picking up data and design and strategy and technology all at the same time, that's when you'll overwhelm you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:33):
So to summarize the advice there is one, be actually very open to feedback you're getting. It's easy to say that, it's hard to actually listen to people criticizing you and act on it. So I think that's an important takeaway here is just actually, feedback is a gift and actually understand that and try to act on it. I have a great interview with Jules Walter who's a PM at Google now, and he has this awesome quote about how whenever people give him hard feedback, it's like internally he's just melting, but that's externally he's like, "Thank you so much for that feedback, I really appreciate it. It's very valuable."

(00:40:10):
And so that's a good way to get people to keep giving feedback. Okay. And then the other piece of advice you just shared there is pick a focus area. Like say you're getting all this feedback, your strategy isn't amazing, your PRDs aren't great, just find one thing to focus on. And I don't know, do you try to do somewhat quarter? Somewhat year? Do you have a heuristic of how long to spend on one thing?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:40:31):
So different skills take different time and how you are progressing also depends a lot as well. For skills which are softer in nature like communication and collaboration and community, those are skills that you will work on all your life. You'll never achieve anywhere near two or five on five on those ever. There'll always be something that you will miss, there will always be a new context, there'll always be a new set of stakeholders, new company cultures that you have to adapt to. For others, you have to see that what gives you the maximum leverage in your career. When you're starting off, my recommendation is that you pick between data and tech one, and definitely one on design and research and strategy.

(00:41:18):
So usually, that's the combo that I recommend. My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years. Once you've demonstrated on two of these three, between data, tech and design and research, then you start focusing on strategy. We've had great success at Gojek in transitioning a lot of product managers, especially in Indonesia, using this framework. And it's produced a lot of good product managers for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
Well, let's actually follow that thread. That's really interesting. And so the approach is you have this access of skillsets and you pick, for this person moving from say customer service to product, here's the two things you need to focus on. Can you talk more about that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:42:15):
Yeah. For instance, we recently had two PMs, one who came from a growth background. This is actually [inaudible 00:42:24]'s team. And one from a research background. And with both of them, we use very different tactics. So we gave one of finding driver redesign, which was very much a very design-focused product, but we still had them leverage their data skills because we were able to create a PRD with incredible amount of data on exactly what different segments of customers we're doing. And that then we worked with designers on what the designs and the framework for that will be. And even now, Lenny, if you will come and see our finding driver redesign next time you are in Asia, it's a piece of art. And if you would see that that was worked on by a product manager who actually came from a growth and data background, that makes it even more special.

(00:43:13):
Similarly, the PM who transitioned from research, I kept giving feedback on technology and data skills are the ones that we need to check. And I need to hear from engineers that yes, they're able to work with her very strongly. And once she was able to do that, she's recently turned a very heated question on one of the features that we were doing into a full-blown solution with designs, with trade-offs and everything, and able to now convert it into a question for leadership on how we should be approaching this particular product and direction. So I think that's proven successful as well. Similarly, there's another person who took risk who was originally from research and again, worked a lot on our products, including our enterprise product. And she's doing an amazing job as well. Again, going through that path of okay, these are the things that you need to leverage.

(00:44:14):
The only watch-out is that it doesn't work out always. In some cases, some PMs will pick these things up fast, and it also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills. But it's definitely doable if you get a very strong product leader working with you who's able to shape those skills for you. So it's sometimes okay to go a little slow when you're transitioning so that you're able to go faster later rather than getting faster somewhere and then being stuck there for a while.

(00:46:29):
Something that you mentioned earlier that I wanted to come back to is this confusion about what the PM role is and how that trips people up in being successful in the role and continuing to thrive in the role. You mentioned this to me offline too, that this is just something you deal with a lot, just this frustration of what the hell is this job? What am I actually responsible for? What am I not? What do you find is helpful in helping people work through that, get past that, not make that a big blocker in their career, not knowing exactly what the PM role is?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:46:56):
I think we've been in technology product for several decades now, but we are still figuring out what an exact definition of product management is. And even the strongest definitions are slightly principled and philosophical in nature, they're not very concrete, and that also means that every and different technology companies have gone through different journeys and they've defined the roles very, very differently. And even within a very large company, you will see that different teams, different divisions are approaching the roles very, very differently as well.

(00:47:34):
And on top of that, what that does is that not only internally the product managers are figuring this out, their managers, their leaders are figuring these things out for them, but the other stakeholders who have to work with these product managers are also confused and they don't know what to expect. And the number one question I get from stakeholders is, is a product manager expected to do this? Because they also don't know, okay, is this expected from a product manager or not? And my general answer to that is, if this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Love that.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:48:09):
But that works if the product managers have had some training and they have had some training in working with different stakeholders and they have had something on the job. What I've figured out is that there are certain functions and there are certain disciplines which you can't define, but you can only become better at with practice. For instance, what is an actor or what is a dancer? Right? So these are things that you will get better at as you become skilled at it. And earlier, these things used to be looked at as something which is very artistic, only the people who are talented or only specific kind of people can do it. But now, each one of those has become [inaudible 00:48:57] and frameworks as well. So there are courses on filmmaking, there are courses on acting, there are courses on dancing and so on. And similarly, product management is that space as well.

(00:49:08):
So you have to understand there's an art to it and there's a science to it, but you can use the science to figure out the art. So that's the philosophical side of it. The second side of it is what we spoke about earlier that instead of figuring out what is product management, figure out what's your contribution, what's your output and figure out are you contributing on these access on data, on design, on technology and on strategy. And one of my favorite things is that if you created these four circles of strategy, of technology, of design and of data, and you created a product management circle which encircles each one of these, so you are the only discipline, which is the co-collaborator for all of these disciplines and tying all these things out.

(00:49:59):
So it's not about you standing alone, it's you always collaborating and pairing with someone else. But you are the only one who's pairing with everyone else and therefore, you have that unique insight which no one else in the team will have. That role can be played by someone else, it doesn't necessarily need to be called a product manager. But if you are being called a product manager, you figure out the [inaudible 00:50:24] the time piece that you are. And when you are added to the team, you must dream the team's overall contribution, overall energy and overall output up and not down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that. Something I always tell people is the PM doesn't necessarily have the magical skills other team members don't have, it's that they don't also have another job. Engineers may do a great job at being the PM, they just also have to build and code. And they don't have time to do all the things that a PM has to do, and a designer is in the same way, a researcher or data person. And so oftentimes, that's just like there's this person that has the time to do all these glue, work things between teams. And the great PMs also are very good at these skills that help you do these things, but it doesn't mean other people can't do them.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:51:19):
You see yourself as playing a role and not your title and not your function, and that just clarifies a lot of things for people. And different people will play different roles. And depending on the kind of a PM you are, are you in a specific domain or you are slightly generalist, the role that you will be playing in different teams can be different and the variety of roles that you can play makes you a better product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
I love that. You've mentioned these four access attributes of great product managers, overall product managers. Let's just spend a little time here. So you say basically the things you need to be doing and good at, data, design/research technology, strategy, and then you also mentioned collaboration and communication. Maybe you're-

Vikrama Dhiman (00:52:08):
Yeah, organizational skills and community. I think those are very, very important because one of the things and one of the things which one of the product managers works with me continues to say, and I really plus on that a lot, is that product manager is the all community enabler in the team, in the organization. And that community is the software aspect which ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output. And that I think is a very, very important goal in today's context, especially for teams which are becoming more remote or teams where people are not co-located or they're distributed. That community aspect becomes a very, very important part that product managers need to focus on and bring and channelize as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):
So let's just quickly describe each of these attributes. I imagine people might be thinking, "Okay, what should I get better at as a PM?" And this is an awesome list. Each company has their own career ladders and attributes and things like that, but not a lot of companies don't. So I think for people that are trying to figure out where do I need to get better, I think this is a really cool list. Can you just maybe just a sentence explanation of each of these attributes and skillsets that a PM needs?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:31):
So each one of those skills, like the most growth ladders, what they will do, is they will have say for data, they will have level one, exhibits these traits. Level two, exhibits this trait. Level three, exhibits this trait. Level four and level five and so on. That's how they'll describe it. But five is absolute ninja level data quality, like you could probably do a data startup of your own.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:55):
Like Crystal basically?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:57):
Crystal. And level zero is someone who cannot even basically define the basic metrics for this particular product and won't be able to figure out is this particular thing impacting orders or users or revenue. And so you'll really not be able to figure even that piece out. Similarly, on design and research, for product managers, we focus a lot more on problems and are you able to identify problems from a user's perspective. That's at level zero. And level five will be somebody who's able to define the user problems but is also able to tie them to business roles as well. So that makes it the holistic. Similarly, on technology, it's one of the skills which is relatively easier to define where you don't have any tech understanding. If somebody asked you what is HTTP or API or internet and you'll be like, "Okay, I don't know what it is."

(00:54:55):
And while on the other end, you are able to have deep debates and could probably write technology design documents yourself as well. I think sometimes people get confused between data science. And in different organizations, I see data science bucketed either in data or in technology. Either is fine as long as you are clear on what your organization's framework is. Similarly then, there is strategy. Strategy is I think another area in product management which gets very confusing because there is obviously corporate strategy, there is business strategy, there's pricing strategy, there's strategy everywhere. Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece.

(00:55:47):
So you are not in charge of okay, are you focused on growth? Are you focused on revenue? Are you focused on profitability? That's someone's choice. Are you going to pick this country? Are you going to pick that country? But once that is picked, what are the user segments that you're going to focus on? What are the needs of those user segments? How are we going to figure out what the right product for them will be? What is the order in which we are going to work on that? That whole piece of product strategy is with the product managers. And again, in the first case, you are basically going to rely on everyone to tell you, do this, do this, do this. In second and in the level five cases, you are able to articulate a very coherent product strategy at a broad level as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
Amazing, thanks for sharing that. I think for people that are trying to craft career ladder for product managers, this could help inform the way they think about this. By the way, when we mentioned Crystal, for folks that have no idea who we're talking about, she was a early head of growth at Gojek back in the day. She was a previous guest on the podcast. I always forget how to pronounce her last name exactly, but I think it's Widjaja, Crystal Widjaja.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:56:33):
Widjaja.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
Widjaja? Okay, okay. Great. Going in a different direction, we're going to move to contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you believe that other people wouldn't agree with or generally just don't believe?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:57:12):
I used to think intent is the most important thing, right? And when I was starting off, that used to be the advice that as long as your intent is right, even if some of your words are not landing, even if some of the comms are not landing, that will work out. What I've seen is that it's not enough. Your actions, your behavior, and the way you communicate, the way you collaborate, that also has to communicate and show who you are as well. So intent is not enough. And that's a thing which I think a lot of people in my age group just don't get, but people who are slightly starting off their career, it resonates well with them. Second thing I think where I feel that it's become, I don't know, is it contrarian or it's become politically incorrect, is that you still need to put in the effort and our number of hours is effort.

(00:58:23):
And I think that's one thing which has become very politically incorrect to say over the years when I was younger, it was the norm that yes, you will have to put in the effort, you will have to put in the hours to grow and improve your skills. And it's not even about your growth in the company, it's just your own growth. You have to spend the time, effort, and energy into growing. I think a lot of that is getting lost in the debates between complete workaholism and just being not very serious about your growth at all. So I think those are the two that I find myself having to explain myself again and again and why I feel this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
I completely agree with that. I find a hugely strong correlation between hours you put into the work you do and success. And I think there's been a return to okay, working hard is really important and you shouldn't be afraid of promoting working really hard. So we've actually gone through everything that I wanted to ask you. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:59:41):
No, I think it has been great talking to. I hope it was useful to people. I've tried to keep it real, but also in takeaway format. And if there are any questions that you have that I feel I have not answered, I'm happy to answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:01):
Okay, amazing. Well, we'll have people post in the comments if there's anything else they would love to ask you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:19):
The first book is a book which I feel is not quoted enough in product management community, is a book called Small Data by Martin Lindstrom. This is a person who was an advertiser or marketeer who would go and make campaigns for big brands in different countries, and so would have usually very short time to get the pulse of that space and design a campaign around it. And how he got insights very quickly from, and what are some of the takeaways that are there for people working in product space, not just product managers, but designers, researchers, strategy people, anyone really, I can't recommend that book more. And I've cited that book a lot internally.

(01:01:09):
The second book that I recommend is Adam Grant's Originals. I think it's a very important book. It changed a lot of things. When I spoke about that I was going through this crisis of, oh, I'm behind so many things after joining Gojek, Originals was one book that I read which really, really helped me think about my growth and how I see myself. And anyone who is stuck or anyone who feels they are superstars, they are the innovators of the century kind of a thing, it's a book that gives you a very good reality check. And the third book that I recommend is definitely Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. I think especially the thinking slow part becomes very, very important piece as well.

(01:02:11):
And the reason why change is hard, the reason why feedback is hard is because we are used to thinking fast and we are not used to thinking slow. While if you actually think slow, you'll actually welcome change and growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):
Amazing. That book's come up a bunch actually recently on the podcast and it is always sitting under my laptop, holding up my laptop for these interviews. So I fully agree. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:02:41):
I haven't seen a lot of movies recently, I think. But while I was on the flight back from Dubai, I saw Miss Congeniality again and I really, really enjoyed it. I thought it's a very fun movie, but also had a pretty good message. I know it's probably not the movie which anyone would want to cited, but I think it's sometimes good to just watch good entertainment.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):
That's quite the contrarian pick. Yeah, nobody has cited this movie, Miss Congeniality. This is a first, but I love it. It's way out there. I would never would've expected this.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:03:27):
In terms of TV shows, I think the show that I really go back to all the time is Schitt's Creek. I think it's a show which operates at so many different levels without taking itself that seriously, and it just lands. And especially as a product manager and as a leader who obsesses a lot about diversity, I think it did a fantastic job in showing different sides of motherhood, of the LGBTQIA communities, and also teenage girls figuring themselves out as well. I think it did a fantastic job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're hiring product managers especially?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:04:13):
So it's not really one question, but what I like to do with them is to brainstorm choices on an actual product. And I'll typically pick up a product that they use most often and then I will be like, "Okay, what if this product were to do this? Then what do you think, it makes sense? Don't think it makes sense? What about this? Okay, how would it evolve in six months? What would happen in 12 months and so on?" I think it gives you a far better insight into how would it be on working with them on a real case. And you also keep... And what I like about it is that you can keep going back deeper into it and develop it together. So I typically try and pick product that I will also not have very strong opinions on so that it can become a two-way conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):
What do you actually look for in an answer that tells you, "Okay, this candidate is amazing" versus flags that are like, "Hmm, maybe not?"

Vikrama Dhiman (01:05:21):
There are some obvious check marks that are they able to first abstract out and figure out what the overall goals for the product are, who the users for that product are, what would they be focusing on right now, whether this will align with that or not. And then a reason backwards that okay, maybe this may not work, but something on these lines. Are you obsessed about this feature or are you obsessed about okay, what this enables you to do? So if this is what it enables you to do, then are you okay with considering some other options and so on? So I think that's the direction which usually goes in the right way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:04):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:06:08):
So the reason why I've not watched a lot of drama or TV recently is because I've discovered these short video apps through Instagram and all of these apps, they dub Chinese TV serials into English or there will be subtitles in English and they are delivered in TikTok style two-minute videos. And it's a masterstroke in how the series are constructed. The first few episodes, which is like 10 episodes which is about 10 to 15 minutes, sets up the story in such a way that you have to unlock the next 10.

(01:06:47):
And these videos are quite expensive. They end up, one series takes more than the entire cost of monthly cost of Netflix to view. But it's just amazing how the whole product has been put, how all these products have been put together on unlocking the lamification aspects of it, the storytelling aspects of it, the content cutting part of it, and even the selection of the stories part of it. And what I'm told is that once I've learned about it, I've also been reading about it, they're actually companies which are able to give you tools of where you can construct this app yourself. And multiple people, two-people, three-people companies are churning these out and earning a lot of profit from it as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
What is this called for people that want to check this out?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:07:43):
So you can start with DramaBox, you can start with [inaudible 01:07:47] Reels and so on. And there are multiple of these. And those of you who are very familiar with TikTok, you would've seen that some of these show you the first 10 episodes on TikTok and then they take you to their app to view the rest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
Wow. I love so many unusual contrarian pieces of advice here, I love it. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:08:15):
For me, the most important thing has been that I started my career very late in tech. I was already 25. For the first several years, I worked in a small [inaudible 01:08:32] town in India. I came to Delhi only in 2013, and I joined Gojek in 2018. I think I've done reasonably well for myself. And it's never late to do or what do you want to do and what do you want to be. I think that's the thing that I really, really believe in and I also advise in. Especially as the world is aging and a lot of people are thinking about it, I would say that it's not too late ever. You can be and do what you want right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
So good. It's not too late. I really, really like that advice. My wife is an illustrator designer. She has a book she put out called Am I Overthinking This? It's in my background somewhere there. And she has a chart that communicates that exact message in a really cute way, and we'll try to link to it in the show notes. Final question. You live in Singapore, I know you travel a lot. But if someone were to come to Singapore, is there a food that you think they need to try that's unique to Singapore?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:09:45):
Singapore? There are multiple. So Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures. There are four official languages. And the only thing I will advise is depending on your taste buds, whatever you want to do, you should go and visit a Hawker Center. And it's an amazing experience in itself. And those of you who've seen Crazy Rich Asians, the first thing they do when they land in Singapore is go to the Hawker Center. So it's an experience of its kind. And if you are looking for a specific recommendation, go to Lau Pa Sat. If you are a fan of Indian, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Malay cuisine, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Singaporean Chinese, you'll get that. So you pick what works for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that. Vikrama, I feel like we've produced both a lot of output and we're going to have really great outcomes from our conversation. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow-up on any of the stuff we talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:10:53):
Thank you, Lenny. It's been great talking to you as well. Hopefully, this turns out well. You can reach out to me either on LinkedIn, Vikrama Dhiman, or you can reach out on Twitter. Twitter works better. And the listeners can be useful to me by, well, just sharing whatever they feel. And I continuously follow a lot of people, a lot of people who are not yet famous. Just tell me what your story is, just tell me what you are working on. And as long as you are passionate about it, I will try and find time. Maybe I cannot talk to everyone, but I'll definitely try and find to chat with you and listen out and support or connect you to someone who can help support you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
That's a very generous offer, I think a lot of people are going to take you up on that. Vikrama, thank you so much for being here.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:11:51):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

## Transcript

Wes Kao (00:00:00):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy. I'm a big proponent of asking myself, if I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing? How could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach in writing. Any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:00:35):
I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you are just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people, and it's confusing, you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You have an awesome framework called MOO.

Wes Kao (00:00:54):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. A lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get especially in meetings, we feel blindsided. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. Are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):
Today my guest is Wes Kao. Wes co-created the Alt-MBA program with Seth Godin. She Co-Founded a company called Maven, which I often collaborate with, which makes it easy for people to host live cohort-based courses. She recently left Maven to launch her own course on Executive Communication and Influence. There's a quote that came to mind after I stopped recording this conversation with Wes by George Bernard Shaw, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

(00:01:51):
By the end of this podcast if you listen to what Wes suggests, you'll be a lot closer to becoming a world-class communicator.

Wes Kao (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm very honored to be a second-time guest.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
Very rare honor. No pressure, but I think this is going to be one of the highest leverage episodes I've done and let me tell you why I think that's the case in the newsletter and on the podcast, I often talk about just how important and how high leverage the skill of communication is to product leaders, to leaders, just to people in general. There's this quote that Boz, the CTO of Meta, he's been on the podcast, he wrote this famous blog post, "Communication is the job." And I think that's true for product people, but it's true for basically any sort of leadership role. Anyone trying to get ahead. And you are one of the best communicators I've ever met. You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. You have one of the most popular courses on Maven, on executive communication, so I'm really excited to have you here and to help people become better communicators, better at influence and all these things. So thank you again for being here.

Wes Kao (00:05:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
Okay. So something that I often do with guests on the podcast, not even often, always, I ping people that the guests have worked with and ask them, "What should I ask Wes? What should I know about Wes?" Let me read a few quotes about you in regards to your communication skills from folks that have worked with you-

Wes Kao (00:05:34):
All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
And these are three different people. Okay, so first, "Wes single handedly raised the quality of the entire company's writing by like two X across the board. I always say the best writing course I ever took was working with Wes for a year."

Wes Kao (00:06:07):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:09):
Okay. That's one.

Wes Kao (00:06:10):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:10):
"Wes never just throws things out there, she's precise with her use of language, meticulous about examining her own ideas before bringing them in front of others and knows how to make her points in a way that people will understand them and buy into them." Okay. And third, "Wes includes a reasoning with every proposal in the context behind all of her recommendations so that everyone around her learns in order of magnitude faster. This also makes her an exceptional teacher because she can clearly define what excellence is and why something is the goal, and then break down the steps and principles involved." Okay, reactions.

Wes Kao (00:06:46):
Those are really nice things. That's amazing. Yeah, thank you so much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
And these are people across different companies, so.

Wes Kao (00:06:52):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Okay, so that was just to highlight of how good you are at this stuff. And what we're going to be doing with our chat is going through a bunch of your tactics that you teach and that have helped people become better communicators, executive communicators, better at influence. Before we get into the specific tactics, is there anything that you think is important for people to understand just broadly around the skill of becoming a better communicator?

Wes Kao (00:07:17):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy, there's a lot of avoidable questions, and I'm a big proponent of asking myself, "If I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing to that?" So, you know, instead of blaming other people for not understanding me, I think about how could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have? So I'm a big proponent of agency. And realizing that we can only control our own behavior. And so the best place to start, if you're not getting the reaction you're looking for, is reflecting on how can I get better at the skill of communicating? And it absolutely is a skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
So what I'm hearing is if you're having a hard time people buying into what you're trying to convince them to do or you're finding people are doing not what you asked them to do, it's likely an issue with your ability to communicate, it's probably not their fault.

Wes Kao (00:08:28):
Yeah, I would say so. You can't solve everything with improving your communication, but you can increase the likelihood of getting what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
Cool. Okay. Anything else along these lines of just things that are important to understand just broadly around communication, executive communication?

Wes Kao (00:08:46):
I think another big one that I teach in my course and really kick off with is practicing like it's game day, playing like it's game day. So I see a lot of operators who save their best behavior for executives only. So you know, they want to shine when they're presenting to senior leadership, but with everyone else, they're kind of calling it. And I just don't think that you're going to be able to get enough reps to actually get good at executive communication if you are only doing it with executives. Because many of us only present to execs once a month, right? Or a couple of times a quarter. And that's just not a lot of chance to practice. So really treating every single stakeholder as if they are important because they are, and you shouldn't be if you don't want to waste your CEO's time, you also shouldn't waste your cross-functional team members' time or your manager's time or your direct reports' time. So that's something else that I ask to keep in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
And maybe a last question before we get into the tactics. When people think communication, they think email, they think meeting presentations, things like that. How do you think about, when you talk about executive communication and communication in general, what's kind of the umbrella of things that includes?

Wes Kao (00:09:53):
Yeah, I would say broadly the two mediums are verbal communication and written. So verbal being meetings, conversations, presentations. And written being emails, strategy docs, notion docs, Slack messages, text messages, those two categories broadly. And I also think about communication as more of a means to an end, which might be interesting for some people because I teach a course on communication. So you would think that's like the end in and of itself, but I really see it as a means to an end where the end is getting the ideal outcome you're looking for. So whether that is buy-in or making a good decision as a team or moving to the next step, whatever that might be, communication is really in service of that end goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:43):
Awesome. Okay. So I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach, and talking to folks that you've taught and folks that you've worked with. So I'm just going to go through a bunch and let's just help people get better at these things.

Wes Kao (00:10:58):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
Okay. So the first is something you call sales, then logistics. What is that about?

Wes Kao (00:11:07):
Yes. So a common mistake that I see is overestimating the amount of buy-in that you have from your audience. So that looks like jumping straight into talking about the logistics, the details of the how to do something, of the process. When in reality your audience has not yet decided if they even want to do the thing. So what I see operators do in response then is go even deeper into the logistics and the how, thinking that, "Oh, if I just explain this more than that person will want to do it." When really a sales note is different than a logistics note. A sales note is meant to get people excited to do the thing you want them to do, and to agree to do it. And only then after they have bought in, does it make sense to share the logistics.

(00:11:57):
So there's an order of operations here. If you switch the order of operations, you will likely get a slow response or just no response, right? We've all put a Slack message in a channel and got crickets and tumbleweed. So really starting off with selling the person and making sure that they know why we're doing this, why this matters to the company, why now, and then sharing the logistics tends to be a lot more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Is there an example of that that might help illustrate that point or that approach?

Wes Kao (00:12:27):
Yeah. So one of my clients is a head of operations and she was trying to get the rest of her executive team, which she was a part of, to fill in some wins for the week so that they could share this out with the whole company. And this was going to be motivating, it was going to shine a light on folks. And she led with the logistics of which document to send, to put the details in, what time to put it in by, the format that you should put these wins and didn't really get much of a response from the leadership team, which makes sense, right? Because this totally sounds like one of those things that's another item to check off on your list when you already have so many other things to do and here's this other process that like we're all supposed to do now, like yay, right? And so she wasn't really getting response. And that's because she dove straight into logistics.

(00:13:20):
Whereas what she could have done is start by selling folks, selling the other executives on why are we doing this? Well, we're doing this because this is a chance to shine a light on your team members who are doing amazing work, for them to feel motivated and to feel like the rest of the company really sees them and understands what they're doing. And this is all something that is going to motivate your team, right? So sharing why this is helpful and useful and how this is in service of you and your team versus like, "Oh, this is a favor that you're doing for me to fill out this form and fill it out this way and by this date," et cetera, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
I know that execs often want the opposite where they're just like, "Okay, I know, just tell me what you want to do. Just like, okay, just get to the point. I don't want time for all this context and background." Any advice on when to spend any time on the sales? Like what are signs that, okay, maybe you don't have them sold yet, or what are maybe contexts where you should probably still try to sell them first?

Wes Kao (00:14:20):
Yeah. So I actually think that you should always do a little bit of selling even for situations where people have generally bought in. Because most of us have a lot going on and we're not actively thinking about whatever you're talking about. So even though I agreed to something two weeks ago, by the time you're telling me about it again, like I thought about a billion other things since then, right? So reminding me of why are we talking about this? Why does this matter? And then getting into it and framing that conversation upfront is way more likely for us to not get stuck in a cold start and not kind of go two steps back one step forward.

(00:14:55):
The other thing is, you can frame a conversation and sell a bit at the beginning very concisely. So I'm not talking about spending 15 minutes out of a 30 minute meeting selling, I'm talking about one to two minutes, even a couple sentences, and then transitioning into the main thing you want to talk about. So I'm a huge proponent of doing that and basically reminding people, why are we doing this? Why are we here today? Why does this matter? And then getting into the meat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:24):
I love that. So basically you can do this really briefly, it doesn't have to be a whole pitch for half an hour. It's just a reminder, "Here's why we think this is important." And I think that's such a good point because a lot of times it's like a leader is looking at this thing you're asking them to do and they're like, "Why are we even, why am I spending time on this?" And just a reminder of like, "Okay, I see, I forgot this was going to be, this a part of our strategy, this has this much impact potential or here's how it could help our team be more efficient."

Wes Kao (00:15:52):
Yeah. And you can really do that in like 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
Is there like a, I don't know, structure to this? Is it just like why? Is there a kind of a template you like or some way you recommend of selling first? Is it like, "Here's why we're doing this." Starting like that? Anything along those lines?

Wes Kao (00:16:09):
Yeah. I think explaining why we're doing this, why this benefits the business, what problem this is solving. Again, you can do a lot of this in a couple of sentences. And then I also like asking or stating what I need from the other person upfront. So saying, "Hey, we're here today because two weeks ago we were reviewing the product flow and realized that there were a couple of parts that were kind of confusing. So I took a stab at fixing those areas, rewriting the microcopy, and I want to present them to you today, see if you agree with these changes, and then we're going to roll them out. What I'm looking for from you is feedback on the changes and if you agree." So like that was like 15 seconds, right? Super fast. And then now we're all on the same page about why we're here. And you can listen more intently knowing that I'm looking for a certain kind of feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
I would love to hear it that way. I think there's like an implication here that maybe is worth sharing of just, a lot of this is about communicating effectively to execs, which will make you communicate better to most people. But especially with folks up the ladder. They don't have a lot of time, they have a million things in their head. Maybe just share like why this is so important, like what the state of mind of a leader is that you need to kind of break through.

Wes Kao (00:17:25):
Yeah. So I call it the yes, yes, yes, next, next, next mindset where if I'm listening to direct reports present something to me, very often I find myself thinking, "Got it. All right, yes, let's keep going." Right? And you know, on the other side of that, I've often presented to executives where I had a 15 slide deck and execs would do that and I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like I have a whole sequence, I have a whole order, you know? And sometimes they would give me buy or make the decision by slide four, you know? And I'd be like, "Okay, well you know, slide 13, I want to show you this great graph I put together." Right? And what was really helpful for me was realizing that I should take the win. Okay, if five seconds already agreed, take the win and keep it moving, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):
Yeah. What's that quote like? "If you've sold them, stop talking."

Wes Kao (00:18:16):
Right. Yes. Yeah, you might talk them out of agreeing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
Yeah. Okay. You mentioned being concise. Let's talk about that. You have some really good advice on just how to effectively be concise and not too concise. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:18:31):
Yes. One of my pet peeves is when people are too concise and they equate being concise with brief, being brief. And being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about economy of words. It's about the density of the insight that you're sharing. And so you can have a 300 word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise. And so not equating concision with briefness I think is a really big one to understand.

(00:19:05):
The second thing is a lot of advice about being concise, I think misses an important point. So we've all heard, "Don't bury the lead, cut to the chase." Main point, put the main point at the top, bottom line up front, right? And all of these pithy aphorisms assume that you actually know what your core point is. So you can't cut to the chase unless you know what the chase is. You can't unbury the lead unless you know what the lead is. And so that I found is the bottleneck to being concise. It's actually not really being clear of what you are thinking, that's what's leading to being long-winded.

(00:19:49):
And you can kind of test this theory because most of us have a go-to story that we've told a bunch of times, right? We're like, you know exactly when people are going to laugh, you know when they're going to gasp or hold their breath, right? And why are you so good at telling that story and why are you so concise about it? Because you've told it a bunch of times, you know all of the beats. So in meetings though, at work, we are very rarely talking about the same thing that many times it's always something new. It's something that we are also probably likely processing ourselves and are in the midst of processing as we are in a quick turnaround time, telling someone else about it, telling our team about it. And so you are basically asking your brain to do a lot of different processes, especially in a real time conversation. You're listening to the other person absorbing, making sense of it, processing it, figuring out what you think and how you would react.

(00:20:39):
And then trying to say something cohesive that makes sense, right? And then trying to be concise about it. So it's just a lot of different processes. And so the only solution I found consistently to being concise is preparation. It's not a very glamorous solution by any means, but the clearer I am going into a meeting, going into a conversation, going into a pitch, the better I am at being concise and being able to bring the conversation back to the most important points at being able to stay flexible, but also firm and preparation. I don't mean spending hours and hours preparing for a weekly meeting, even a couple of minutes really makes a huge difference.

(00:21:25):
Most of us are so back to back in meetings that we're doing zero preparation. It's like the meeting has started 30 seconds in and you're still unwinding from the last Zoom call that you were on, right? So most of us are in that mental state. So if you even take 30 seconds to one minute to ground yourself on why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across in the time that we have, you're going to go in there so much more focused and so much more able to be concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
So the advice there, so this is for meetings and I want to talk about writing also, but for meetings, the advice here is before you get into a meeting, actually think about why am I in this meeting? What do I want to get out of it? Instead of in the meeting figuring out a lot as you go, which to your point, you're just going to ramble and be like, "Oh, okay, here's what I actually want to say."

Wes Kao (00:22:10):
Yeah. And what might I want to share in the meeting too? You know, especially for more introverted folks. Sometimes you need to decide beforehand that you want to speak and you want to make sure you get a certain point across. So even deciding that beforehand makes a huge difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:25):
Yeah, I found this extremely powerful just like five minutes before you get into a meeting. And it could happen earlier in the day, right? It doesn't have to happen right before the meeting, or worst case, it's right before the meeting. Just, "Okay, what do I want to get out of this? What am I here? What do I want to say?" And just like giving your brain a little bit of time to prepare. Super powerful. In writing, is there like any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:22:50):
I think the main tactic is to remind yourself to be concise. And usually when I do that, I end up trimming 20% at least of what I wrote, tightening up some sentences. I also ask myself, how might I be adding cognitive load to whatever it is that I'm saying? So is there a tighter, clearer, cleaner way that I can ask what I'm asking or present the information I'm presenting or make the recommendation that I'm making? And usually if you even ask yourself that, your brain automatically comes up with stuff. You just see whatever you wrote differently and you're like, "Oh shit, I could trim this entire paragraph because that's secondary." And maybe you have your primary message in Slack, and then within the thread add some of the secondary stuff, right? So I find that most of us, it's reminding yourself to be concise. And once you think of it, your brain naturally will see places where you can trim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
There's a layer of advice under this that you're not saying that I'm going to say, which is actually look at the thing you wrote at least once before you share it. Because I used to be really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. I wrote this doc, send it, get feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. We wrote this doc, send it, get feedback. All right. Send this email. I don't have time to read this email." And I find just forcing yourself to look at it solves so much of this.

Wes Kao (00:24:10):
Oh, yes, yes, definitely. I was assuming before doing that, but you're right, some people might not be. And yes, definitely reading your own message first is huge. And yeah, I find that even doing that you can often spot a lot of low-hanging fruit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Right. You'll find the typos and grammar issues and you'll be like, "Oh, I don't need this word." Along those lines, let me share two books. People always ask me, "How did you learn to write?" I'm like, "I'm not a writer, I don't know what I'm doing." But two books really helped me write more effectively. And one is specifically to help you write more concisely called On Writing Well. I don't know if you've read that.

Wes Kao (00:24:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Okay. And it's basically chapter after chapter of, "Here's what you can cut. And you can cut more. And look what more you can cut and cut this stuff." And he has screenshots of essays that students have written in his class and he's like, "Look at all those words you cut and nothing has changed. It's exactly the same message and even is better with 40% of the words cut."

Wes Kao (00:25:12):
Is this by Sol Stein or another author?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):
I don't have it... It's somewhere in my bookshelf. So we'll look it up.

Wes Kao (00:25:19):
Yeah, there's a writing book by Sol Stein that I absolutely love. And I feel like it might be called On Writing Well, but then also I could see there being multiple books called On Writing Well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
There's also Writing Well I think by Stephen King, that's another one that people love, but there On Writing Well is the one I really loved because it's very tactical.

Wes Kao (00:25:37):
Going back to something that you were saying earlier with rereading what you wrote, I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. So if you're just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people and it's confusing and you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. All 15 of these people are reading this being like, "Okay, what do I do with this?"

(00:26:05):
Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races. They would've read your message and then known exactly what to do next or what their part was or what you were looking for from them. So I think about that a lot too. It's not just me writing this and sending it off. It's, "Who are all the people who are going to come in contact with this message who are going to refer to it and use it? And if I just take 30 more seconds to make sure that it's clean, how much can I unblock from their work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:34):
That's such a good point. I like that, I love that term blast radius. It's such a good point. Just like there's so much negative leverage in writing inefficiently and inconcisely. If you spend like... Inconcisely? I don't know the word is there, but if you just spend three minutes spending a little more time making it more clear just like the impact and leverage that has, that's such a good point. I looked up the books, it's so funny. Okay, so there's On Writing Well by William Zinsser. There's Stein On Writing by Sol Stein, which is what you said you were talking about. And then Stephen King has a book called On Writing. Everyone's got the same.

Wes Kao (00:27:09):
Yeah. Common title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:12):
Not ideal for SEO but On Writing Well is the one that I love by William Zinsser. There's also one called A Series Of Short Sentences if you haven't seen that one. It's a really good rate too. It's just how to write short sentences and just the power of just keeping sentences short, which I struggle with.

Wes Kao (00:27:27):
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:28):
Okay. Back to our agenda. There's another framework/tactic that I've heard you recommend. It's called signposting. What is signposting?

Wes Kao (00:27:38):
Signposting is using certain words, phrases, formatting, and an overall structure in your writing that helps guide your reader and signals what is coming in the rest of the post. So, this is especially helpful if you have a long memo. It adds structure to where are we going and what certain sections of paragraphs are about. So some of my favorite signposting words are, "for example," shows that you're about to show an example because shows that you're about to share your logic and rationale behind something. "As a next step," is a great one. People's eyes automatically zoom to, "as a next step." Even "First, second, third," kicking off a paragraph with that, you're not needing to rely on rich text formatting with bolding, italics, underlines and all that craziness. If you kick off sentences with signposting words, you can often signal, "Here's what I'm about to talk about in this paragraph."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
These are power words for clarity. There's this whole concept of power words like, "free."

Wes Kao (00:28:47):
Yeah. "A gift."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
"Gift." Yeah. For copywriting and these are basically power words for helping your brain see the structure and get to the thing you want to pay attention to. So I'll read back the words you just used. "For example," " because," "as a next step," and then, "first, second, third."

Wes Kao (00:29:05):
Yeah. Yeah. You can use signposting in writing and verbally too. So if you're doing a product demo, you might say something like, "The most important part to pay attention to is, blank." Or, "The part that we were most surprised by is, blank." Or, "The part that customers are," et cetera. Right? So it's, you're signaling that whatever comes after this thing is something that you may want to pay attention to. So it's a great way not only to add structure, but to also grab people's attention back if it has strayed some time as they were either listening to you or reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:42):
Along those lines, I find I find formatting really helpful here, just bold and bullets. I know you have a pet peeve with too much formatting. How much is too much formatting?

Wes Kao (00:29:51):
I really hate excessive formatting. So, I've seen memos where 30% of the note was bolded. And that just negates the entire point of bolding because if everything is bolded then nothing is being highlighted, right? So I think using formatting in general more sparingly than you think you have to is probably a good rule of thumb. I also dislike when people overuse bullets and sentence fragments, phrases in bullets when they should use complete sentences that actually show the connected tissue between ideas, that show the logical flow of what it is that you're saying.

(00:30:33):
And it feels faster and more concise to put bullets and fragments, but a lot of times your reader on the other end of that is needing to decipher and interpret and guess what you actually meant. So it net, net takes longer. And I also think that it can be a little bit of a crutch, it can be a little bit lazy because you are telling yourself that you're being concise when really, if you had to turn your sentence fragment into a full sentence, a lot of times it actually is harder than you think because you realize that you actually didn't really know exactly what you meant. So as you're trying to turn it into a full sentence, you're actually needing to use brainpower.

(00:31:15):
So that's I think a great litmus test of, "Was that idea fully thought out?" Because if it was, you should be able to really quickly turn it into a complete sentence. And many times, you actually aren't. So I see people like basically think, "Oh, I want to make this easier to read, more skimmable. I'm just going to throw a bunch of formatting and bullets and turn everything into bullets." And it's not quite that easy of a solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:41):
This is very much along the lines of the whole Amazon six-page memo where Jeff Bezos just realized, "If you can't write it out as a long memo and explain yourself in prose, you don't actually know what you're saying." And it's a really good filter for helping people actually crystallize and know themselves, "Okay, I see. I don't actually know what I'm doing here." And I love this is a microcosm of that. Can you just make a bullet point a real sentence versus a fragment of a sentence?

(00:32:06):
I'm thinking about as a listener being like, "Okay, how do I actually get better at this?" So maybe let's take a tangent. I know that you teach a whole course, you do all this stuff hands-on with people to help them actually build these skills. For someone that hasn't taken the course or isn't taking it, what's a good way to start practicing these skills and know if what you're writing is getting better, is good. Is it find a mentor, find someone that you think is a great writer and have them review stuff? Any tips there?

Wes Kao (00:32:34):
Yeah. So I have a pretty first principles driven approach for this, which is to think about how long does it take me right now to get to the reaction I'm looking for from my recipient? If it takes a bunch of back and forth and a bunch of friction, then that's my baseline. And once you start practicing some of these communication skills, how does that speed up? If you would have had seven different touch points of back and forth, does that shrink to two to three?

(00:33:08):
Not every point of friction is going to be avoidable, but a lot of it is if you get better at communicating. So I like watching for the reaction and how quickly and how enthusiastically I'm able to get that reaction. And for the things that are working, do more of that. For things that are not working, adjust your execution because it might not be that the tactic doesn't work, it might be your execution of it wasn't great. And keep trying, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:35):
So the advice here is just see how well you're writing/meeting/suggestion goes, how well it does. And if it's not like there's the ideal immediately, "Yes, let's do it." And then there's the, "I don't really understand." There's the spectrum of response. And what I'm hearing is just pay attention to if the speed to getting what you want is increasing in general.

Wes Kao (00:33:59):
Yeah, yeah. I don't think that there's any single shortcut on how to get better besides that. I do think that being fascinated by a topic and being excited about it makes it more likely that you're going to find it fun to try all these different things and try different ways to get through to people. So, I would approach it with a hypothesis-driven experimental mindset and almost like a game. Like, "When I do this, how does that other person react? If I frame it this way, do I get a different reaction? When I try this, am I able to cut through the noise more?"

(00:34:39):
Yeah. So I really think it's about practicing. And I will say that the way not to do it is to try to incorporate 30 different tactics at the same time and then beat yourself up when you don't remember to do them. It's really easy when you are learning a new field or function to get overwhelmed when you're learning a new skill. And the way to build a habit is usually not changing so many different things at once. It's picking one thing that you want to try and keeping that top of mind, trying it in a bunch of different settings in different ways. And getting it better at that thing before moving on to the next thing.

(00:35:19):
So that's like a really common thing I see in my course is people feeling overwhelmed. And I always remind folks that, "You are building a new habit here. And be patient with yourself, take it step by step."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:31):
There's a lot of stuff we're talking about here that a lot of people might be like, "This is so minor. What? I just bullet point sentences, be a little... Tell them the why at the beginning."

(00:35:41):
And I just want to share in my experience the biggest jump I made in my career was actually getting better at these very specific skills. I had this manager, Vlad, who's been on the podcast and I talk about him regularly, who was such a stickler about communicating well and being very clear and concise and thinking and just spending more time on documents and emails, on strategy docs. Just like, "No, this isn't ready. Spend more time, here's something that's not clear." And just doing that was such an accelerant for me.

(00:36:12):
And it's all these little things. That's what's interesting about it. It's like everything seems really minor but it all adds up to a lot of impact because to your point, people see it, "Okay, cool, I get it, let's go." Versus like, "I don't like this idea." And then it's like it all falls apart. So I guess any reactions to that?

Wes Kao (00:36:29):
Yeah. All these little things compound and make a big difference. I often hear people think, "Well, this individual instance, this individual email, the Slack message is not worth spending a couple more minutes on. It's just an email or it's just a Slack message." The problem with that line of thinking is that no one instance of something is ever going to feel important enough to spend a little bit more time on that. And then, but when you zoom out, that's like, "Well that's all your work then. This is literally everything you've touched. This is all your work output then." because any piece of that process you thought wasn't worth spending time on and now this is just the quality of your work and it's not as good as it could be.

(00:37:15):
So yes, these might seem minor but A, it compounds. And also B, all the "big things," everyone else is already doing. So, there's not a lot of alpha in that. Whereas if you are paying attention to skills that people think are boring or too basic and realizing that's a lever that you can pull, that someone else thought, "Oh, we're hitting diminishing returns on that. I'm not going to spend more time on that." But you realize that there's actually more juice left to squeeze there and you decide to squeeze that juice. Well, now, you have extra juice that the other person doesn't have.

(00:37:56):
So yeah, in my experience I find that people claim the point of diminishing returns way too early. And this isn't just for communication, this is for strategies, tactics, et cetera. They'll try something once, a mediocre attempt and be like, "This channel doesn't work. This tactic doesn't work." It's like, "Really? Because it's working for a lot of other people who are getting really creative with it."

(00:38:19):
I'm not saying that everything has to work for you but for you to claim, "This thing just doesn't work," feels a little bit intellectually dishonest. It's more likely that your skill level, your creativity, your execution ability was not good enough. And that's fine. Let's admit that to ourselves because if we admit that, then we can do the hard work of getting better at those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
It feels like if you really boil this down, all the advice comes down to just spend a little more time on all these things you're putting out.

Wes Kao (00:38:51):
I like thinking about it as a little bit more upfront investment. And it is an investment. It's not just time. It's an investment because yes, it takes a little bit longer to make a Slack message a little bit better, but net, net if you save a bunch of questions and back and forth and people asking you things that you don't think they should be asking, then by investing a little bit of upfront effort, you've prevented all that from happening. So yeah, it is a little bit more time in the moment but reaps a lot of benefits down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):

(00:40:42):
You mentioned Slack. I have a great quote also about you that I didn't read that I'm just going to read right now from someone that worked with you. She said she searched the Slack channel at the company you worked at for old posts from Wes for inspiration for what to ask you. And she said you had zero half-baked thoughts, 100% complete sentences, perfect punctuation, clear takeaways at the top of every message. It's the kind of thing you don't notice in isolation, but once you see everyone else's messages in a remote-first company, it's a stark contrast.

Wes Kao (00:41:14):
Yeah, thank you. I will also say that as someone who tries to walk the talk, I feel like I get a pretty good response rate pretty quickly for the things that I ask for, for the recommendations I'm making. It's not instant, it's not 100%, but over time I've realized that improving my communication has led to people receiving my ideas better. Ideas that used to be locked in my head that I would get frustrated that no one else understood. People were now understanding and that feels really good. That's very, very exciting and it made me want to do it more and pay more attention to that. So that's going back to what I said earlier about watching for what's working. There's momentum is really encouraging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):
And I totally feel that. If you start getting the things you want, that feels great. I'd be like, "Okay, cool."

Wes Kao (00:42:08):
Yeah, more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
"Let's do more of that." Yeah, and again, it's like very minor things. It's like a couple more minutes on the Slack message, a couple more minutes on email.

Wes Kao (00:42:16):
Very doable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):
Yeah, which everyone can do. There's no magic here, it's just spend a little more time and use some of these tactics that we're talking about. Speaking of that, let me talk about another tactic. Apparently you have some really good advice on finding the right level of confidence in what you're saying. There's always this question of, "I come to this leader. How confident should I be about, 'This is the answer,' versus, 'Here's a bunch of ideas'?" What do you think? What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:42:41):
I find that people tend to naturally be on the spectrum a little bit too confident as a baseline or not confident enough. So people who are too confident might state hypotheses as if they are fact. So that really bothers me. That's another one of my pet peeves, where if you say, "This is X," or, "This will X," that is different than saying, "This could X," or, "This might X," or, "This will increase the likelihood of X."

(00:43:12):
So I'm a big proponent of speaking accurately. You can avoid a lot of problems if you speak accurately about your level of conviction and about the actual amount of evidence that you have for something. It's okay for something to be an initial hunch. Say, "It's an initial hunch." Don't act like this is something that you are super sure about. You've proven out that this is absolutely this way because the rest of your team is listening to you at face value. And y'all might spend real headcount and dollars pursuing something that you have advocated for in a way where you overreached with your level of confidence.

(00:43:52):
So, that's for people who are overconfident. It's equally a problem if you're under-confident. So I have some clients who their CEO asked them to share some recommendations with another team because they've run something before and so they share all this amazing information and at the end they're like, "Oh, but you can ignore everything I just said. Obviously, make your own decision. Do what you think is best. And if you want to just ignore everything, that's totally cool too." And it's like you just didn't have to say that. You could say, "Make your own decision, take all this into account," but you don't have to diminish to that degree.

(00:44:31):
And so again, speaking accurately, if you have really strong reasons to recommend something to the cross-functional team, it's almost irresponsible to act like you are not really sure and it's just this random idea, "Hey, try it if you want to." We might lose a lot of money and time if we don't take this idea, right? So again, speaking accurately is so, so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
Is a simple way to think about then the right balance is have a point of view, have a recommendation, present accurate facts, and be clear when you are not? "It's not actually 100% true, but here's a hunch I have, or here's a theory we have."

Wes Kao (00:45:11):
Yeah, I think sharing a point of view, sharing a recommendation, and then backing it up with evidence, with logic, with first principles, with examples, with data, if you have it. Not every situation you're going to have data for, especially if you're building something new. So this is where first principles comes in. Even explaining how you got to where you got to and why you think this is going to work, that all gives your team, your manager, something to push back on, to poke holes on or to align on and say, "Yeah, I agree here, but I disagree on this part."

(00:45:44):
So you can talk about ideas with a lot more specificity when you share your thought process. And you can frame it all kicking off saying, "My initial thinking is," or, "Based on what we know, my hunch is, blank." So speaking accurately and then still bringing up those facts so that we can all make as informed of a decision as we can make given what we know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Advice I got that really helped here for me was to try not to be biased with how you frame everything. You have your suggestion for how to do something. It's easy to just bias all of the data to point in that direction. And if people notice that, they're like, "Oh, okay. Well, I can't really trust this because I see you're just like, you clearly have an agenda." So it's a little bit like having an agenda and a POV, but be clear about what is actually true. Be accurate.

Wes Kao (00:46:36):
Yeah. I think anytime people have to discount what you're saying because you are biased in this way is not great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:45):
Is there an example by any chance that highlights what you're describing here?

Wes Kao (00:46:49):
Yeah, so in my course I talk about not being a single-minded martyr. So single-minded martyr is someone who very much has an agenda, who wants the recommendation to go through and is presenting a bunch of evidence, supporting that direction. And then gets really frustrated when other people are not seeing it or are skeptical. And so one of my clients was a single-minded martyr in a recommendation she was making. So she was on the growth acquisition side of her company. And was having trouble with cross-functional team members lending headcount to her project. And so everyone would say like, " Oh, yes, we believe in this, this is important," but wouldn't want to actually give her half of their engineer for two weeks.

(00:47:36):
And we were talking about it and as we were talking, she revealed that the CEO had at the beginning of the year said that the company-wide goal is retention that year. That their biggest challenges and areas of opportunity were in retention, not necessarily in growth. And once she zoomed out and realized this, she was able to put her recommendation in context. And realized that it's not just-

Wes Kao (00:48:00):
... recommendation in context. And realize that it's not just I'm the only one who cares about this company. Everyone is a hypocrite. They say they believe this, but don't actually want to work on it. Before that was kind of her narrative, but once she zoomed out and realized she was being a single [inaudible 00:48:16], she could better fit her proposal in the context of what else was happening in the organization. I think actually this is a really big difference between more junior people versus more senior people. More junior people are like, "I need to win. I need to get a yes for this proposal and I'm going to keep advocating for it until I get a yes." Whereas really sometimes the best decision for the company is not right now. This doesn't actually fit our priorities right now, right?

(00:48:42):
Or maybe yes, but let's right size the level of investment. So it might look like half whatever the size of what that recommendation actually was, and having the maturity to realize that, to put your idea into context is huge. That took me a really long time to learn and I think that goes under the umbrella of always do what's best for the company, not necessarily what's best for me, my career, my team, my wins. If you prioritize what's best for the company, that helps you have a more right-sized way of still advocating for your ideas, but doing it with a bit more equanimity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
And also just connecting to what the company is. Just this idea of if the thing you're pitching is not aligned with what is important to the company right now, it's unlikely to be prioritized. It makes sense. This is why leaders choose, here's what matters most. We got to do the things that are going to help us drive this thing right now, like retention or revenue. And so that's just, I think, a sub tactic there is just whenever you're pitching something, connect that to the goal of the person you're pitching to so that they're like, "Oh, I see how this is going to help me. That's great. Let's do it. Great advice."

(00:50:01):
And I think this is something a lot of people run into. It's just, "Why aren't they listening to me? Why don't they want... That's such a good idea. They hate me." It's something, "Oh, I bet they hate me. They don't trust me." When it's just like, okay, this isn't a priority right now. Let's come back to it another time. Okay. I'm going to get to a couple more tactics and then I'm going to shift directions to talk about managers and being manager. You have an awesome framework called MOO. What is MOO? What does it stand for and what is it all about?

Wes Kao (00:50:26):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. M-O-O. And the thought there is that a lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get, especially in meetings where we feel blindsided, that was unexpected, and then we're on our back foot. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get when I share this, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. So are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely. And so this is where knowing your own argument in and out, including counterarguments becomes so important. So knowing your counterarguments as well as you know the arguments for doing the thing. When you do that, when you have prepared in that way, you're less likely to feel caught off guard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
When you hear you talk about this, it's like, obviously I shouldn't do this, but very few people actually do this, actually spend a couple minutes, " Okay, here's what I'm going to pitch."

Wes Kao (00:51:31):
Even a couple seconds, really. Really, even a couple seconds, your brain will think of something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:38):
Is there a story or an example of this that you share that highlights this idea of the power of MOO?

Wes Kao (00:51:43):
I use MOO multiple times a day, every day, every single day. Literally whatever I'm about to say I think how might someone disagree with this or what might an objection be? So whatever it is I'm writing, saying, it's a really good mental filter because it encourages you to think a couple steps ahead in kind of a structured way, right? If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me. Well, if I take that into account, I can volunteer that information upfront or I can frame it in a way where they're less likely to think that that's an issue.

(00:52:19):
And so it's muscle memory for me at this point, and this might be something we include at the end is something to start with. But putting MOO on a post-it, Most Obvious Objection, what is someone likely to object about? And then just keeping that top of mind. It's a great way to train yourself to empathize with your audience and with your recipient. We all say that and we all know we should do it, but for me this is a really tactical concrete way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:50):
I think what's great about a lot of the tactics you're sharing is not only is it going to help you communicate it better, but it helps you actually think and crystallize it better for yourself because you may realize, oh, that's a really good objection. Like, oh, the objection's probably going to be this. Will it drive enough impact for the business? Oh, that's a great point. Maybe I should not pitch this right now.

Wes Kao (00:53:10):
Yeah. It definitely helps shape your own thinking. I think communication and thinking are so much more interrelated than we think. I think people think there's a thinking as phase one and then communicating the thinking, and the reality is a lot more intertwined. And I loved your example there that thinking ahead to what might be the most obvious objection actually then prompts you to realize that maybe there was a gap in what you were planning to present and then you now have an opportunity to strengthen that pitch before you say it out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
There's a quote I have highlighted on this podcast a number of times that I love that is exactly along these lines by Joan Didion. "I don't know what I think until I write it down." I know exactly that feeling. Okay. So there's a couple more things that people have shared that you are amazing at helping them get better at. One is just keeping your cool and staying calm during very high stakes, real-time conversations when things maybe aren't going your way or if you disagree with someone, any advice on that, it feels like you're really good at this.

Wes Kao (00:54:17):
I think one thing that tends to throw people off is putting a lot of pressure on themselves to get the exact right answer. So if they are asked a question and they don't know the answer, a lot of people will then kind of freak out. And I was taught early in my career that if you don't know the answer, you should say, "Let me look into it, I'll get back to you." So that's a fine approach. It's definitely better than making something up, right? So definitely don't make something up. But if you are more experienced and have some confidence in your subject matter area, just saying I'll get back to you, is sometimes a missed opportunity. You can ask for a bit more information to be able to continue the conversation in that moment. So let's say that your exec says what percentage of users came from mobile last month and you don't have that number off the top of your head.

(00:55:20):
So person A says, "Let me look into it and I'll get back to you." Person B might say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter the number has been 60 to 70% and it's grown in the past year, so mobile is now a bigger part of our business, et cetera. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately or where's that commission coming from, basically? Right? And so being able to answer a similar question in the direction you think the person is asking about and then validating why they're asking that question allows you to still continue that conversation in the moment. I call it the question behind the question, sometimes you get a question, but underneath there's a deeper underlying concern.

(00:56:10):
And many times people don't even know that it's there, right? Subconscious. So it's not nefarious, they're not withholding anything from you. But when you are explaining something and you're kind of getting multiple questions on the same thing, it's a good sign that there might be a deeper question behind the question and it's our responsibility to figure out what might that be. And so probing, asking for a bit more information, answering in that general direction and then validating these are all techniques you can use when you are in the moment without feeling like, oh, I must have every single thing prepared and the moment that I'm caught off guard, everything goes to shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
Another tactic along these lines that's very similar to what you're describing, but I'll share that I learned that was really helpful is just if you're not sure what to say, basically just reflecting back their question and just being like, let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for. You want to understand monthly retention for, and then maybe clarify. And that one gives you time to think about it as you're talking. Two, it helps the person recognize, "Oh, he hears me. Great. Okay, this is good. He's thinking about this." And then at the end of that you could be like, "Okay. I don't actually have that specific number. Let me think about it." Or, "I have the quarterly number. Okay. That's what I know." So there's an interim step almost that I'll add into your piece of advice of just reflect back their question, just better understand what they're looking for.

Wes Kao (00:57:32):
Yeah, I love that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:34):
Awesome. Okay, let's go back to what I said we do. Let's pick one tactic that you think people should try first, maybe one or two. So let me read the ones we've gone through and then see what you think would be a good first step. So one is starting with sales, before getting to logistics and giving people the why signposting using specific words to help people guide the doc and not get overwhelmed. Finding the right level of confidence, having a POV, that sort of thing. Getting better, being concise, MOO, not overusing formatting, something else you shared. And then this idea of when you don't know the answer, not saying I'll get back to you as the default, maybe giving them a different answer, maybe asking them more questions. Across those, which do you think someone should try to like, "Okay. Let me start here."

Wes Kao (00:58:25):
I would start with Most Obvious Objection and also framing your conversation up front. And that kind of relates to using signposting words if needed to help you frame that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:37):
Sweet. That's such an easy one to remember. Just MOO. Okay. So stick a post it somewhere when you're about to share something in Slack and ask someone for something, present in a meeting, send a strategy, and just think about for a few seconds what might be the most obvious objection to what I'm trying to ask them to do. Great. Okay. So let's talk about management. And there's kind of two sides to it. Being a manager and being a person reporting to a manager, you have a bunch of really good advice here. One is there around managing up. One of my most popular posts in the early days was advice for managing up and just how important it is. What advice do you have for someone to get better at managing up? Why is that even so important? Why do you think people may be under appreciating how important it is to manage your manager, let's say.

Wes Kao (00:59:18):
One of the most common myths about managing up that I definitely felt early on in my career was that I would have to manage up if I were more junior, but eventually I would outgrow it, that I would get senior enough that I would no longer have to do it. And it was a rude awakening that no matter how senior I got, managing up, I not only had to manage up, it actually became more important. So I think managing up is one of those skills that if you invest in learning it, it serves you now and for the rest of your career. And I realize that many senior people are actually the best at managing up. That's partially how they got to be so senior in the first place. But also, the more senior you get, the less likely that your manager is going to give you really well-defined tasks and problems on a silver platter and ask you to solve them.

(01:00:09):
You are going to be dealing with more ambiguity and you're going to be dealing with sometimes a mandate like make this number go up or create this division, right? Where you need to manage up and make sure that your leader, your manager, is in the loop about what you are about to try and what you're about to do and make sure that they're aligned. And so for me, realizing that managing up is something that is ongoing and that it shifts and evolves and looks different as you go in your career, that was a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
Just that even if you become even a VP, if you become a director and still something you want to invest in, any specific tactic or advice for how to manage up well.

Wes Kao (01:00:54):
The biggest one is to share your point of view. So this some people are surprised by because they think I'm going to say do a weekly recap of the tasks that you worked on or what you contributed. And that is a good idea, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I think the more highly leveraged way to contribute and manage up is by being more vocal about sharing your point of view. When you just ask your manager, "Hey manager, what should we do?" You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" You give them something to build off of and that reduces the amount of mental lift that they have to put forth.

(01:01:54):
And so sharing your point of view more readily, backing it up with evidence, that's a wonderful way of making your manager's life easier. And also showing that you are an active rigorous thinker who is thinking strategically about the business. You're not just waiting to be told what to do, you're not expecting them to figure things out and then tell you you are actively looking around the corner trying to solve problems, forming hypotheses in your mind, observing and noticing things. And again, sharing your point of view doesn't mean that you have the perfect answer. You can share that, "Hey, I've noticed this problem popping up in a couple of different places. Here's what I think might be happening."

(01:02:36):
Or when you share a report, don't only share the report and expect your manager to come up with insights and takeaways. You should look at the report too and point out insights and takeaways. So it's really changing that posture from more reactive and more waiting to be told what to do or kind of staying in this narrow box to being willing to share your recommendation, your point of view, share what you're noticing, and this is something that even junior people could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:04):
I was going to say exactly that. I think not only is it something junior people can do, this is a really good way to get promoted and to take on more leadership opportunities. You coming to your manager with, "Here's something I think we should do. Here's a perspective I have. Here's an opportunity." If you were in charge, you're like, how awesome would it be for people to come to me with amazing ideas and have clear recommendations? That sounds great. Everyone wants that. So if you can do that, amazing. Who wouldn't want that? But then what's interesting is similar to how writing helps you crystallize your thinking, you coming in with a recommendation forces you to really think deeply about it because that's putting your reputation on the line. So there's a second order effect of it makes you actually spend more time on the thing and be clear about why you think this is a good idea and do more research. So a lot of wins here.

Wes Kao (01:03:53):
There are a lot of situations where you might have the most visibility into a problem. You might have the most proximity into an issue. And so if you're not speaking up about it and sharing what you're observing, sharing what you're noticing, your manager doesn't necessarily have visibility into that. And so I've heard so many managers say that they want their junior people to speak up more because their junior people have often close contact with customers, with support tickets, with cleaning data, with a bunch of things where the manager would love to hear insights from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
If you're not having success with this, if you're hearing this and be like, but it never worked, my manager doesn't listen to me, listen to the rest of this podcast we just did, which is basically advice on how to effectively convince someone of a thing. It's like, tell them why this is a problem, be really concise about it, sign post words, all these things. That's exactly what this whole conversation's been about. Okay. Let's see. We have a couple more really cool tactics that people have suggested we talk about. One is how to give feedback well, how to do better, how to be more effective at giving feedback. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (01:05:05):
I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression. And so the idea here is that most of the time, by the time we are giving feedback to someone, we have been frustrated for a while. I used to be very conflict diverse, so I would wait and try to convince myself that I wasn't bothered by something until I really couldn't hold it in anymore. Then I would schedule a one-on-one with a coworker to tell them the feedback and it would inevitably turn into a venting session where I was in the name of sharing the impact of what they did would share all my frustrations and all the ways that they have basically harmed me and made my life difficult. And this would be very counterproductive because the person would either feel like and feel really demoralized or they'd get really defensive and they'd want to argue with me about how what they did actually was not that bad or it was partially my fault too or whatever.

(01:05:59):
And so I realized that a better way of giving feedback is thinking about motivating the person's behavior change. The goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change, help them understand the benefit to them as well as to the people around them. And so usually for me, that's trimming 90% of the initial stuff that I want to say and really keeping only that 10%. And that's made a really big difference. Whenever I am giving constructive feedback of any kind, I always keep that in mind. And when I don't do it, I almost always regret it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Someone close to me in my life is working on the skill, which is there's just, "I want people to know how they messed up. Justice. I need this to be fair." And what I always recommend is just think about what you want to get out of this conversation, what do you want from them? And then, okay, what's the best way to get that? Versus just making sure they hear you and making sure they understand how screwed up this was. And that's basically what you're saying is focus on the outcome you want to achieve, not something that's useful, something that will make you just feel better.

Wes Kao (01:07:23):
Yeah. I definitely think that having a space to vent and to share those frustrations is important. So you want to get that out before you go into the conversation with your counterpart. So whether it's talking to your therapist or your partner or friend, you want to basically get all that energy out because otherwise you bring it into the conversation and it doesn't take much to set you off. You might have a whole script, you're controlled, you're calm, and then you start talking and the other person raises an eyebrow and is acting a little incredulous at what you're saying, and that's all it takes for you to snap and be like, "You're surprised? You're incredulous? Why are you incredulous?" Right? And then you're off, right? Yeah. Getting that energy out, I would say step one, so that you can go into the conversation clear, grounded, setting that emotional tone that is more positive and that allows you to stay focused on only the part that will get them to behave in the way you want them to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Such good advice. And I think we come back to are you getting the outcomes you want? If you're not, this is another reason it might be the case is you just need them to hear your mind. I just need you to know. And I think a lesson here is that may not be the best path to getting what you want, but it may feel good. Maybe people are like, "Ah, but I really want them to know this."

Wes Kao (01:08:42):
There's that great Einstein quote about insanity being repeating things that you're doing expecting a different outcome. And I feel like that applies so much to the workplace and to communication. Most of us have certain patterns that we are used to and certain ways of responding, and if you believe that there is untapped upside that whatever you are at is kind of a local maximum and that there's better out there, then that's where switching things up could be useful and not just doing everything that you've been doing and getting the same result that you might be getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
This resonates with Toby Lutke when he is doing the podcast, talked about how... He had this quote that I love that just "No human in history has come anywhere near their potential and everyone is way, way, way better than they think are," and these are really cool tactics and really effective ways to actually get closer to your potential. Okay. Two more things I want to talk about real quick. One is your advice on delegating, but also continuing to have high standards. This is something I spent a lot of time on because a lot of people don't delegate because they're afraid it's not going to be as great. I just want this to be really good. I don't trust that it's going to go as well. If I did it my way, it'd be great. So just advice on how to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards.

Wes Kao (01:10:04):
Yeah. I have a framework called CEDAF. C-E-D-A-F.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:08):
Mm-hmm. I love all these acronyms.

Wes Kao (01:10:09):
It's kind of like Cedar, but with an F at the end. I need acronyms for myself. All of these are really reminders for myself because I need a short way to remind myself. So CEDAF stands for the C is comprehension. So have I given this person that I'm delegating to everything that they need to understand what it is that I want them to do. That includes more simple things like logins to all the right software tools that they need to look up, whatever you need to look up. And understanding what the end result should look like, right? So that's all under C for comprehension. E is excitement. Am I explaining this in a way that is making this as exciting as it could be? There are a lot of tasks that aren't inherently that exciting, but by explaining the why behind we're doing this or why it's important to the project we're working on, that makes people more likely to understand and be excited about how this fits into everything.

(01:11:06):
So E is for excitement. D is for de-risk. Am I de-risking any obvious risks from delegating this? So usually when I ask clients this, they immediately think of something. They're like, "Oh yeah, I wouldn't want my direct report to spend a ton of time going in the wrong direction, filling out a hundred rows of the spreadsheet if actually it took longer than we expected." Okay, great. If that's a risk, then maybe you have them do 10 rows, see how long it takes, see if we need all the information that they're actually gathering, and then regroup, right? So what's an obvious risk? Another might be I can see this person misunderstanding and thinking I'm looking for this where I'm really looking for that. Okay, perfect. Just tell them, "When I explain this, you might think I mean this, but really I don't want that. I actually want this," right? So just vocalize it. The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to-

Wes Kao (01:12:00):
The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to speak up and make sure we are actually aligned, that they're picking up what I'm putting down? Because you might be explaining a bunch of stuff, but how much are they actually absorbing? You won't ever know if you wrap up your little spiel and then say, "Okay, go off. Come back to me when you're done." So give people a chance to ask questions to see what parts are resonating, what parts they might be a little bit confused on. Usually, when I do this, it's amazing. Because my team member will say, "What did you mean by this part? How does this part fit in?" I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot to mention this thing." Or, "Oh yeah, I didn't even really explain that well." Okay, so let's go into that.

(01:12:42):
And then F is feedback. How can you have the shortest feedback loop possible? I am a huge fan of shorting the feedback loop as much as possible and then shortening it again. So even within that initial conversation where I'm delegating something, instead of waiting a week, what if we waited a day and checked in on the initial direction that person was going? And let's do it even more. What if after I finished explaining, at the end of that conversation, we brainstormed a couple things that, that person wants to do? So within this same conversation, I'm delegating, I'm already getting a sense of, where do you want to go with this? Once you start, do you see any bottlenecks?

(01:13:24):
And so just really keeping that feedback loop super tight. I found that when I run through the CDAP acronym, there's usually one letter that I could amp up a little bit more like, oh, I didn't really put much thought into making this exciting for the person. How can I connect this to their career goals or to the company's priorities this quarter or to something else? So it's a nice mental checklist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
So much of your advice comes back to this idea that we've touched on a couple of times. We just spend a little bit more time upfront. Is that how you described it, a little more time upfront?

Wes Kao (01:13:56):
Yeah, a little bit more time. A little bit more of an investment upfront.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
Upfront to save you tons of time later. Okay. So as you described this, I don't know if you're realizing this, but you're basically just helping people work better with AI and agents. This framework is exactly I think what people need to effectively delegate to this future world of this agent world of society of agents doing work for us. Basically, you're going to be delegating to these agents in the future, and this framework is a really cool way to frame it. So think about it. Am I communicating this well, comprehension? So CDAP. Comprehension is, again, can I make this clear? Is that the way to think about that?

Wes Kao (01:14:41):
Yeah. Can I make this clear? Does this person have everything they need to be able to accomplish what I am asking them to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):
Okay. And then it's communicate why you're excited about this, basically the why. And it's interesting, there's this funny prompt technique I've learned, prompting engineering technique of just telling the AI, "This is very important to my job." Just using that sentence, it does it better.

Wes Kao (01:14:47):
Oh, interesting, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:04):
It takes it more seriously. It's just so weird. I have a post about this, and that's one of the pieces of advice, just tell me why this is important. I think people take it to the extreme as someone will die if you don't get this right. That actually works.

Wes Kao (01:15:16):
That is extreme. Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
It's wild. Okay, so CEDF, comprehension, excited, de-risk, think about ways you can de-risk, which is moot, basically. What's the most? It's a similar concept. Just think ahead to what might go wrong. Make sure you're aligned, which is quite important in the AI space. Make sure you're aligned. And feedback, get a quick feedback cycle. And it's interesting with deep research on some of these AI tools now, it's like, "I'm off for half an hour. See you." And I imagine more and more of them will check in with you as it's going and ask you questions. I used deep research recently and it's really good at just like, okay, let me have five questions for you before I go off and do this work just to clarify what you want.

Wes Kao (01:15:58):
Yeah, I found that AI will often shorten the feedback loop and align with you as well. When you prompt it, when it comes back, it will not do the entire task for me, sometimes. It'll say, "I've done the first part of this. Does this sound right? Is this what you're looking for? If so, I will complete the next section." And then sometimes I'm like, "Do the whole thing. Just stop trying to conserve energy and just do. I want you to do the whole thing." But that's what it's doing, it's breaking it into smaller chunks to de-risk that it's going to use all this bandwidth to process this thing and I'm going to say, "Oh, that's not what I was looking for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
I'm going to come back to AI real quick, but before I do that, I have one more question for you, but let me just say, I feel like we've discovered an AI version of your course now. Basically, how to delegate well to AI agents that I think people are going to find really valuable, planting a seed. Okay. Before we get back to AI, you have this other concept that I love that I actually learned from you years ago when I was working on my course called the swipe file. Swipe file, what is a swipe file? What is that about? What can it help you with? Why should people be doing this?

Wes Kao (01:17:03):
Yeah. So swipe files are really common for marketers, and I think other functions haven't caught on as much, but I think it is really, really useful. And basically a swipe file is collecting inspiration that you can refer back to later on. So some marketers will collect examples of copy, landing pages, ads, et cetera. For me, I have a file, an Apple Notes, file called Smart Things People Have Said, where I will basically paste in phrases, words, things people have said that I thought were well articulated or sounded really intelligent or sounded strategic. And I don't actually go back and look through my swipe file very often, I think other people do, but for me, even the act of adding it to my swipe file, I've already gotten value from it because it's training me to be more alert to noticing when something is working well.

(01:18:01):
I think there's so much happening around us all the time that your coworker says something smart and you're like, "Oh, that was nice," and then you keep moving on. But when you stop and pause and think, oh, that was really effective, let me add it to my file, and also think about, why was that effective and is that something I can borrow? So in my course, I encourage folks to create a work journal where they can jot down some of these observations, some of these phrases, and basically encourage yourself to be more alert to things you can borrow from other people all around you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Something else about the swipe file, you use quotes. It could be screenshots of cool designs. It could be strategy docs you found to be really effective. It could be conversion flows that are really cool. It could be just whatever you're interested in.

Wes Kao (01:18:52):
Yeah. And the great thing about that is you can then go back and analyze it and break down the structure, break down the argument, break down why was this so effective? Whereas if you're not capturing it, it's easy to just move on to the next thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Yeah, cool. And I did this for a while. I stopped, to be honest, but I really want to be doing this. So this is maybe some homework or something, because I know a lot of people stick with it, is just start like a folder or a Notes, note, whatever you use for your note-taking, and just start throwing stuff in there. And it could be messy, right? It's just like, throw it in.

Wes Kao (01:19:27):
It can be super messy. I was going to say, my back end system is super messy and it's fine. It's not a problem I need to be solving. It works. I find things I need to find. So I like having as simple of a process as possible. So Apple Notes, I open it. It's just on my home screen, I just add something. I'm not tagging anything, I'm not putting it in certain rows and filling information out. I'm just including it in a file, and if I want to go back and look at it, it served its purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:58):
Awesome. Okay, so last question. AI, I'm going to just come back to this briefly. We have this segment on the podcast called AI Corner, and we touched on this already, but I'm just curious how you have found AI to be useful in your work or your life, whether it's helped you become a better communicator? Is there anything you can share that might be helpful to folks?

Wes Kao (01:20:18):
Yeah. I love Claude. There are days when I talk to Claude for three or four hours prompting as a thought partner. So yeah, I think that AI is really helpful for an initial draft of something to bounce off of. Sometimes I'll paste in an email that I am not quite sure how to respond to and ask Claude, "Tell me draft reply." And I'll usually give it some direction. So I found that sharing my point of view makes the output way better. If I just give it something and say, "What would you say?" It's just not as good. Whereas if I say, "I am not sure about how to tell this person no, because I previously said yes and so I feel on the hook, but history has changed and so is there a nice way where I can be really respectful of our relationship and also make them feel seen and heard, but decline?"

(01:21:19):
So if I explain, "That's the problem I'm dealing with and here's what I would ideally like to be able to do," Claude comes back to something that's pretty good. And then from there I'll edit it to my voice because usually it's a little bit too formal sounding. And so I'll make some edits and then I'll share it back to Claude and say, "What do you think of this version? Would you make any improvements?" And then we go back and forth from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:41):
Wes, this is the most useful thing I've ever heard.

Wes Kao (01:21:44):
[inaudible 01:21:44].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:45):
I need this and I need this immediately, just nice ways to say no to stuff. This needs to be an extension that I can have in my browser, just, "Help me say no to this, please." Wow, such a great idea. Okay, good one. Okay, great. Wes, is there anything else? We've gone through a lot. I imagine the answer is no, but before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Wes Kao (01:22:11):
No, I feel like we covered a bunch of great frameworks, principles, so lots for folks to get started.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
All the things. And I love that so much of this will apply to being more effective with AI tools and I feel like people can go through this again and just through that lens of, how will this helped me get more out of Claude and ChatGPT? I bet so much of this will actually apply and I feel like there's an interesting course there. With that, Wes, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Wes Kao (01:22:39):
All right,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Are you ready?

Wes Kao (01:22:41):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Okay. First question, what are a couple books that you recommend most to other people?

Wes Kao (01:22:46):
One is High Output Management by Andy Grove, which is a classic. Another one is Your Brain At Work by Dr. David Rock. And that one is all about better understanding your own brain and attention span so that you can allocate your mental resources appropriately. So that one's great. Ever since reading that, I hide my phone from view because there have been studies that show that even seeing your phone in the corner of your eye, it's distracting. And I do the hardest things earlier in the day when you have more cognitive resources available. So that one's really good. Yeah, those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
These are great. I completely get that phone thing. I'm just looking at my phone, I'm like, "Dang, get out of here. Just go away."

Wes Kao (01:23:36):
I will stick it under my pillow on the couch or hide it under a notebook. It's huge. I'm always hiding my phone so it's not in my line of sight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:47):
I think Arianna Huffington has a product you can buy that's a little bed for your phone that you put to bed before you go to bed in a different room and it has a charger attached.

Wes Kao (01:23:54):
Oh, that's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:55):
So cute, so cute.

Wes Kao (01:23:57):
I don't know if I need a separate bed for my phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:01):
But it's like a ritual, I guess, and there's some theory behind it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Wes Kao (01:24:08):
I love Anything by Harlan Coben on Netflix. Basically, I don't even remember any specific movies or a TV series, but anything he puts out, he's an author and then they've turned a lot of his books into mystery thriller TV series, and anything he puts out becomes number one on Netflix. And I appreciate that he gives the people what they want, that he knows his craft, he knows his genre. And yeah, he just has so many bangers. And I don't remember any specific one, but if it's a Harlan Coben show, I know it's going to be good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:46):
I'm looking at a list now I just Googled real quick. So it's all scary stuff, right?

Wes Kao (01:24:49):
Yeah, they're mystery thrillers, and I think he does a good job playing with time and revealing information over time. It's usually something about someone's past that is now coming to haunt them, and so he'll skip between present day to the past and then slowly reveal stuff. And there's always a twist at the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:11):
There's a page, the Harlan Coben Collection on Netflix. That we'll link to that has all this stuff. I've never heard of this, so this is great. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Wes Kao (01:25:22):
I recently started using an electric toothbrush and it's been life-changing. So my husband got one and then a couple weeks later he gifted me one, and I was like, "Wow, this is actually really nice."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:34):
Are you a Sonicare person, Oral-B person, or something else?

Wes Kao (01:25:37):
It's Oral-B but I've not tried any other brand. That was one that our dentist gifted my husband this electric toothbrush because he did Invisalign. And I'm sure Invisalign is every dentist's dream.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:51):
Margins.

Wes Kao (01:25:52):
I feel like every time I get a cleaning, the dentist is like, "So have you thought about, are you interested in Invisalign?" I'm like, "No." And so when they get a yes, I'm sure they're really excited, and then they lock you in, the brand locks you in with these replacement toothbrush heads that are way more expensive than they should be. So it's a whole razor and blades, ink cartridge and printer model here. So I was horrified by how expensive these replacement heads were.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:18):
But you got a free toothbrush. I think the Oral-B is what I use, but I think that's what the Wirecutter recommended, but it's so loud. I don't know. One of them is just really loud. I think it's the Oral-B, but it's better, apparently. I went with Wirecutter, but it's so loud. I feel like there needs to be a Wirecutter for good design and experience...

Wes Kao (01:26:37):
Ooh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:37):
... versus just the optimal efficient version. Anyway, let's keep going. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you repeat yourself and share with folks?

Wes Kao (01:26:51):
Yes. I actually have many, but I'll share two. One is everything takes longer than you think. So this applies whether you are calling customer support for something or running an errand or building your career, building skills. I find it's useful to add buffers for yourself. This applies for launches too. Just assume it will take longer than you think and you'll be less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That connects to everything we've been talking about. Just spend a little more time upfront to make it. And maybe if you spend more time front, it'll take less time than you think.

Wes Kao (01:27:25):
The other one is a riff on always be closing, like Glengarry Ross. "It's always be selling." This does not mean pawning your wares, but rather putting forth effort into convincing the other person of whatever your recommendation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):
Love them. Okay, final question. So you've been a long time, I hate this word operator, but I guess that's the way people describe this, where you've just been working at companies, building companies, and you recently left that just to become creative person. Started a course on Maven. You do executive coaching, things like that. Any just lessons or a lesson from that jump that might be helpful to folks that are maybe thinking about that?

Wes Kao (01:28:07):
I think when you are an in-house operator, there's a lot about your role that you have a little bit less control over, basically. There's just certain things you have to do because it comes with the territory. Whereas when you are a solo operator running your own business, doing your own thing, you have a lot of freedom to craft your work around only your strengths, only the part that you are really good at, that adds a lot of value for other people where there's market demand. And so, for me, there was a bit of a shift where when I realized that I could craft my business, my work around only the part that I'm best at, and that can be a narrow-ass slice, that's actually really, really freeing.

(01:28:54):
And so I would encourage folks to think about, what is the thing that you are extremely good at that people find super valuable, the part that you love doing most, if you could not do all the other stuff you don't want to do, and how can you think about doubling down on that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:12):
That's such an important point. And the Claude tip you shared of how to say no well is such an important ingredient into that, because so many things come at you and are interesting and enticing that it's hard to decline, that you realize, why the hell am I doing this? I can actually control where I spend time and why did I say yes to this?

Wes Kao (01:29:33):
I actually credit you with helping me come to this realization. I mentioned you on a podcast the other day about this because, do you remember when Maven was launching an important feature, I think it was our marketplace or something, and I had asked you if you wanted to go on Clubhouse to be part of the launch?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
I remember that, but I am sure I said no.

Wes Kao (01:29:59):
Okay, yeah. You said no. You said no. And I was like, "Wow. Out of curiosity, what's the thought behind it?" And you said, I'm going to bastardize this, you could correct me, but you essentially said, "I don't really like doing live public speaking type things and I've been fortunate enough to build a career where I can write, I do my podcasts, and work only on the part that I love doing. And so I'm okay saying no to these other really interesting opportunities." And I remember at that time thinking it was so groundbreaking that you could say no to something that was legitimately a cool opportunity and be really confident about it because it wasn't your core competency. It wasn't the thing you are best at. And I've really kept that in mind when opportunities come my way of, am I excited about this? Is this what I'm really good at? Can I shine in this setting? Because when you are solo, you get to choose the settings that you want to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):
That's such a cool story. I don't exactly remember that, but I am zero surprised at what I said. And the way I put it now, when folks invite me to stuff like this is I just find the ROI on my time is so not worth doing a talk, doing a fireside thing, doing another podcast. It's just like, if I can spend more time on this newsletter than the podcast, the leverage is so much higher than just doing a talk because that takes so much time. So I just have this template now that basically says what I sent you, that is, that it helps. But it's tough. It's so hard to say no. Sometimes these opportunities are so interesting and the person is like, "Wait, what?"

(01:31:37):
Because I don't think the people asking you for stuff know that I'm getting 10 of them a day, and they're like, "Oh, he said no to my talk. He doesn't want to be on my podcast. What a jerk." That's what I think. I don't know if that's what they think. But anyway. Okay, that's great. Yes, and I think I just had a post about reaching a million subscribers to the newsletter, and actually had this image of the Ikigai concept, which is exactly what you just described, which is you want to try to find the thing that you love doing, that people value, and that you can make money doing. That's the dream. And that's exactly what you have done as well. So thank you for being here, Wes. I actually think we delivered on what I thought we would. I think this is going to be one of the most highest leverage conversations we've had.

(01:32:21):
So two final questions. Where can folks find your course? I know you also do executive coaching. Where can folks learn more? And final question is just, how can folks be useful to you, Wes?

Wes Kao (01:32:33):
You can find out more at weskao.com. I linked my course to my coaching from my main page. I also post on LinkedIn as well, so you can follow me there. And I'm always looking to meet fellow operators who out about communication. So if you put any of these principles into practice, I would love to hear about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:53):
Awesome. We'll do that in the comments. They can DM you. I don't know, what's the best way to reach you on the website or Twitter?

Wes Kao (01:32:59):
Yeah, bunch of platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:02):
All the places. Okay, cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:04):
Website, email, LinkedIn, DM me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:05):
There we go. There we go. Wes, thank you so much for being here.

Wes Kao (01:33:08):
Yeah, thank you so much, Lenny.

## Transcript

Wes Kao (00:00:00):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy. I'm a big proponent of asking myself, if I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing? How could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach in writing. Any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:00:35):
I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you are just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people, and it's confusing, you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You have an awesome framework called MOO.

Wes Kao (00:00:54):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. A lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get especially in meetings, we feel blindsided. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. Are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):
Today my guest is Wes Kao. Wes co-created the Alt-MBA program with Seth Godin. She Co-Founded a company called Maven, which I often collaborate with, which makes it easy for people to host live cohort-based courses. She recently left Maven to launch her own course on Executive Communication and Influence. There's a quote that came to mind after I stopped recording this conversation with Wes by George Bernard Shaw, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

(00:01:51):
By the end of this podcast if you listen to what Wes suggests, you'll be a lot closer to becoming a world-class communicator.

Wes Kao (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm very honored to be a second-time guest.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
Very rare honor. No pressure, but I think this is going to be one of the highest leverage episodes I've done and let me tell you why I think that's the case in the newsletter and on the podcast, I often talk about just how important and how high leverage the skill of communication is to product leaders, to leaders, just to people in general. There's this quote that Boz, the CTO of Meta, he's been on the podcast, he wrote this famous blog post, "Communication is the job." And I think that's true for product people, but it's true for basically any sort of leadership role. Anyone trying to get ahead. And you are one of the best communicators I've ever met. You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. You have one of the most popular courses on Maven, on executive communication, so I'm really excited to have you here and to help people become better communicators, better at influence and all these things. So thank you again for being here.

Wes Kao (00:05:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
Okay. So something that I often do with guests on the podcast, not even often, always, I ping people that the guests have worked with and ask them, "What should I ask Wes? What should I know about Wes?" Let me read a few quotes about you in regards to your communication skills from folks that have worked with you-

Wes Kao (00:05:34):
All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
And these are three different people. Okay, so first, "Wes single handedly raised the quality of the entire company's writing by like two X across the board. I always say the best writing course I ever took was working with Wes for a year."

Wes Kao (00:06:07):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:09):
Okay. That's one.

Wes Kao (00:06:10):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:10):
"Wes never just throws things out there, she's precise with her use of language, meticulous about examining her own ideas before bringing them in front of others and knows how to make her points in a way that people will understand them and buy into them." Okay. And third, "Wes includes a reasoning with every proposal in the context behind all of her recommendations so that everyone around her learns in order of magnitude faster. This also makes her an exceptional teacher because she can clearly define what excellence is and why something is the goal, and then break down the steps and principles involved." Okay, reactions.

Wes Kao (00:06:46):
Those are really nice things. That's amazing. Yeah, thank you so much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
And these are people across different companies, so.

Wes Kao (00:06:52):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Okay, so that was just to highlight of how good you are at this stuff. And what we're going to be doing with our chat is going through a bunch of your tactics that you teach and that have helped people become better communicators, executive communicators, better at influence. Before we get into the specific tactics, is there anything that you think is important for people to understand just broadly around the skill of becoming a better communicator?

Wes Kao (00:07:17):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy, there's a lot of avoidable questions, and I'm a big proponent of asking myself, "If I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing to that?" So, you know, instead of blaming other people for not understanding me, I think about how could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have? So I'm a big proponent of agency. And realizing that we can only control our own behavior. And so the best place to start, if you're not getting the reaction you're looking for, is reflecting on how can I get better at the skill of communicating? And it absolutely is a skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
So what I'm hearing is if you're having a hard time people buying into what you're trying to convince them to do or you're finding people are doing not what you asked them to do, it's likely an issue with your ability to communicate, it's probably not their fault.

Wes Kao (00:08:28):
Yeah, I would say so. You can't solve everything with improving your communication, but you can increase the likelihood of getting what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
Cool. Okay. Anything else along these lines of just things that are important to understand just broadly around communication, executive communication?

Wes Kao (00:08:46):
I think another big one that I teach in my course and really kick off with is practicing like it's game day, playing like it's game day. So I see a lot of operators who save their best behavior for executives only. So you know, they want to shine when they're presenting to senior leadership, but with everyone else, they're kind of calling it. And I just don't think that you're going to be able to get enough reps to actually get good at executive communication if you are only doing it with executives. Because many of us only present to execs once a month, right? Or a couple of times a quarter. And that's just not a lot of chance to practice. So really treating every single stakeholder as if they are important because they are, and you shouldn't be if you don't want to waste your CEO's time, you also shouldn't waste your cross-functional team members' time or your manager's time or your direct reports' time. So that's something else that I ask to keep in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
And maybe a last question before we get into the tactics. When people think communication, they think email, they think meeting presentations, things like that. How do you think about, when you talk about executive communication and communication in general, what's kind of the umbrella of things that includes?

Wes Kao (00:09:53):
Yeah, I would say broadly the two mediums are verbal communication and written. So verbal being meetings, conversations, presentations. And written being emails, strategy docs, notion docs, Slack messages, text messages, those two categories broadly. And I also think about communication as more of a means to an end, which might be interesting for some people because I teach a course on communication. So you would think that's like the end in and of itself, but I really see it as a means to an end where the end is getting the ideal outcome you're looking for. So whether that is buy-in or making a good decision as a team or moving to the next step, whatever that might be, communication is really in service of that end goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:43):
Awesome. Okay. So I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach, and talking to folks that you've taught and folks that you've worked with. So I'm just going to go through a bunch and let's just help people get better at these things.

Wes Kao (00:10:58):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
Okay. So the first is something you call sales, then logistics. What is that about?

Wes Kao (00:11:07):
Yes. So a common mistake that I see is overestimating the amount of buy-in that you have from your audience. So that looks like jumping straight into talking about the logistics, the details of the how to do something, of the process. When in reality your audience has not yet decided if they even want to do the thing. So what I see operators do in response then is go even deeper into the logistics and the how, thinking that, "Oh, if I just explain this more than that person will want to do it." When really a sales note is different than a logistics note. A sales note is meant to get people excited to do the thing you want them to do, and to agree to do it. And only then after they have bought in, does it make sense to share the logistics.

(00:11:57):
So there's an order of operations here. If you switch the order of operations, you will likely get a slow response or just no response, right? We've all put a Slack message in a channel and got crickets and tumbleweed. So really starting off with selling the person and making sure that they know why we're doing this, why this matters to the company, why now, and then sharing the logistics tends to be a lot more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Is there an example of that that might help illustrate that point or that approach?

Wes Kao (00:12:27):
Yeah. So one of my clients is a head of operations and she was trying to get the rest of her executive team, which she was a part of, to fill in some wins for the week so that they could share this out with the whole company. And this was going to be motivating, it was going to shine a light on folks. And she led with the logistics of which document to send, to put the details in, what time to put it in by, the format that you should put these wins and didn't really get much of a response from the leadership team, which makes sense, right? Because this totally sounds like one of those things that's another item to check off on your list when you already have so many other things to do and here's this other process that like we're all supposed to do now, like yay, right? And so she wasn't really getting response. And that's because she dove straight into logistics.

(00:13:20):
Whereas what she could have done is start by selling folks, selling the other executives on why are we doing this? Well, we're doing this because this is a chance to shine a light on your team members who are doing amazing work, for them to feel motivated and to feel like the rest of the company really sees them and understands what they're doing. And this is all something that is going to motivate your team, right? So sharing why this is helpful and useful and how this is in service of you and your team versus like, "Oh, this is a favor that you're doing for me to fill out this form and fill it out this way and by this date," et cetera, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
I know that execs often want the opposite where they're just like, "Okay, I know, just tell me what you want to do. Just like, okay, just get to the point. I don't want time for all this context and background." Any advice on when to spend any time on the sales? Like what are signs that, okay, maybe you don't have them sold yet, or what are maybe contexts where you should probably still try to sell them first?

Wes Kao (00:14:20):
Yeah. So I actually think that you should always do a little bit of selling even for situations where people have generally bought in. Because most of us have a lot going on and we're not actively thinking about whatever you're talking about. So even though I agreed to something two weeks ago, by the time you're telling me about it again, like I thought about a billion other things since then, right? So reminding me of why are we talking about this? Why does this matter? And then getting into it and framing that conversation upfront is way more likely for us to not get stuck in a cold start and not kind of go two steps back one step forward.

(00:14:55):
The other thing is, you can frame a conversation and sell a bit at the beginning very concisely. So I'm not talking about spending 15 minutes out of a 30 minute meeting selling, I'm talking about one to two minutes, even a couple sentences, and then transitioning into the main thing you want to talk about. So I'm a huge proponent of doing that and basically reminding people, why are we doing this? Why are we here today? Why does this matter? And then getting into the meat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:24):
I love that. So basically you can do this really briefly, it doesn't have to be a whole pitch for half an hour. It's just a reminder, "Here's why we think this is important." And I think that's such a good point because a lot of times it's like a leader is looking at this thing you're asking them to do and they're like, "Why are we even, why am I spending time on this?" And just a reminder of like, "Okay, I see, I forgot this was going to be, this a part of our strategy, this has this much impact potential or here's how it could help our team be more efficient."

Wes Kao (00:15:52):
Yeah. And you can really do that in like 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
Is there like a, I don't know, structure to this? Is it just like why? Is there a kind of a template you like or some way you recommend of selling first? Is it like, "Here's why we're doing this." Starting like that? Anything along those lines?

Wes Kao (00:16:09):
Yeah. I think explaining why we're doing this, why this benefits the business, what problem this is solving. Again, you can do a lot of this in a couple of sentences. And then I also like asking or stating what I need from the other person upfront. So saying, "Hey, we're here today because two weeks ago we were reviewing the product flow and realized that there were a couple of parts that were kind of confusing. So I took a stab at fixing those areas, rewriting the microcopy, and I want to present them to you today, see if you agree with these changes, and then we're going to roll them out. What I'm looking for from you is feedback on the changes and if you agree." So like that was like 15 seconds, right? Super fast. And then now we're all on the same page about why we're here. And you can listen more intently knowing that I'm looking for a certain kind of feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
I would love to hear it that way. I think there's like an implication here that maybe is worth sharing of just, a lot of this is about communicating effectively to execs, which will make you communicate better to most people. But especially with folks up the ladder. They don't have a lot of time, they have a million things in their head. Maybe just share like why this is so important, like what the state of mind of a leader is that you need to kind of break through.

Wes Kao (00:17:25):
Yeah. So I call it the yes, yes, yes, next, next, next mindset where if I'm listening to direct reports present something to me, very often I find myself thinking, "Got it. All right, yes, let's keep going." Right? And you know, on the other side of that, I've often presented to executives where I had a 15 slide deck and execs would do that and I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like I have a whole sequence, I have a whole order, you know? And sometimes they would give me buy or make the decision by slide four, you know? And I'd be like, "Okay, well you know, slide 13, I want to show you this great graph I put together." Right? And what was really helpful for me was realizing that I should take the win. Okay, if five seconds already agreed, take the win and keep it moving, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):
Yeah. What's that quote like? "If you've sold them, stop talking."

Wes Kao (00:18:16):
Right. Yes. Yeah, you might talk them out of agreeing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
Yeah. Okay. You mentioned being concise. Let's talk about that. You have some really good advice on just how to effectively be concise and not too concise. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:18:31):
Yes. One of my pet peeves is when people are too concise and they equate being concise with brief, being brief. And being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about economy of words. It's about the density of the insight that you're sharing. And so you can have a 300 word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise. And so not equating concision with briefness I think is a really big one to understand.

(00:19:05):
The second thing is a lot of advice about being concise, I think misses an important point. So we've all heard, "Don't bury the lead, cut to the chase." Main point, put the main point at the top, bottom line up front, right? And all of these pithy aphorisms assume that you actually know what your core point is. So you can't cut to the chase unless you know what the chase is. You can't unbury the lead unless you know what the lead is. And so that I found is the bottleneck to being concise. It's actually not really being clear of what you are thinking, that's what's leading to being long-winded.

(00:19:49):
And you can kind of test this theory because most of us have a go-to story that we've told a bunch of times, right? We're like, you know exactly when people are going to laugh, you know when they're going to gasp or hold their breath, right? And why are you so good at telling that story and why are you so concise about it? Because you've told it a bunch of times, you know all of the beats. So in meetings though, at work, we are very rarely talking about the same thing that many times it's always something new. It's something that we are also probably likely processing ourselves and are in the midst of processing as we are in a quick turnaround time, telling someone else about it, telling our team about it. And so you are basically asking your brain to do a lot of different processes, especially in a real time conversation. You're listening to the other person absorbing, making sense of it, processing it, figuring out what you think and how you would react.

(00:20:39):
And then trying to say something cohesive that makes sense, right? And then trying to be concise about it. So it's just a lot of different processes. And so the only solution I found consistently to being concise is preparation. It's not a very glamorous solution by any means, but the clearer I am going into a meeting, going into a conversation, going into a pitch, the better I am at being concise and being able to bring the conversation back to the most important points at being able to stay flexible, but also firm and preparation. I don't mean spending hours and hours preparing for a weekly meeting, even a couple of minutes really makes a huge difference.

(00:21:25):
Most of us are so back to back in meetings that we're doing zero preparation. It's like the meeting has started 30 seconds in and you're still unwinding from the last Zoom call that you were on, right? So most of us are in that mental state. So if you even take 30 seconds to one minute to ground yourself on why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across in the time that we have, you're going to go in there so much more focused and so much more able to be concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
So the advice there, so this is for meetings and I want to talk about writing also, but for meetings, the advice here is before you get into a meeting, actually think about why am I in this meeting? What do I want to get out of it? Instead of in the meeting figuring out a lot as you go, which to your point, you're just going to ramble and be like, "Oh, okay, here's what I actually want to say."

Wes Kao (00:22:10):
Yeah. And what might I want to share in the meeting too? You know, especially for more introverted folks. Sometimes you need to decide beforehand that you want to speak and you want to make sure you get a certain point across. So even deciding that beforehand makes a huge difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:25):
Yeah, I found this extremely powerful just like five minutes before you get into a meeting. And it could happen earlier in the day, right? It doesn't have to happen right before the meeting, or worst case, it's right before the meeting. Just, "Okay, what do I want to get out of this? What am I here? What do I want to say?" And just like giving your brain a little bit of time to prepare. Super powerful. In writing, is there like any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:22:50):
I think the main tactic is to remind yourself to be concise. And usually when I do that, I end up trimming 20% at least of what I wrote, tightening up some sentences. I also ask myself, how might I be adding cognitive load to whatever it is that I'm saying? So is there a tighter, clearer, cleaner way that I can ask what I'm asking or present the information I'm presenting or make the recommendation that I'm making? And usually if you even ask yourself that, your brain automatically comes up with stuff. You just see whatever you wrote differently and you're like, "Oh shit, I could trim this entire paragraph because that's secondary." And maybe you have your primary message in Slack, and then within the thread add some of the secondary stuff, right? So I find that most of us, it's reminding yourself to be concise. And once you think of it, your brain naturally will see places where you can trim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
There's a layer of advice under this that you're not saying that I'm going to say, which is actually look at the thing you wrote at least once before you share it. Because I used to be really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. I wrote this doc, send it, get feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. We wrote this doc, send it, get feedback. All right. Send this email. I don't have time to read this email." And I find just forcing yourself to look at it solves so much of this.

Wes Kao (00:24:10):
Oh, yes, yes, definitely. I was assuming before doing that, but you're right, some people might not be. And yes, definitely reading your own message first is huge. And yeah, I find that even doing that you can often spot a lot of low-hanging fruit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Right. You'll find the typos and grammar issues and you'll be like, "Oh, I don't need this word." Along those lines, let me share two books. People always ask me, "How did you learn to write?" I'm like, "I'm not a writer, I don't know what I'm doing." But two books really helped me write more effectively. And one is specifically to help you write more concisely called On Writing Well. I don't know if you've read that.

Wes Kao (00:24:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Okay. And it's basically chapter after chapter of, "Here's what you can cut. And you can cut more. And look what more you can cut and cut this stuff." And he has screenshots of essays that students have written in his class and he's like, "Look at all those words you cut and nothing has changed. It's exactly the same message and even is better with 40% of the words cut."

Wes Kao (00:25:12):
Is this by Sol Stein or another author?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):
I don't have it... It's somewhere in my bookshelf. So we'll look it up.

Wes Kao (00:25:19):
Yeah, there's a writing book by Sol Stein that I absolutely love. And I feel like it might be called On Writing Well, but then also I could see there being multiple books called On Writing Well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
There's also Writing Well I think by Stephen King, that's another one that people love, but there On Writing Well is the one I really loved because it's very tactical.

Wes Kao (00:25:37):
Going back to something that you were saying earlier with rereading what you wrote, I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. So if you're just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people and it's confusing and you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. All 15 of these people are reading this being like, "Okay, what do I do with this?"

(00:26:05):
Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races. They would've read your message and then known exactly what to do next or what their part was or what you were looking for from them. So I think about that a lot too. It's not just me writing this and sending it off. It's, "Who are all the people who are going to come in contact with this message who are going to refer to it and use it? And if I just take 30 more seconds to make sure that it's clean, how much can I unblock from their work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:34):
That's such a good point. I like that, I love that term blast radius. It's such a good point. Just like there's so much negative leverage in writing inefficiently and inconcisely. If you spend like... Inconcisely? I don't know the word is there, but if you just spend three minutes spending a little more time making it more clear just like the impact and leverage that has, that's such a good point. I looked up the books, it's so funny. Okay, so there's On Writing Well by William Zinsser. There's Stein On Writing by Sol Stein, which is what you said you were talking about. And then Stephen King has a book called On Writing. Everyone's got the same.

Wes Kao (00:27:09):
Yeah. Common title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:12):
Not ideal for SEO but On Writing Well is the one that I love by William Zinsser. There's also one called A Series Of Short Sentences if you haven't seen that one. It's a really good rate too. It's just how to write short sentences and just the power of just keeping sentences short, which I struggle with.

Wes Kao (00:27:27):
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:28):
Okay. Back to our agenda. There's another framework/tactic that I've heard you recommend. It's called signposting. What is signposting?

Wes Kao (00:27:38):
Signposting is using certain words, phrases, formatting, and an overall structure in your writing that helps guide your reader and signals what is coming in the rest of the post. So, this is especially helpful if you have a long memo. It adds structure to where are we going and what certain sections of paragraphs are about. So some of my favorite signposting words are, "for example," shows that you're about to show an example because shows that you're about to share your logic and rationale behind something. "As a next step," is a great one. People's eyes automatically zoom to, "as a next step." Even "First, second, third," kicking off a paragraph with that, you're not needing to rely on rich text formatting with bolding, italics, underlines and all that craziness. If you kick off sentences with signposting words, you can often signal, "Here's what I'm about to talk about in this paragraph."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
These are power words for clarity. There's this whole concept of power words like, "free."

Wes Kao (00:28:47):
Yeah. "A gift."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
"Gift." Yeah. For copywriting and these are basically power words for helping your brain see the structure and get to the thing you want to pay attention to. So I'll read back the words you just used. "For example," " because," "as a next step," and then, "first, second, third."

Wes Kao (00:29:05):
Yeah. Yeah. You can use signposting in writing and verbally too. So if you're doing a product demo, you might say something like, "The most important part to pay attention to is, blank." Or, "The part that we were most surprised by is, blank." Or, "The part that customers are," et cetera. Right? So it's, you're signaling that whatever comes after this thing is something that you may want to pay attention to. So it's a great way not only to add structure, but to also grab people's attention back if it has strayed some time as they were either listening to you or reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:42):
Along those lines, I find I find formatting really helpful here, just bold and bullets. I know you have a pet peeve with too much formatting. How much is too much formatting?

Wes Kao (00:29:51):
I really hate excessive formatting. So, I've seen memos where 30% of the note was bolded. And that just negates the entire point of bolding because if everything is bolded then nothing is being highlighted, right? So I think using formatting in general more sparingly than you think you have to is probably a good rule of thumb. I also dislike when people overuse bullets and sentence fragments, phrases in bullets when they should use complete sentences that actually show the connected tissue between ideas, that show the logical flow of what it is that you're saying.

(00:30:33):
And it feels faster and more concise to put bullets and fragments, but a lot of times your reader on the other end of that is needing to decipher and interpret and guess what you actually meant. So it net, net takes longer. And I also think that it can be a little bit of a crutch, it can be a little bit lazy because you are telling yourself that you're being concise when really, if you had to turn your sentence fragment into a full sentence, a lot of times it actually is harder than you think because you realize that you actually didn't really know exactly what you meant. So as you're trying to turn it into a full sentence, you're actually needing to use brainpower.

(00:31:15):
So that's I think a great litmus test of, "Was that idea fully thought out?" Because if it was, you should be able to really quickly turn it into a complete sentence. And many times, you actually aren't. So I see people like basically think, "Oh, I want to make this easier to read, more skimmable. I'm just going to throw a bunch of formatting and bullets and turn everything into bullets." And it's not quite that easy of a solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:41):
This is very much along the lines of the whole Amazon six-page memo where Jeff Bezos just realized, "If you can't write it out as a long memo and explain yourself in prose, you don't actually know what you're saying." And it's a really good filter for helping people actually crystallize and know themselves, "Okay, I see. I don't actually know what I'm doing here." And I love this is a microcosm of that. Can you just make a bullet point a real sentence versus a fragment of a sentence?

(00:32:06):
I'm thinking about as a listener being like, "Okay, how do I actually get better at this?" So maybe let's take a tangent. I know that you teach a whole course, you do all this stuff hands-on with people to help them actually build these skills. For someone that hasn't taken the course or isn't taking it, what's a good way to start practicing these skills and know if what you're writing is getting better, is good. Is it find a mentor, find someone that you think is a great writer and have them review stuff? Any tips there?

Wes Kao (00:32:34):
Yeah. So I have a pretty first principles driven approach for this, which is to think about how long does it take me right now to get to the reaction I'm looking for from my recipient? If it takes a bunch of back and forth and a bunch of friction, then that's my baseline. And once you start practicing some of these communication skills, how does that speed up? If you would have had seven different touch points of back and forth, does that shrink to two to three?

(00:33:08):
Not every point of friction is going to be avoidable, but a lot of it is if you get better at communicating. So I like watching for the reaction and how quickly and how enthusiastically I'm able to get that reaction. And for the things that are working, do more of that. For things that are not working, adjust your execution because it might not be that the tactic doesn't work, it might be your execution of it wasn't great. And keep trying, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:35):
So the advice here is just see how well you're writing/meeting/suggestion goes, how well it does. And if it's not like there's the ideal immediately, "Yes, let's do it." And then there's the, "I don't really understand." There's the spectrum of response. And what I'm hearing is just pay attention to if the speed to getting what you want is increasing in general.

Wes Kao (00:33:59):
Yeah, yeah. I don't think that there's any single shortcut on how to get better besides that. I do think that being fascinated by a topic and being excited about it makes it more likely that you're going to find it fun to try all these different things and try different ways to get through to people. So, I would approach it with a hypothesis-driven experimental mindset and almost like a game. Like, "When I do this, how does that other person react? If I frame it this way, do I get a different reaction? When I try this, am I able to cut through the noise more?"

(00:34:39):
Yeah. So I really think it's about practicing. And I will say that the way not to do it is to try to incorporate 30 different tactics at the same time and then beat yourself up when you don't remember to do them. It's really easy when you are learning a new field or function to get overwhelmed when you're learning a new skill. And the way to build a habit is usually not changing so many different things at once. It's picking one thing that you want to try and keeping that top of mind, trying it in a bunch of different settings in different ways. And getting it better at that thing before moving on to the next thing.

(00:35:19):
So that's like a really common thing I see in my course is people feeling overwhelmed. And I always remind folks that, "You are building a new habit here. And be patient with yourself, take it step by step."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:31):
There's a lot of stuff we're talking about here that a lot of people might be like, "This is so minor. What? I just bullet point sentences, be a little... Tell them the why at the beginning."

(00:35:41):
And I just want to share in my experience the biggest jump I made in my career was actually getting better at these very specific skills. I had this manager, Vlad, who's been on the podcast and I talk about him regularly, who was such a stickler about communicating well and being very clear and concise and thinking and just spending more time on documents and emails, on strategy docs. Just like, "No, this isn't ready. Spend more time, here's something that's not clear." And just doing that was such an accelerant for me.

(00:36:12):
And it's all these little things. That's what's interesting about it. It's like everything seems really minor but it all adds up to a lot of impact because to your point, people see it, "Okay, cool, I get it, let's go." Versus like, "I don't like this idea." And then it's like it all falls apart. So I guess any reactions to that?

Wes Kao (00:36:29):
Yeah. All these little things compound and make a big difference. I often hear people think, "Well, this individual instance, this individual email, the Slack message is not worth spending a couple more minutes on. It's just an email or it's just a Slack message." The problem with that line of thinking is that no one instance of something is ever going to feel important enough to spend a little bit more time on that. And then, but when you zoom out, that's like, "Well that's all your work then. This is literally everything you've touched. This is all your work output then." because any piece of that process you thought wasn't worth spending time on and now this is just the quality of your work and it's not as good as it could be.

(00:37:15):
So yes, these might seem minor but A, it compounds. And also B, all the "big things," everyone else is already doing. So, there's not a lot of alpha in that. Whereas if you are paying attention to skills that people think are boring or too basic and realizing that's a lever that you can pull, that someone else thought, "Oh, we're hitting diminishing returns on that. I'm not going to spend more time on that." But you realize that there's actually more juice left to squeeze there and you decide to squeeze that juice. Well, now, you have extra juice that the other person doesn't have.

(00:37:56):
So yeah, in my experience I find that people claim the point of diminishing returns way too early. And this isn't just for communication, this is for strategies, tactics, et cetera. They'll try something once, a mediocre attempt and be like, "This channel doesn't work. This tactic doesn't work." It's like, "Really? Because it's working for a lot of other people who are getting really creative with it."

(00:38:19):
I'm not saying that everything has to work for you but for you to claim, "This thing just doesn't work," feels a little bit intellectually dishonest. It's more likely that your skill level, your creativity, your execution ability was not good enough. And that's fine. Let's admit that to ourselves because if we admit that, then we can do the hard work of getting better at those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
It feels like if you really boil this down, all the advice comes down to just spend a little more time on all these things you're putting out.

Wes Kao (00:38:51):
I like thinking about it as a little bit more upfront investment. And it is an investment. It's not just time. It's an investment because yes, it takes a little bit longer to make a Slack message a little bit better, but net, net if you save a bunch of questions and back and forth and people asking you things that you don't think they should be asking, then by investing a little bit of upfront effort, you've prevented all that from happening. So yeah, it is a little bit more time in the moment but reaps a lot of benefits down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):

(00:40:42):
You mentioned Slack. I have a great quote also about you that I didn't read that I'm just going to read right now from someone that worked with you. She said she searched the Slack channel at the company you worked at for old posts from Wes for inspiration for what to ask you. And she said you had zero half-baked thoughts, 100% complete sentences, perfect punctuation, clear takeaways at the top of every message. It's the kind of thing you don't notice in isolation, but once you see everyone else's messages in a remote-first company, it's a stark contrast.

Wes Kao (00:41:14):
Yeah, thank you. I will also say that as someone who tries to walk the talk, I feel like I get a pretty good response rate pretty quickly for the things that I ask for, for the recommendations I'm making. It's not instant, it's not 100%, but over time I've realized that improving my communication has led to people receiving my ideas better. Ideas that used to be locked in my head that I would get frustrated that no one else understood. People were now understanding and that feels really good. That's very, very exciting and it made me want to do it more and pay more attention to that. So that's going back to what I said earlier about watching for what's working. There's momentum is really encouraging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):
And I totally feel that. If you start getting the things you want, that feels great. I'd be like, "Okay, cool."

Wes Kao (00:42:08):
Yeah, more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
"Let's do more of that." Yeah, and again, it's like very minor things. It's like a couple more minutes on the Slack message, a couple more minutes on email.

Wes Kao (00:42:16):
Very doable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):
Yeah, which everyone can do. There's no magic here, it's just spend a little more time and use some of these tactics that we're talking about. Speaking of that, let me talk about another tactic. Apparently you have some really good advice on finding the right level of confidence in what you're saying. There's always this question of, "I come to this leader. How confident should I be about, 'This is the answer,' versus, 'Here's a bunch of ideas'?" What do you think? What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:42:41):
I find that people tend to naturally be on the spectrum a little bit too confident as a baseline or not confident enough. So people who are too confident might state hypotheses as if they are fact. So that really bothers me. That's another one of my pet peeves, where if you say, "This is X," or, "This will X," that is different than saying, "This could X," or, "This might X," or, "This will increase the likelihood of X."

(00:43:12):
So I'm a big proponent of speaking accurately. You can avoid a lot of problems if you speak accurately about your level of conviction and about the actual amount of evidence that you have for something. It's okay for something to be an initial hunch. Say, "It's an initial hunch." Don't act like this is something that you are super sure about. You've proven out that this is absolutely this way because the rest of your team is listening to you at face value. And y'all might spend real headcount and dollars pursuing something that you have advocated for in a way where you overreached with your level of confidence.

(00:43:52):
So, that's for people who are overconfident. It's equally a problem if you're under-confident. So I have some clients who their CEO asked them to share some recommendations with another team because they've run something before and so they share all this amazing information and at the end they're like, "Oh, but you can ignore everything I just said. Obviously, make your own decision. Do what you think is best. And if you want to just ignore everything, that's totally cool too." And it's like you just didn't have to say that. You could say, "Make your own decision, take all this into account," but you don't have to diminish to that degree.

(00:44:31):
And so again, speaking accurately, if you have really strong reasons to recommend something to the cross-functional team, it's almost irresponsible to act like you are not really sure and it's just this random idea, "Hey, try it if you want to." We might lose a lot of money and time if we don't take this idea, right? So again, speaking accurately is so, so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
Is a simple way to think about then the right balance is have a point of view, have a recommendation, present accurate facts, and be clear when you are not? "It's not actually 100% true, but here's a hunch I have, or here's a theory we have."

Wes Kao (00:45:11):
Yeah, I think sharing a point of view, sharing a recommendation, and then backing it up with evidence, with logic, with first principles, with examples, with data, if you have it. Not every situation you're going to have data for, especially if you're building something new. So this is where first principles comes in. Even explaining how you got to where you got to and why you think this is going to work, that all gives your team, your manager, something to push back on, to poke holes on or to align on and say, "Yeah, I agree here, but I disagree on this part."

(00:45:44):
So you can talk about ideas with a lot more specificity when you share your thought process. And you can frame it all kicking off saying, "My initial thinking is," or, "Based on what we know, my hunch is, blank." So speaking accurately and then still bringing up those facts so that we can all make as informed of a decision as we can make given what we know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Advice I got that really helped here for me was to try not to be biased with how you frame everything. You have your suggestion for how to do something. It's easy to just bias all of the data to point in that direction. And if people notice that, they're like, "Oh, okay. Well, I can't really trust this because I see you're just like, you clearly have an agenda." So it's a little bit like having an agenda and a POV, but be clear about what is actually true. Be accurate.

Wes Kao (00:46:36):
Yeah. I think anytime people have to discount what you're saying because you are biased in this way is not great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:45):
Is there an example by any chance that highlights what you're describing here?

Wes Kao (00:46:49):
Yeah, so in my course I talk about not being a single-minded martyr. So single-minded martyr is someone who very much has an agenda, who wants the recommendation to go through and is presenting a bunch of evidence, supporting that direction. And then gets really frustrated when other people are not seeing it or are skeptical. And so one of my clients was a single-minded martyr in a recommendation she was making. So she was on the growth acquisition side of her company. And was having trouble with cross-functional team members lending headcount to her project. And so everyone would say like, " Oh, yes, we believe in this, this is important," but wouldn't want to actually give her half of their engineer for two weeks.

(00:47:36):
And we were talking about it and as we were talking, she revealed that the CEO had at the beginning of the year said that the company-wide goal is retention that year. That their biggest challenges and areas of opportunity were in retention, not necessarily in growth. And once she zoomed out and realized this, she was able to put her recommendation in context. And realized that it's not just-

Wes Kao (00:48:00):
... recommendation in context. And realize that it's not just I'm the only one who cares about this company. Everyone is a hypocrite. They say they believe this, but don't actually want to work on it. Before that was kind of her narrative, but once she zoomed out and realized she was being a single [inaudible 00:48:16], she could better fit her proposal in the context of what else was happening in the organization. I think actually this is a really big difference between more junior people versus more senior people. More junior people are like, "I need to win. I need to get a yes for this proposal and I'm going to keep advocating for it until I get a yes." Whereas really sometimes the best decision for the company is not right now. This doesn't actually fit our priorities right now, right?

(00:48:42):
Or maybe yes, but let's right size the level of investment. So it might look like half whatever the size of what that recommendation actually was, and having the maturity to realize that, to put your idea into context is huge. That took me a really long time to learn and I think that goes under the umbrella of always do what's best for the company, not necessarily what's best for me, my career, my team, my wins. If you prioritize what's best for the company, that helps you have a more right-sized way of still advocating for your ideas, but doing it with a bit more equanimity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
And also just connecting to what the company is. Just this idea of if the thing you're pitching is not aligned with what is important to the company right now, it's unlikely to be prioritized. It makes sense. This is why leaders choose, here's what matters most. We got to do the things that are going to help us drive this thing right now, like retention or revenue. And so that's just, I think, a sub tactic there is just whenever you're pitching something, connect that to the goal of the person you're pitching to so that they're like, "Oh, I see how this is going to help me. That's great. Let's do it. Great advice."

(00:50:01):
And I think this is something a lot of people run into. It's just, "Why aren't they listening to me? Why don't they want... That's such a good idea. They hate me." It's something, "Oh, I bet they hate me. They don't trust me." When it's just like, okay, this isn't a priority right now. Let's come back to it another time. Okay. I'm going to get to a couple more tactics and then I'm going to shift directions to talk about managers and being manager. You have an awesome framework called MOO. What is MOO? What does it stand for and what is it all about?

Wes Kao (00:50:26):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. M-O-O. And the thought there is that a lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get, especially in meetings where we feel blindsided, that was unexpected, and then we're on our back foot. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get when I share this, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. So are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely. And so this is where knowing your own argument in and out, including counterarguments becomes so important. So knowing your counterarguments as well as you know the arguments for doing the thing. When you do that, when you have prepared in that way, you're less likely to feel caught off guard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
When you hear you talk about this, it's like, obviously I shouldn't do this, but very few people actually do this, actually spend a couple minutes, " Okay, here's what I'm going to pitch."

Wes Kao (00:51:31):
Even a couple seconds, really. Really, even a couple seconds, your brain will think of something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:38):
Is there a story or an example of this that you share that highlights this idea of the power of MOO?

Wes Kao (00:51:43):
I use MOO multiple times a day, every day, every single day. Literally whatever I'm about to say I think how might someone disagree with this or what might an objection be? So whatever it is I'm writing, saying, it's a really good mental filter because it encourages you to think a couple steps ahead in kind of a structured way, right? If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me. Well, if I take that into account, I can volunteer that information upfront or I can frame it in a way where they're less likely to think that that's an issue.

(00:52:19):
And so it's muscle memory for me at this point, and this might be something we include at the end is something to start with. But putting MOO on a post-it, Most Obvious Objection, what is someone likely to object about? And then just keeping that top of mind. It's a great way to train yourself to empathize with your audience and with your recipient. We all say that and we all know we should do it, but for me this is a really tactical concrete way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:50):
I think what's great about a lot of the tactics you're sharing is not only is it going to help you communicate it better, but it helps you actually think and crystallize it better for yourself because you may realize, oh, that's a really good objection. Like, oh, the objection's probably going to be this. Will it drive enough impact for the business? Oh, that's a great point. Maybe I should not pitch this right now.

Wes Kao (00:53:10):
Yeah. It definitely helps shape your own thinking. I think communication and thinking are so much more interrelated than we think. I think people think there's a thinking as phase one and then communicating the thinking, and the reality is a lot more intertwined. And I loved your example there that thinking ahead to what might be the most obvious objection actually then prompts you to realize that maybe there was a gap in what you were planning to present and then you now have an opportunity to strengthen that pitch before you say it out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
There's a quote I have highlighted on this podcast a number of times that I love that is exactly along these lines by Joan Didion. "I don't know what I think until I write it down." I know exactly that feeling. Okay. So there's a couple more things that people have shared that you are amazing at helping them get better at. One is just keeping your cool and staying calm during very high stakes, real-time conversations when things maybe aren't going your way or if you disagree with someone, any advice on that, it feels like you're really good at this.

Wes Kao (00:54:17):
I think one thing that tends to throw people off is putting a lot of pressure on themselves to get the exact right answer. So if they are asked a question and they don't know the answer, a lot of people will then kind of freak out. And I was taught early in my career that if you don't know the answer, you should say, "Let me look into it, I'll get back to you." So that's a fine approach. It's definitely better than making something up, right? So definitely don't make something up. But if you are more experienced and have some confidence in your subject matter area, just saying I'll get back to you, is sometimes a missed opportunity. You can ask for a bit more information to be able to continue the conversation in that moment. So let's say that your exec says what percentage of users came from mobile last month and you don't have that number off the top of your head.

(00:55:20):
So person A says, "Let me look into it and I'll get back to you." Person B might say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter the number has been 60 to 70% and it's grown in the past year, so mobile is now a bigger part of our business, et cetera. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately or where's that commission coming from, basically? Right? And so being able to answer a similar question in the direction you think the person is asking about and then validating why they're asking that question allows you to still continue that conversation in the moment. I call it the question behind the question, sometimes you get a question, but underneath there's a deeper underlying concern.

(00:56:10):
And many times people don't even know that it's there, right? Subconscious. So it's not nefarious, they're not withholding anything from you. But when you are explaining something and you're kind of getting multiple questions on the same thing, it's a good sign that there might be a deeper question behind the question and it's our responsibility to figure out what might that be. And so probing, asking for a bit more information, answering in that general direction and then validating these are all techniques you can use when you are in the moment without feeling like, oh, I must have every single thing prepared and the moment that I'm caught off guard, everything goes to shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
Another tactic along these lines that's very similar to what you're describing, but I'll share that I learned that was really helpful is just if you're not sure what to say, basically just reflecting back their question and just being like, let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for. You want to understand monthly retention for, and then maybe clarify. And that one gives you time to think about it as you're talking. Two, it helps the person recognize, "Oh, he hears me. Great. Okay, this is good. He's thinking about this." And then at the end of that you could be like, "Okay. I don't actually have that specific number. Let me think about it." Or, "I have the quarterly number. Okay. That's what I know." So there's an interim step almost that I'll add into your piece of advice of just reflect back their question, just better understand what they're looking for.

Wes Kao (00:57:32):
Yeah, I love that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:34):
Awesome. Okay, let's go back to what I said we do. Let's pick one tactic that you think people should try first, maybe one or two. So let me read the ones we've gone through and then see what you think would be a good first step. So one is starting with sales, before getting to logistics and giving people the why signposting using specific words to help people guide the doc and not get overwhelmed. Finding the right level of confidence, having a POV, that sort of thing. Getting better, being concise, MOO, not overusing formatting, something else you shared. And then this idea of when you don't know the answer, not saying I'll get back to you as the default, maybe giving them a different answer, maybe asking them more questions. Across those, which do you think someone should try to like, "Okay. Let me start here."

Wes Kao (00:58:25):
I would start with Most Obvious Objection and also framing your conversation up front. And that kind of relates to using signposting words if needed to help you frame that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:37):
Sweet. That's such an easy one to remember. Just MOO. Okay. So stick a post it somewhere when you're about to share something in Slack and ask someone for something, present in a meeting, send a strategy, and just think about for a few seconds what might be the most obvious objection to what I'm trying to ask them to do. Great. Okay. So let's talk about management. And there's kind of two sides to it. Being a manager and being a person reporting to a manager, you have a bunch of really good advice here. One is there around managing up. One of my most popular posts in the early days was advice for managing up and just how important it is. What advice do you have for someone to get better at managing up? Why is that even so important? Why do you think people may be under appreciating how important it is to manage your manager, let's say.

Wes Kao (00:59:18):
One of the most common myths about managing up that I definitely felt early on in my career was that I would have to manage up if I were more junior, but eventually I would outgrow it, that I would get senior enough that I would no longer have to do it. And it was a rude awakening that no matter how senior I got, managing up, I not only had to manage up, it actually became more important. So I think managing up is one of those skills that if you invest in learning it, it serves you now and for the rest of your career. And I realize that many senior people are actually the best at managing up. That's partially how they got to be so senior in the first place. But also, the more senior you get, the less likely that your manager is going to give you really well-defined tasks and problems on a silver platter and ask you to solve them.

(01:00:09):
You are going to be dealing with more ambiguity and you're going to be dealing with sometimes a mandate like make this number go up or create this division, right? Where you need to manage up and make sure that your leader, your manager, is in the loop about what you are about to try and what you're about to do and make sure that they're aligned. And so for me, realizing that managing up is something that is ongoing and that it shifts and evolves and looks different as you go in your career, that was a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
Just that even if you become even a VP, if you become a director and still something you want to invest in, any specific tactic or advice for how to manage up well.

Wes Kao (01:00:54):
The biggest one is to share your point of view. So this some people are surprised by because they think I'm going to say do a weekly recap of the tasks that you worked on or what you contributed. And that is a good idea, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I think the more highly leveraged way to contribute and manage up is by being more vocal about sharing your point of view. When you just ask your manager, "Hey manager, what should we do?" You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" You give them something to build off of and that reduces the amount of mental lift that they have to put forth.

(01:01:54):
And so sharing your point of view more readily, backing it up with evidence, that's a wonderful way of making your manager's life easier. And also showing that you are an active rigorous thinker who is thinking strategically about the business. You're not just waiting to be told what to do, you're not expecting them to figure things out and then tell you you are actively looking around the corner trying to solve problems, forming hypotheses in your mind, observing and noticing things. And again, sharing your point of view doesn't mean that you have the perfect answer. You can share that, "Hey, I've noticed this problem popping up in a couple of different places. Here's what I think might be happening."

(01:02:36):
Or when you share a report, don't only share the report and expect your manager to come up with insights and takeaways. You should look at the report too and point out insights and takeaways. So it's really changing that posture from more reactive and more waiting to be told what to do or kind of staying in this narrow box to being willing to share your recommendation, your point of view, share what you're noticing, and this is something that even junior people could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:04):
I was going to say exactly that. I think not only is it something junior people can do, this is a really good way to get promoted and to take on more leadership opportunities. You coming to your manager with, "Here's something I think we should do. Here's a perspective I have. Here's an opportunity." If you were in charge, you're like, how awesome would it be for people to come to me with amazing ideas and have clear recommendations? That sounds great. Everyone wants that. So if you can do that, amazing. Who wouldn't want that? But then what's interesting is similar to how writing helps you crystallize your thinking, you coming in with a recommendation forces you to really think deeply about it because that's putting your reputation on the line. So there's a second order effect of it makes you actually spend more time on the thing and be clear about why you think this is a good idea and do more research. So a lot of wins here.

Wes Kao (01:03:53):
There are a lot of situations where you might have the most visibility into a problem. You might have the most proximity into an issue. And so if you're not speaking up about it and sharing what you're observing, sharing what you're noticing, your manager doesn't necessarily have visibility into that. And so I've heard so many managers say that they want their junior people to speak up more because their junior people have often close contact with customers, with support tickets, with cleaning data, with a bunch of things where the manager would love to hear insights from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
If you're not having success with this, if you're hearing this and be like, but it never worked, my manager doesn't listen to me, listen to the rest of this podcast we just did, which is basically advice on how to effectively convince someone of a thing. It's like, tell them why this is a problem, be really concise about it, sign post words, all these things. That's exactly what this whole conversation's been about. Okay. Let's see. We have a couple more really cool tactics that people have suggested we talk about. One is how to give feedback well, how to do better, how to be more effective at giving feedback. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (01:05:05):
I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression. And so the idea here is that most of the time, by the time we are giving feedback to someone, we have been frustrated for a while. I used to be very conflict diverse, so I would wait and try to convince myself that I wasn't bothered by something until I really couldn't hold it in anymore. Then I would schedule a one-on-one with a coworker to tell them the feedback and it would inevitably turn into a venting session where I was in the name of sharing the impact of what they did would share all my frustrations and all the ways that they have basically harmed me and made my life difficult. And this would be very counterproductive because the person would either feel like and feel really demoralized or they'd get really defensive and they'd want to argue with me about how what they did actually was not that bad or it was partially my fault too or whatever.

(01:05:59):
And so I realized that a better way of giving feedback is thinking about motivating the person's behavior change. The goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change, help them understand the benefit to them as well as to the people around them. And so usually for me, that's trimming 90% of the initial stuff that I want to say and really keeping only that 10%. And that's made a really big difference. Whenever I am giving constructive feedback of any kind, I always keep that in mind. And when I don't do it, I almost always regret it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Someone close to me in my life is working on the skill, which is there's just, "I want people to know how they messed up. Justice. I need this to be fair." And what I always recommend is just think about what you want to get out of this conversation, what do you want from them? And then, okay, what's the best way to get that? Versus just making sure they hear you and making sure they understand how screwed up this was. And that's basically what you're saying is focus on the outcome you want to achieve, not something that's useful, something that will make you just feel better.

Wes Kao (01:07:23):
Yeah. I definitely think that having a space to vent and to share those frustrations is important. So you want to get that out before you go into the conversation with your counterpart. So whether it's talking to your therapist or your partner or friend, you want to basically get all that energy out because otherwise you bring it into the conversation and it doesn't take much to set you off. You might have a whole script, you're controlled, you're calm, and then you start talking and the other person raises an eyebrow and is acting a little incredulous at what you're saying, and that's all it takes for you to snap and be like, "You're surprised? You're incredulous? Why are you incredulous?" Right? And then you're off, right? Yeah. Getting that energy out, I would say step one, so that you can go into the conversation clear, grounded, setting that emotional tone that is more positive and that allows you to stay focused on only the part that will get them to behave in the way you want them to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Such good advice. And I think we come back to are you getting the outcomes you want? If you're not, this is another reason it might be the case is you just need them to hear your mind. I just need you to know. And I think a lesson here is that may not be the best path to getting what you want, but it may feel good. Maybe people are like, "Ah, but I really want them to know this."

Wes Kao (01:08:42):
There's that great Einstein quote about insanity being repeating things that you're doing expecting a different outcome. And I feel like that applies so much to the workplace and to communication. Most of us have certain patterns that we are used to and certain ways of responding, and if you believe that there is untapped upside that whatever you are at is kind of a local maximum and that there's better out there, then that's where switching things up could be useful and not just doing everything that you've been doing and getting the same result that you might be getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
This resonates with Toby Lutke when he is doing the podcast, talked about how... He had this quote that I love that just "No human in history has come anywhere near their potential and everyone is way, way, way better than they think are," and these are really cool tactics and really effective ways to actually get closer to your potential. Okay. Two more things I want to talk about real quick. One is your advice on delegating, but also continuing to have high standards. This is something I spent a lot of time on because a lot of people don't delegate because they're afraid it's not going to be as great. I just want this to be really good. I don't trust that it's going to go as well. If I did it my way, it'd be great. So just advice on how to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards.

Wes Kao (01:10:04):
Yeah. I have a framework called CEDAF. C-E-D-A-F.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:08):
Mm-hmm. I love all these acronyms.

Wes Kao (01:10:09):
It's kind of like Cedar, but with an F at the end. I need acronyms for myself. All of these are really reminders for myself because I need a short way to remind myself. So CEDAF stands for the C is comprehension. So have I given this person that I'm delegating to everything that they need to understand what it is that I want them to do. That includes more simple things like logins to all the right software tools that they need to look up, whatever you need to look up. And understanding what the end result should look like, right? So that's all under C for comprehension. E is excitement. Am I explaining this in a way that is making this as exciting as it could be? There are a lot of tasks that aren't inherently that exciting, but by explaining the why behind we're doing this or why it's important to the project we're working on, that makes people more likely to understand and be excited about how this fits into everything.

(01:11:06):
So E is for excitement. D is for de-risk. Am I de-risking any obvious risks from delegating this? So usually when I ask clients this, they immediately think of something. They're like, "Oh yeah, I wouldn't want my direct report to spend a ton of time going in the wrong direction, filling out a hundred rows of the spreadsheet if actually it took longer than we expected." Okay, great. If that's a risk, then maybe you have them do 10 rows, see how long it takes, see if we need all the information that they're actually gathering, and then regroup, right? So what's an obvious risk? Another might be I can see this person misunderstanding and thinking I'm looking for this where I'm really looking for that. Okay, perfect. Just tell them, "When I explain this, you might think I mean this, but really I don't want that. I actually want this," right? So just vocalize it. The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to-

Wes Kao (01:12:00):
The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to speak up and make sure we are actually aligned, that they're picking up what I'm putting down? Because you might be explaining a bunch of stuff, but how much are they actually absorbing? You won't ever know if you wrap up your little spiel and then say, "Okay, go off. Come back to me when you're done." So give people a chance to ask questions to see what parts are resonating, what parts they might be a little bit confused on. Usually, when I do this, it's amazing. Because my team member will say, "What did you mean by this part? How does this part fit in?" I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot to mention this thing." Or, "Oh yeah, I didn't even really explain that well." Okay, so let's go into that.

(01:12:42):
And then F is feedback. How can you have the shortest feedback loop possible? I am a huge fan of shorting the feedback loop as much as possible and then shortening it again. So even within that initial conversation where I'm delegating something, instead of waiting a week, what if we waited a day and checked in on the initial direction that person was going? And let's do it even more. What if after I finished explaining, at the end of that conversation, we brainstormed a couple things that, that person wants to do? So within this same conversation, I'm delegating, I'm already getting a sense of, where do you want to go with this? Once you start, do you see any bottlenecks?

(01:13:24):
And so just really keeping that feedback loop super tight. I found that when I run through the CDAP acronym, there's usually one letter that I could amp up a little bit more like, oh, I didn't really put much thought into making this exciting for the person. How can I connect this to their career goals or to the company's priorities this quarter or to something else? So it's a nice mental checklist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
So much of your advice comes back to this idea that we've touched on a couple of times. We just spend a little bit more time upfront. Is that how you described it, a little more time upfront?

Wes Kao (01:13:56):
Yeah, a little bit more time. A little bit more of an investment upfront.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
Upfront to save you tons of time later. Okay. So as you described this, I don't know if you're realizing this, but you're basically just helping people work better with AI and agents. This framework is exactly I think what people need to effectively delegate to this future world of this agent world of society of agents doing work for us. Basically, you're going to be delegating to these agents in the future, and this framework is a really cool way to frame it. So think about it. Am I communicating this well, comprehension? So CDAP. Comprehension is, again, can I make this clear? Is that the way to think about that?

Wes Kao (01:14:41):
Yeah. Can I make this clear? Does this person have everything they need to be able to accomplish what I am asking them to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):
Okay. And then it's communicate why you're excited about this, basically the why. And it's interesting, there's this funny prompt technique I've learned, prompting engineering technique of just telling the AI, "This is very important to my job." Just using that sentence, it does it better.

Wes Kao (01:14:47):
Oh, interesting, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:04):
It takes it more seriously. It's just so weird. I have a post about this, and that's one of the pieces of advice, just tell me why this is important. I think people take it to the extreme as someone will die if you don't get this right. That actually works.

Wes Kao (01:15:16):
That is extreme. Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
It's wild. Okay, so CEDF, comprehension, excited, de-risk, think about ways you can de-risk, which is moot, basically. What's the most? It's a similar concept. Just think ahead to what might go wrong. Make sure you're aligned, which is quite important in the AI space. Make sure you're aligned. And feedback, get a quick feedback cycle. And it's interesting with deep research on some of these AI tools now, it's like, "I'm off for half an hour. See you." And I imagine more and more of them will check in with you as it's going and ask you questions. I used deep research recently and it's really good at just like, okay, let me have five questions for you before I go off and do this work just to clarify what you want.

Wes Kao (01:15:58):
Yeah, I found that AI will often shorten the feedback loop and align with you as well. When you prompt it, when it comes back, it will not do the entire task for me, sometimes. It'll say, "I've done the first part of this. Does this sound right? Is this what you're looking for? If so, I will complete the next section." And then sometimes I'm like, "Do the whole thing. Just stop trying to conserve energy and just do. I want you to do the whole thing." But that's what it's doing, it's breaking it into smaller chunks to de-risk that it's going to use all this bandwidth to process this thing and I'm going to say, "Oh, that's not what I was looking for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
I'm going to come back to AI real quick, but before I do that, I have one more question for you, but let me just say, I feel like we've discovered an AI version of your course now. Basically, how to delegate well to AI agents that I think people are going to find really valuable, planting a seed. Okay. Before we get back to AI, you have this other concept that I love that I actually learned from you years ago when I was working on my course called the swipe file. Swipe file, what is a swipe file? What is that about? What can it help you with? Why should people be doing this?

Wes Kao (01:17:03):
Yeah. So swipe files are really common for marketers, and I think other functions haven't caught on as much, but I think it is really, really useful. And basically a swipe file is collecting inspiration that you can refer back to later on. So some marketers will collect examples of copy, landing pages, ads, et cetera. For me, I have a file, an Apple Notes, file called Smart Things People Have Said, where I will basically paste in phrases, words, things people have said that I thought were well articulated or sounded really intelligent or sounded strategic. And I don't actually go back and look through my swipe file very often, I think other people do, but for me, even the act of adding it to my swipe file, I've already gotten value from it because it's training me to be more alert to noticing when something is working well.

(01:18:01):
I think there's so much happening around us all the time that your coworker says something smart and you're like, "Oh, that was nice," and then you keep moving on. But when you stop and pause and think, oh, that was really effective, let me add it to my file, and also think about, why was that effective and is that something I can borrow? So in my course, I encourage folks to create a work journal where they can jot down some of these observations, some of these phrases, and basically encourage yourself to be more alert to things you can borrow from other people all around you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Something else about the swipe file, you use quotes. It could be screenshots of cool designs. It could be strategy docs you found to be really effective. It could be conversion flows that are really cool. It could be just whatever you're interested in.

Wes Kao (01:18:52):
Yeah. And the great thing about that is you can then go back and analyze it and break down the structure, break down the argument, break down why was this so effective? Whereas if you're not capturing it, it's easy to just move on to the next thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Yeah, cool. And I did this for a while. I stopped, to be honest, but I really want to be doing this. So this is maybe some homework or something, because I know a lot of people stick with it, is just start like a folder or a Notes, note, whatever you use for your note-taking, and just start throwing stuff in there. And it could be messy, right? It's just like, throw it in.

Wes Kao (01:19:27):
It can be super messy. I was going to say, my back end system is super messy and it's fine. It's not a problem I need to be solving. It works. I find things I need to find. So I like having as simple of a process as possible. So Apple Notes, I open it. It's just on my home screen, I just add something. I'm not tagging anything, I'm not putting it in certain rows and filling information out. I'm just including it in a file, and if I want to go back and look at it, it served its purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:58):
Awesome. Okay, so last question. AI, I'm going to just come back to this briefly. We have this segment on the podcast called AI Corner, and we touched on this already, but I'm just curious how you have found AI to be useful in your work or your life, whether it's helped you become a better communicator? Is there anything you can share that might be helpful to folks?

Wes Kao (01:20:18):
Yeah. I love Claude. There are days when I talk to Claude for three or four hours prompting as a thought partner. So yeah, I think that AI is really helpful for an initial draft of something to bounce off of. Sometimes I'll paste in an email that I am not quite sure how to respond to and ask Claude, "Tell me draft reply." And I'll usually give it some direction. So I found that sharing my point of view makes the output way better. If I just give it something and say, "What would you say?" It's just not as good. Whereas if I say, "I am not sure about how to tell this person no, because I previously said yes and so I feel on the hook, but history has changed and so is there a nice way where I can be really respectful of our relationship and also make them feel seen and heard, but decline?"

(01:21:19):
So if I explain, "That's the problem I'm dealing with and here's what I would ideally like to be able to do," Claude comes back to something that's pretty good. And then from there I'll edit it to my voice because usually it's a little bit too formal sounding. And so I'll make some edits and then I'll share it back to Claude and say, "What do you think of this version? Would you make any improvements?" And then we go back and forth from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:41):
Wes, this is the most useful thing I've ever heard.

Wes Kao (01:21:44):
[inaudible 01:21:44].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:45):
I need this and I need this immediately, just nice ways to say no to stuff. This needs to be an extension that I can have in my browser, just, "Help me say no to this, please." Wow, such a great idea. Okay, good one. Okay, great. Wes, is there anything else? We've gone through a lot. I imagine the answer is no, but before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Wes Kao (01:22:11):
No, I feel like we covered a bunch of great frameworks, principles, so lots for folks to get started.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
All the things. And I love that so much of this will apply to being more effective with AI tools and I feel like people can go through this again and just through that lens of, how will this helped me get more out of Claude and ChatGPT? I bet so much of this will actually apply and I feel like there's an interesting course there. With that, Wes, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Wes Kao (01:22:39):
All right,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Are you ready?

Wes Kao (01:22:41):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Okay. First question, what are a couple books that you recommend most to other people?

Wes Kao (01:22:46):
One is High Output Management by Andy Grove, which is a classic. Another one is Your Brain At Work by Dr. David Rock. And that one is all about better understanding your own brain and attention span so that you can allocate your mental resources appropriately. So that one's great. Ever since reading that, I hide my phone from view because there have been studies that show that even seeing your phone in the corner of your eye, it's distracting. And I do the hardest things earlier in the day when you have more cognitive resources available. So that one's really good. Yeah, those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
These are great. I completely get that phone thing. I'm just looking at my phone, I'm like, "Dang, get out of here. Just go away."

Wes Kao (01:23:36):
I will stick it under my pillow on the couch or hide it under a notebook. It's huge. I'm always hiding my phone so it's not in my line of sight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:47):
I think Arianna Huffington has a product you can buy that's a little bed for your phone that you put to bed before you go to bed in a different room and it has a charger attached.

Wes Kao (01:23:54):
Oh, that's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:55):
So cute, so cute.

Wes Kao (01:23:57):
I don't know if I need a separate bed for my phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:01):
But it's like a ritual, I guess, and there's some theory behind it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Wes Kao (01:24:08):
I love Anything by Harlan Coben on Netflix. Basically, I don't even remember any specific movies or a TV series, but anything he puts out, he's an author and then they've turned a lot of his books into mystery thriller TV series, and anything he puts out becomes number one on Netflix. And I appreciate that he gives the people what they want, that he knows his craft, he knows his genre. And yeah, he just has so many bangers. And I don't remember any specific one, but if it's a Harlan Coben show, I know it's going to be good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:46):
I'm looking at a list now I just Googled real quick. So it's all scary stuff, right?

Wes Kao (01:24:49):
Yeah, they're mystery thrillers, and I think he does a good job playing with time and revealing information over time. It's usually something about someone's past that is now coming to haunt them, and so he'll skip between present day to the past and then slowly reveal stuff. And there's always a twist at the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:11):
There's a page, the Harlan Coben Collection on Netflix. That we'll link to that has all this stuff. I've never heard of this, so this is great. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Wes Kao (01:25:22):
I recently started using an electric toothbrush and it's been life-changing. So my husband got one and then a couple weeks later he gifted me one, and I was like, "Wow, this is actually really nice."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:34):
Are you a Sonicare person, Oral-B person, or something else?

Wes Kao (01:25:37):
It's Oral-B but I've not tried any other brand. That was one that our dentist gifted my husband this electric toothbrush because he did Invisalign. And I'm sure Invisalign is every dentist's dream.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:51):
Margins.

Wes Kao (01:25:52):
I feel like every time I get a cleaning, the dentist is like, "So have you thought about, are you interested in Invisalign?" I'm like, "No." And so when they get a yes, I'm sure they're really excited, and then they lock you in, the brand locks you in with these replacement toothbrush heads that are way more expensive than they should be. So it's a whole razor and blades, ink cartridge and printer model here. So I was horrified by how expensive these replacement heads were.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:18):
But you got a free toothbrush. I think the Oral-B is what I use, but I think that's what the Wirecutter recommended, but it's so loud. I don't know. One of them is just really loud. I think it's the Oral-B, but it's better, apparently. I went with Wirecutter, but it's so loud. I feel like there needs to be a Wirecutter for good design and experience...

Wes Kao (01:26:37):
Ooh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:37):
... versus just the optimal efficient version. Anyway, let's keep going. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you repeat yourself and share with folks?

Wes Kao (01:26:51):
Yes. I actually have many, but I'll share two. One is everything takes longer than you think. So this applies whether you are calling customer support for something or running an errand or building your career, building skills. I find it's useful to add buffers for yourself. This applies for launches too. Just assume it will take longer than you think and you'll be less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That connects to everything we've been talking about. Just spend a little more time upfront to make it. And maybe if you spend more time front, it'll take less time than you think.

Wes Kao (01:27:25):
The other one is a riff on always be closing, like Glengarry Ross. "It's always be selling." This does not mean pawning your wares, but rather putting forth effort into convincing the other person of whatever your recommendation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):
Love them. Okay, final question. So you've been a long time, I hate this word operator, but I guess that's the way people describe this, where you've just been working at companies, building companies, and you recently left that just to become creative person. Started a course on Maven. You do executive coaching, things like that. Any just lessons or a lesson from that jump that might be helpful to folks that are maybe thinking about that?

Wes Kao (01:28:07):
I think when you are an in-house operator, there's a lot about your role that you have a little bit less control over, basically. There's just certain things you have to do because it comes with the territory. Whereas when you are a solo operator running your own business, doing your own thing, you have a lot of freedom to craft your work around only your strengths, only the part that you are really good at, that adds a lot of value for other people where there's market demand. And so, for me, there was a bit of a shift where when I realized that I could craft my business, my work around only the part that I'm best at, and that can be a narrow-ass slice, that's actually really, really freeing.

(01:28:54):
And so I would encourage folks to think about, what is the thing that you are extremely good at that people find super valuable, the part that you love doing most, if you could not do all the other stuff you don't want to do, and how can you think about doubling down on that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:12):
That's such an important point. And the Claude tip you shared of how to say no well is such an important ingredient into that, because so many things come at you and are interesting and enticing that it's hard to decline, that you realize, why the hell am I doing this? I can actually control where I spend time and why did I say yes to this?

Wes Kao (01:29:33):
I actually credit you with helping me come to this realization. I mentioned you on a podcast the other day about this because, do you remember when Maven was launching an important feature, I think it was our marketplace or something, and I had asked you if you wanted to go on Clubhouse to be part of the launch?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
I remember that, but I am sure I said no.

Wes Kao (01:29:59):
Okay, yeah. You said no. You said no. And I was like, "Wow. Out of curiosity, what's the thought behind it?" And you said, I'm going to bastardize this, you could correct me, but you essentially said, "I don't really like doing live public speaking type things and I've been fortunate enough to build a career where I can write, I do my podcasts, and work only on the part that I love doing. And so I'm okay saying no to these other really interesting opportunities." And I remember at that time thinking it was so groundbreaking that you could say no to something that was legitimately a cool opportunity and be really confident about it because it wasn't your core competency. It wasn't the thing you are best at. And I've really kept that in mind when opportunities come my way of, am I excited about this? Is this what I'm really good at? Can I shine in this setting? Because when you are solo, you get to choose the settings that you want to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):
That's such a cool story. I don't exactly remember that, but I am zero surprised at what I said. And the way I put it now, when folks invite me to stuff like this is I just find the ROI on my time is so not worth doing a talk, doing a fireside thing, doing another podcast. It's just like, if I can spend more time on this newsletter than the podcast, the leverage is so much higher than just doing a talk because that takes so much time. So I just have this template now that basically says what I sent you, that is, that it helps. But it's tough. It's so hard to say no. Sometimes these opportunities are so interesting and the person is like, "Wait, what?"

(01:31:37):
Because I don't think the people asking you for stuff know that I'm getting 10 of them a day, and they're like, "Oh, he said no to my talk. He doesn't want to be on my podcast. What a jerk." That's what I think. I don't know if that's what they think. But anyway. Okay, that's great. Yes, and I think I just had a post about reaching a million subscribers to the newsletter, and actually had this image of the Ikigai concept, which is exactly what you just described, which is you want to try to find the thing that you love doing, that people value, and that you can make money doing. That's the dream. And that's exactly what you have done as well. So thank you for being here, Wes. I actually think we delivered on what I thought we would. I think this is going to be one of the most highest leverage conversations we've had.

(01:32:21):
So two final questions. Where can folks find your course? I know you also do executive coaching. Where can folks learn more? And final question is just, how can folks be useful to you, Wes?

Wes Kao (01:32:33):
You can find out more at weskao.com. I linked my course to my coaching from my main page. I also post on LinkedIn as well, so you can follow me there. And I'm always looking to meet fellow operators who out about communication. So if you put any of these principles into practice, I would love to hear about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:53):
Awesome. We'll do that in the comments. They can DM you. I don't know, what's the best way to reach you on the website or Twitter?

Wes Kao (01:32:59):
Yeah, bunch of platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:02):
All the places. Okay, cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:04):
Website, email, LinkedIn, DM me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:05):
There we go. There we go. Wes, thank you so much for being here.

Wes Kao (01:33:08):
Yeah, thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:09):
Very cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:10):

# An inside look at how Figma builds product | Yuhki Yamashita (CPO of Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:15):
This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? A's notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed.

(00:02:40):
And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free.

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:32:36):

(00:32:44):
As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma.

# An inside look at how Figma builds product | Yuhki Yamashita (CPO of Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma. And you can tweet at me, you can find me anywhere. And, of course, we're also hiring, so if you know great people or are interested, yeah, there's a lot of roles, so please get in touch.

Lenny (01:08:06):
Awesome. Yuhki, thank you so much for being here.

# How to grow a subscription business | Yuriy Timen (Grammarly, Canva, Airtable)

## Transcript

Yuriy Timen (00:00:00):
The only thing that's worse than a channel or a tactic that you tried not working. The only thing that's worse now is when you didn't give it the appropriate shot, right? And you prematurely were erroneously concluded that it doesn't work and it's remarkable how often you find that to be the case when I talk to companies, "Oh, YouTube, we tried it. It doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay, can I see what you've tried?" And then you look at it and you're like, "Oh, this thing was not designed to even have a shot at working from the get go."

Lenny (00:00:40):
Yuriy Timen is a full-time advisor to companies looking to figure out their growth strategy. He's worked with companies like Canva, Airtable, Otter, Whimsical, Hims, Flow Health, and a dozen others. I know a number of founders who have worked with Yuriy and they all tell me that he transformed how they think about their growth. Before becoming an advisor, he spent nine years at Grammarly where he led growth in marketing and helped turn that into the household name that it is today.

Lenny (00:01:07):
In our chat, we get incredibly tactical about all of the ways that you can grow your product, including when and how to invest in virality, SEO, and paid growth. What's changing across each of those channels and the most common failure modes for B2C startups. This is the most tactical and actionable conversation I have had yet on how to grow your product, particularly a subscription product. And I'm really excited for you to hear it. With that I bring you Yuriy Timen.

Lenny (00:01:36):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flat File. How many B2B SAS companies would you estimate B to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:44):
At least 40%?

Lenny (00:01:46):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:49):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:08):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup, conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:23):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:03:50):
Yuriy, welcome to the podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:52):
Thanks for having me man. This is great.

Lenny (00:03:55):
It's even better for me.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:57):
All right.

Lenny (00:03:58):
So I'm going to give a quick bio. Let me know if I missed anything really important. You were head of growth at Grammarly. You spent nine years there kind of doing all the things that helped turn that company into the killer product that it is today. You left that I think a couple years ago. Now you're advising companies mostly full-time. I think mostly on growth strategy. I think mostly consumer startups, is that about right?

Yuriy Timen (00:04:21):
A couple of super critical corrections. Number one, it was only eight and a half years.

Lenny (00:04:26):
Okay. Usually people round those up. I'm impressed that you get-

Yuriy Timen (00:04:31):
I think eight and a half is long enough. Yeah, not sure I want to round up. I know, but I'm kidding obviously. Yeah. That's largely it. Grammarly was a hell of a run and trying to take a step back from that, and stepping back has kind of taken on a life of its own vis a vis advising.

Lenny (00:04:54):
How many companies have you worked with at this point advised and what are some examples, just like companies people would know.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:01):
It's now been about, I guess two years and three months since my last day at Grammarly in an operating capacity. I've probably worked with maybe 15 companies in the last two and a little bit of years. Obviously, not all at once. It's usually four to five at any given point in time. But some of the ones that I've been really lucked out with in terms of getting aligned with companies like Canva, Airtable, Hims and Hers in the personal care space, there is otter.ai. Who else? Flow Health, the world's most downloaded period tracker.

Lenny (00:05:47):
I used that for my wife. It's handy.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:49):
Good, good. Yeah. I was trying to get my wife to try it out, but been unsuccessful.

Lenny (00:05:59):
You're failing in your growth.

Yuriy Timen (00:06:01):
She was like, "Are you trying to push me to having a third kid?" I was like, "No, no, I swear." This is just product testing.

Lenny (00:06:08):
Clever. So I've had Casey Winters on this podcast and Elena Verna. It's kind of like the three of you that it feels like have worked with the most companies as advisors. I don't know if there's some kind of contest y'all have or anything, but do you think about that at all? Is there anyone else out there that you think is in the running?

Yuriy Timen (00:06:26):
First of all, just being mentioned the same breath as those two is an accolade in and of itself. I mean, I look up to both of them. They've gone first. Also, I credit a lot of my getting started to both of them because they've been very generous with their time when I was just kind of considering advising, especially Casey, if they listen to this. Huge shine out to both of them, but Casey especially. He's such immense when it comes to just being generous with his time. So no, there is no competition, but had there been one, I suspect I'd be in lead right now because I've done it. I've done it in a shorter period of time. I'm much newer to advising than both of those, but no, I have a ton of aberration respect both of them. They're phenomenal what they do and I learned a ton from them.

Lenny (00:07:24):
I love that acceleration is fastest. Wow, sweet. So we're going to talk a lot about consumer growth strategies and your experience working with companies and a bunch of insights on things you've learned from working with companies. Before we get there just one quick question in your advising. I'm curious how many companies do you work with at once normally?

Yuriy Timen (00:07:43):
Yeah, so I play around with different quantities. So a couple of things. So you mentioned, you alluded to earlier that I advise full time. What I'll say is that mostly the only thing that I do right now professionally is advising, but it's not quite full time. I hard count my week at about three to three and a half days a week worth of work, which is a personal choice. And so that is a hard constraint that I'm working with. And within that constraint, I also feel like for me to do my best work and the work that I also enjoy the most and find the most fulfilling four to five companies is probably the max. If I try to go beyond that, the overhead that it creates in terms of the cost of context switching just becomes overwhelming. I feel like I'm not showing up as best as I can with each individual company.

Lenny (00:08:43):
As early plug or anti plug, depending on how you answer this. Are you looking for more companies to work with right now or are you just like, "Don't even try. I am so at capacity right now."?

Yuriy Timen (00:08:53):
I'm so at capacity right now. I've also just been very fortunate to always be at capacity. But I think for every four to five companies that I'm working with, think of it as a concentric circles, right? There are another, maybe 10 to a dozen companies that we're actively exploring if we want to work together in the future. And then there is another concentric circle so maybe 30 plus companies that I'm just friends with. So I'll take the plug. I'm always up for meeting Austin founders working on important problems.

Lenny (00:09:31):
Cool. Well, we're in the plug I guess. How do people find you online? What's your Twitter?

Yuriy Timen (00:09:34):
I mean, honestly, probably throw Lenny's podcast. That's one, but honestly LinkedIn is really the only place I'm pretty low key otherwise.

Lenny (00:09:45):
Okay, great. That was a lot of Meta stuff. So let's get into some meat stuff here. So you talked to a lot of consumer startups. You help them figure out how to grow, how to evolve their product, something I'm always curious about and I love your thoughts on is when you look at a consumer startup, I imagine there's a few archetypes of how they grow. I'm curious if that's a mental model you use when you're like, "Oh, I see company X. They're probably going to grow this way, and here's what they should focus on." How do you see that?

Yuriy Timen (00:10:11):
Great question. I think there are ways to answer that. My sweet spot is subscription properties and it's not just consumer. I do work with a lot of B2B companies. It's just that most of them, but what they all have in common is they lean into consumerized type of growth loops and growth motions. So they're very kind of self-serve nature or have meaningful self-serve engines. So if I think about subscription companies, I think there are probably a couple of buckets that I see them falling into. If you were able to nail your unit economics and you have really strong consumer LTVs, think Grammarly, think Canva. The single player LTVs for those companies are very, very high. They're kind of average S&B LTVs for B2B companies.

Lenny (00:11:03):
What's a number there just for folks to have a little context?

Yuriy Timen (00:11:06):
I'm not a liberty to speak to those, but we're talking in the hundreds of dollars. Most consumer subscription companies that are $5 to $7 a month. Their LTVs typically cap out at 50 to 60 bucks.

Lenny (00:11:25):
Cool.

Yuriy Timen (00:11:26):
And so if you have really healthy LTVs, and that usually means that you're attracting a proconsumer buyer, so they may be single player, but they're using it for work. And so maybe they're dispensing it or just the perceived value so much higher that they're willing to bear that $120 and $130 a year subscription. If I'm seeing things like that and I'm seeing that you're converting seven, like five plus percent of your free users to a paid subscriber, then there is a big opportunity to play paid and lean into paid growth loops and paid acquisition loops. There is another archetype, which is if there are network effects for instance, you don't find that as much with single player consumer subscription companies, but obviously social media, consumer companies.

Yuriy Timen (00:12:17):
There may be a strong referral viral loop angle if the utility increases, the utility of the product increases, the more users are using it. Another archetype I see are companies that can lead into SEO very heavily, especially if there is a long tail programmatic angle. Take Canva for instance, their biggest initial growth loop and I think this is public knowledge was their long tail SEO strategy where any kind of design project that you could think of would search for designing. It's kind of two categories of keywords, make keywords and template keywords. So if you're searching for a template of any kind, a wedding invitation, yada yada, they had incredibly strong SEO and they were just capitalizing on all the long tail traffic. Not every product is going to lend itself to that, but I always look for that early on, because you can build incredible mold with that kind of strategy.

Lenny (00:13:21):
That makes sense. There's kind of like these three engines that you can tap into. I imagine the preference would be word of mouth reality and then if that isn't going to work SEO, and if that is going to work paid, maybe just to simplify it for listeners, what are kind of signals you can go after virality and invest in that and think that could work because every founder would be like, "Yes, virality. That's how I'm going to grow." Yeah.

Yuriy Timen (00:13:47):
Yeah. Honestly, the first thing you look for is that, is there inherent product network effects? It's something that it's either there, or isn't from inception from my experience. I think it's very difficult to manufacture. You'd only study when... It's very hard to manufacture product network effects if they aren't there from the get go. So Airbnb from your days, obviously marketplace very strong product network effect dynamics. You think of collaboration tools, Airtable, monday.com, Whimsical, whom we both know very strong inherent product network effects, contrast that with a company like Grammarly. It just wasn't there. It's not an inherently multiplayer task constructed communication. And so you can try to engineer that, but from my experience, it is an uphill battle. So if you have inherent product network effects, that's when I think layering on referral loops and viral loops. You think about what Dropbox has done around file sharing. That's an iconic example.

Yuriy Timen (00:15:02):
Then it's really powerful. I think that there is another case where referral and viral loops could work even when there are inherent network effects. If you have a really beloved product, beloved brand. There's a company out of Australia that I have opportunity to invest it called Laika. They do fresh dog food subscriptions and incredibly beloved brand, a premium product. And so they're able to lean into a give one, get one referrals, even though there isn't inherent product network effects, they're still able to generate meaningful results off of the, and incentivize referring program.

Lenny (00:15:39):
When you talk about network effects, what does that mean to you? How would you define that briefly?

Yuriy Timen (00:15:45):
Yeah, to me, I mean, honestly I define it I think probably a pretty quintessential way, which is for every individual user, the utility that they derive from the product increases the more users there are on the platform. The expanded version of that is in a case of marketplaces. It may not be the bore users broadly speaking, but the more users in the markets that you care about, in the case of collaboration tools, it's not the more users in abstract terms. It's the more users within your team, the more users within your company, right? That correlates with your kind of the rise in your utility curve.

Lenny (00:16:33):
Awesome. So if you have network effects, AKA if the product becomes more useful with more people or there's amazing word of mouth already, or there's collaboration, probably a good sign that you could lean into virality or maybe referrals. What about SEO?

Yuriy Timen (00:16:50):
Oh, that's a good one. It's a very timely question because I actually in a process of helping a couple of my companies figure out if it's the right time to invest in SEO. So I've been sort of a forefront of taking exploratory meetings with agencies and SEO consultants and things like that. I mean, I would say the first thing to figure... I mean, there are a couple of pillars, because obviously we all know that SEO has a different return horizon than say paid acquisition. It's longer out. It's maybe six months is the earliest you can see results. Even then it's going to be a small trickle that compounds over time, if you're successful or you may spend three to six months leaning into an SEO strategy and then realize that it's not going to back out typically at least in historically a company probably isn't like Series B before it starts feeling like it passed a luxury of making these kind of medium to long term investments.

Yuriy Timen (00:17:58):
But I think that's shifting right now, but that's maybe a topic for later or even for another bot but a lot of the strategies that I think we're reserved for Series B are trickling down to Series A companies because they have to diversify way for pay, but maybe more on that later. So I think with SEO, it's like the first pillar I would say is, do you have a unique angle when you take a look at the SEO landscape today, you look at editorial, the landscape, which is to how to searches and who are the players there and what kind of information is being offered? Do you have something unique to contribute to that conversation? Another thing if I have to do an audit checklist, another thing is, do you have a unique programmatic angle, right? For instance, Canva did dealt with templates. Who else is programmatic?

Yuriy Timen (00:18:54):
CWELL, Redfit, obviously all the real estate, right? That's really strong-

Lenny (00:19:00):
Saint Pier.

Yuriy Timen (00:19:01):
Saint Pier, right. So do you have a programmatic angle and then understanding the competitive landscape or the other one is, do you have a unique data angle? So for instance, a company I work with called Monarch Money, which is in the personal finance management space. Think of it as a new and improved version of MIT. There is a lot of users are connecting accounts and you have a sense percenting patterns and things like that. Clearly there is a unique data, and so it's a question of, can you turn it into some kind of valuable organic search experience?

Yuriy Timen (00:19:39):
I won't go into too much detail in terms of what we're thinking of there, but that's another checkbox. If you can check two of those three boxes as a back of the envelope framework, you may be in good shape. And then it's a question of like, "How can you lower the cost of experimentation SEO as much as possible?" I think as a rule of thumb, if you can time box it to three months, what can I do at the end of three months? Is this likely to work or not?

Lenny (00:20:14):
Awesome. Couple follow up questions.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:20:16):
One is SEO feels like this dark art where you need some SEO wizard to come help you through this.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:20:25):
Do you suggest companies find somebody or work with an agency or something else? What's your general feeling on SEO versus some other route?

Yuriy Timen (00:20:33):
I think SEO is pretty specialized skill set. There are some basic principles that always hold like best content wins and don't do shady back linking and make sure that you're on page. SEO is good and your pages are easily crawl, but I feel like everybody knows that. And where the winners are determined are between the lines. Better than a sports' analogy? Maybe you can.

Lenny (00:21:10):
Between the lines. I don't know what that comes from.

Yuriy Timen (00:21:15):
But anyway, what I mean is that there is a lot of more nuance, SEO developments and angles, where I think is where the opportunity really lies to differentiate yourself. And that requires keeping up with the latest algorithm changes. It's very hard to do that unless you are specializing in the art where the black magic of SEO, and so that's why I think getting an outside resource at least for an audit is really helpful. Now, whether it's a boutique agency or a solo consultant, I think that's more circumstantial, but I've found at least with the companies that I've worked with, if we wanted to quickly vet the SEO opportunity, I can do it in a very kind of amateur, at an amateur level.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:02):
Plug things into similar web and try to figure out the right option is there, but you can get these relatively inexpensive audits done from companies that you can then choose. Do I hire them to help with my SEO or not? But I think that audit is usually a very good use of time because they have templates. So what they can turn around for five to 10K would take you many, many human hours to try to pull together yourself.

Lenny (00:22:28):
Awesome. Are there agencies that you want to name that people can go check out or would you prefer just to keep it from having-

Yuriy Timen (00:22:35):
I'll give one plug.

Lenny (00:22:37):
Great.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:37):
I think one of the most innovative, disciplined first principles SEO thinkers and I have met is Ethan Smith from Graphite. It's not for everyone. It's a pretty high end SEO shell. So I wouldn't send the Series a company there, but Ethan also produces a lot of resources and what they've been focusing on at Graphite lately has been actually automating a lot of their work and turning it into SAS. So I don't know how far along they are, but you could probably already get into some of the betas from the tools that they're offering.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Sweet. I'm going to try to get Ethan on this podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:21):
I've seen his stuff and it's awesome.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:23):
Yeah. He is a math scientist when it comes to SEO. Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:25):
We need those. We need math scientist on ship.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:28):
Right.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Okay. So we've talked about virality talked about SEO, paid. Imagine that's pretty straightforward if your LTV are high enough and you can pay back ads on those, then that's where you go. Imagine everyone can try it. Doesn't work for everyone. What if yeah, anything you want to add there?

Yuriy Timen (00:23:43):
I mean, there's a lot. There's a lot. I mean, I don't know how deep you want to go down the paid rabbit hole because it's changing. It's probably the most affected growth bucket in light of the market turbulence, the venture sentiment shifting. I've seen paying acquisition strategies at budgets. They are at the brunt of that fallout. And so the question is where do you want to go there?

Lenny (00:24:16):
Yeah. That's a really good topic. I was saving that for later, but let's chat it better right now.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:20):
I imagine part of this is Apple's tracking changes too.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:22):
So I guess my big question is paid still lucrative and a good path for many companies is like 50% of the time less effective. How do you see that shifting recently? And how should people think about paid in the consumer subscription startup?

Yuriy Timen (00:24:38):
Well, I think in the short term, let's break it down into phases. I think in the short term paid acquisition and just paid media dollars are contracted and we're seeing it already with Metas advertising revenue, Snaps advertising revenue. There's clearly a global contraction happening to paid media budgets. A big part of it is because all of a sudden the definition of efficient acquisition and good payback windows is shifting. So before for a consumer subscription company, 12 month payback was decent. Now it's like, you better pay back your paid media in six months or less. That's the sentiment.

Yuriy Timen (00:25:23):
So the thought is reaction is like anything that's more than six months we're well board of six months, we're cutting that and so there's that. Then there is just less tolerance for ambiguity and attribution when the sentiment is like, "Let's grow at [inaudible 00:25:38]. Grow at all costs." If you can't attribute things perfectly, that's okay. Now it's like, especially with venture back companies, you have to have two plus years of runway, managers burn a lot more diligently now. And so whatever you can't attribute to sales sue like, "That shits got to go." I don't know if we can curse on the pod or not.

Lenny (00:25:59):
Only available-

Yuriy Timen (00:26:03):
Well, I've been holding back for the last 30 minutes. No, I'm kidding.

Lenny (00:26:03):
At least.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:04):
All right.

Lenny (00:26:05):
We're not kid friendly, but nobody's cursed yet. So this could be okay. So you'll be the first.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:09):
All right. Way loud. All right. But anyways, yeah. So I think there is a short term contraction. However, that opens up an opportunity for smart kind of attribution investments. So you're seeing an emergence of some interesting attribution related attribution for incrementality related products. A couple that I personally started exploring and looking into, and then you just see a lot more heads of growth, heads of user acquisition, thinking about attribution in building their attribution stacks. And so I think that once we settle into some kind of new normal, which is going to be a combination of just better attribution stack on average for companies combined with just the level of acceptance, that attribution will never be as good as it maybe once was. We're going to probably get hit. Come out of that and you'll see paid budgets start making their way back. But even right now, during contraction, there are going to be some winners.

Yuriy Timen (00:27:26):
The companies that had strong cash positions, have strong unit economics, strong paid back periods already like Grammarly, Canva to name two that I know personally. A couple of others or many others probably, they're going to be winners because all of a sudden, if previously they were competing with companies who were nowhere as efficient as them, but for whatever reason had the green light to keep spending, now all of those are going to pull back their budgets. And so those that have been disciplined, have the instrumentation to track things better than average. They're going to benefit from decreased competition on app platforms, decreasing CPMs, et cetera. So they're going to do winners for sure.

Lenny (00:28:09):
Wow. Haven't heard this perspective. It's so interesting that the fact that it's gotten harder, it's creating new opportunities for companies to do it better and more intelligently. You said you mentioned a couple tools products that you found to be potentially helpful in this. Is there anything you could mention there?

Yuriy Timen (00:28:22):
Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned a couple that I've kind of connected with in the last couple of months. So first of all, Media Mix Modeling is making a comeback, which is something that kind of got popularized in the math meant kind of advertising era of the fifties, pre-digital, and that's how that was the piece of the methodology. I can't speak of the specifics there. The science is a little bit out of depth there, but it was basically a way to use some data to determine a budget allocation across channels at the time was probably newspapers and billboards, et etcetera.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:03):
It was leveraging data to some extent. You would were doing it maybe on a quarterly basis. And then you would only update it every quarter. There was no way with media mix modeling. There was no way to adjust budget in quarter because you weren't getting the data feedback loop that frequently. But media mix modeling is now making a comeback because there are so many offline channels that are part of folks channel portfolio today and that plus a lot of the online channels are becoming less trackable like Meta for instance, with the iOS 14 shift. And so Media Mix Modeling is going to comeback and the company that's leading the charge of bringing the Media Mix Modeling methodology of the traditional advertising era and ushering it into the digital world is a company called the Recast.

Lenny (00:29:48):
Recast.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:48):
Recast. Yeah. So I've heard really good things. I haven't tried them with any of my companies yet, but there are a couple that are on the horizon hopefully.

Lenny (00:29:58):
Double click there for a moment. Is that still useful if you're not doing TV and other forms of advertising?

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
I think it's still-

Lenny (00:30:04):
You're just doing-

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
Yeah, I think it's useful if you're spending a considerable amount, what's considerable, I'd say worth of a hundred thousand a month update media. And if you have some level of channel complexity, so you're not just like a Google Go or a Facebook, but maybe you're on three plus the channels. Then I think it still makes sense. The other ones in the incremental space, they have very different methodologists actually, because at end of the day, this might be obvious to folks, but maybe some will find value.

Yuriy Timen (00:30:34):
Click based attribution or the digital attribution were all fawning over cookie based and click based, a real parameter based attribution. It never demonstrated a causal relationship between our media spend and business results. It was only good for correlative insights. And the only way to determine causality is through real controlled experiments, randomized control experiments through incrementality testing, which is typically really hard to do cleanly and also companies have always been often wary about doing it because you have to turn off a channel potentially in a key demo and you're like, "Yeah." The benefit is to learning of whether it's actually incremental, but the cost or the sales that I will lose today. But the only way to really know how effective your paid media is through ongoing incrementality testing. So there are two companies that are addressing that. Two that I'm excited about. One is measured, can be found, measured.call, amazing domain name.

Lenny (00:31:44):
Amazing domain name, go with that.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:45):
And then the other one is incremental, but incremental-

Lenny (00:31:50):
Outcome.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:51):
... no vows except the last A between the T and the L.

Lenny (00:31:57):
Excellent, great job.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:58):
So many free plugs today.

Lenny (00:32:00):
Yeah. I love it. That's great. This is what people need. They're just like, "Okay, what do I actually do"? And so the more it's clear what to actually try and how to solve these problems. The more people can actually make change. I had a couple questions here that I wanted to follow up on. One is founders might be listening to this and they're like, "Amazing. Okay, we're going to grow. There's three ways to grow. Let's do it all. Get someone on SEO to get Jane on paid. Let's get Fred on virality."

Yuriy Timen (00:32:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:32:32):
So in your experience, is it smart to focus on one and then expand down the road or try them all see which one works best? How do you advise companies think about these options?

Yuriy Timen (00:32:44):
I would say focus paired with rapid iterations, right? With limited resources. Naturally you have to practice some form of essentialism and ruthless prioritization, but at the same time, the clock is always ticking. You can not burn. That there is a finite number of tries that you have at finding what works, right? What's going to help you unlock the next level of growth, get to the next funding round, extend your runway. And so I think either one taking to an extreme focus or trying multiple things is not a good thing. And just in case, it's not obvious if you focus on one thing and it ends up being the wrong thing, you've wasted really valuable time and now you have so much less time left to find something that does work. Spreading yourself very thin oftentimes in the early stage companies, it's one person who's in charge of all of growth, but they also have some other kind of responsibilities like maybe ops and customer success.

Yuriy Timen (00:33:54):
If you get them to try five different things, they may not try them anyone individually fully enough, because I like to say the only thing that's worse than a channel or a tactic that you tried not working. The only thing that's worse now is when you didn't give it the appropriate shot and you pretty much surely or erroneously concluded that it doesn't work. And it's remarkable how often you find that to be the case when I talk to companies, "Oh, YouTube, we tried it doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay, can I see what you've tried?" And then you look at it and you're like, "Oh, this thing was not designed to even have a shot at working from the get go." So to answer your question, I think it's focus with some guard rails so that you know exactly when it's time to move on to the next thing.

Lenny (00:34:51):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B Testing platform built by Airbnb alums for Modern Growth Teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

Lenny (00:35:21):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I love about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. Geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:36:01):
This might be too hard to answer in a chat like this, but do you have any guidance for how to know when you've gone far enough? I imagine there's a lot nuance and detail there. Is there anything that you could share?

Yuriy Timen (00:36:12):
Love the question. It's very thought provoking. I think with some tactics and some channels you can fairly objectively create some test guard rails where it's like, if it's YouTube, we know kind of minimum number of impressions that you got to get. Try two to three creative angles. Here's the click through rates range that you're looking for. If you get within these ranges on these KPIs, keep going. If you don't, abandon.

Yuriy Timen (00:36:48):
I think that's important to also know that abandonment doesn't mean we will never revisit it again, right? It just means that because every time you're evaluating, the concept of sunk cost. So you have these periodic, I think periods of reevaluation where it's like, "Okay, did we try enough? Is this more art than science frankly." It's like, "What's the incremental lift for us as a team to try to experiment with the next phase of this channel or this tactic? What is the opportunity cost of that? What are the other high profile things that we could be trying?" You were right and save this topic too hard to answer in this format, but I would break things down maybe into two types. There are some channels or tactics where you can objectively figure out som guard rails for when it's showing promise or not, because you can pull benchmarks on good click through rates and things like that. Then there are other tactics where you just have to exercise more judgment outside of benchmarks.

Lenny (00:37:54):
Yeah. Yeah. That was actually really valuable and very challenging question to try to summarize quickly so thank you. One more quick question along these lines. So you talked about these three broad ways companies grow. Oftentimes a couple of them work, something I've seen and I'm curious if you agree, usually one is like 80% of your growth and then you layer on a couple more to optimize. Is that what you see?

Yuriy Timen (00:38:18):
Yes. I think companies that we know and admire and reference in case studies or in podcast, such as this one. From the outside looking in, you oftentimes assume that it's a highly diversified growth engine. I have to say it's often not the case. Definitely the 80/20 applies. There is a kind of strategy that's working overwhelmingly well, and there is a scramble internally to minimize reliance on that one thing. And on the discover slash on the walk, the next step function, the next growth horizon. In the case of Grammarly, it was performance marketing kind of over reliance on performance marketing during part of the company's life cycle. And so it was like, "Okay, this thing is working." It's efficient so you don't want to stop pouring fire on it, but you're also thinking months and years ahead, what kind of risk does it open you up to?

Yuriy Timen (00:39:35):
And so there is a scramble to fight and at Grammarly, it's been successful there. With Canva, it was the SEO angle. So for them, that was working really well, which is more defensible than paid. That's sort of long tail programmatic SEO angle, but look, you're always susceptible to Google algorithm updates and so how do you derisk yourself from that? But to your point, yes. And I think that surprising thing to people probably is that it's also the case with some later stage companies. It's not just early stage companies that are kind of one trick pulleys. Sometimes it's later stage companies as well.

Lenny (00:40:11):
This makes me think about is there's kind of these three phases to growth. There's the kickstart phase where you're just doing a bunch of stuff, trying to get things moving. Then there's that you discover your first main growth engine and then there's layer on additional engines because you want to diversify.

Yuriy Timen (00:40:25):
Yep. And one interesting, what I believe is an interesting period and a lot of it is gut feel, right? And I try to direct companies. I encounter sometimes early stage companies is when one thing is working well and they're already worried about over reliance and they're starting to talk about diversification and I come in all the times and I see showing up in their OKRs. I come, "No, no. Too early. I'm glad that you're such a forward thinker. Put all of your energy. Sure, this one tactic is accounting for say 80 plus percent of your new user acquisition, but your user acquisition is still small. So don't get distracted with diversification. We'll get there. Lean more into this, hit this growth rates, stand this up. Build this into a real strategic advantages thing that's working."

Yuriy Timen (00:41:17):
So I actually have to talk them out, focusing on diversification too early. Contrast that with some later stage companies for who are... At scale, I know 50 plus million ARR, 90 plus percent reliant on a single acquisition channel, which just mire with risk and diversification is a blind spot for them. And then with those, I have to be like, "Hey y'all. Here's the risk that you're carrying. Let's start carving out bandwidth resources to try to go and explore these other channels with tactics."

Lenny (00:41:49):
That's such an important point. It reminds me Casey has this hilarious line that he uses that the money's always in the banana stand or there's always more money in the banana stand from [inaudible 00:41:59] development. That basically your growth is probably going to come from the same place it's already come from.

Yuriy Timen (00:42:03):
Yep.

Lenny (00:42:04):
And that you shouldn't take that for granted. And you should put most of your efforts into continuing to optimize that versus being distracted by, "Oh, let's do SEO now."

Yuriy Timen (00:42:11):
I see that argument for sure.

Lenny (00:42:13):
So you mentioned at this point about how later stage growth strategies are starting to move earlier into growth strategy planning. I'd love to hear more on that.

Yuriy Timen (00:42:22):
Yeah. Let me expand on that in the world that we lived in last 18 months, or let's say up until say three to five months ago. We were living in a world where funding was abundant and plentiful, startups were conditions to think that they could raise twice a year. Valuations were quite toppling within a year. You raise in January and then you raise in November and your valuation five X. And so companies were coming off of these ridiculous Series As of 15 to 25 million dollar As and they were like, "We got to grow as quickly as possible. What can we activate to give us immediate return?" And the answer is almost always paid. That one going to give you, especially if you're think you want to go back to raising less than 12 months later, that forces you to focus on very kind of short term tactics, short payoff tactics.

Yuriy Timen (00:43:28):
And so things that SEO, there was no room to think about that for early stage companies. Because payoff is going to come maybe in 12 months in terms of meaningful payoff. We care about getting to the next round and maximizing our valuation between now and then. SEO is for the grown up companies. When we're that we could think about it. And they were getting the reinforcement from everywhere, from peers, from VCs. It's like it's growth, growth, growth. The growth at any cause.

Yuriy Timen (00:44:02):
I think what happened now and we'll see where things stabilized because I think we're still in the midst of a little bit of chaos. What's happening now is the same VCs are saying, "Okay, it's now survival." You have to extend your runway, minimize burn, high burning if you have to. And all of a sudden growth, whether explicitly or via inference becomes kind of a secondary objective, especially for all these companies that are far from being cash flow positive. They have to figure out how to stay alive, but not have to go back to the market and be sort of a victim of shitty terms. And so I feel this is me extrapolating because venture capitalist didn't actually tell me this, but I'm extrapolating that growth is a secondary objective now. It's really focusing on sustainability due to economics, accepting your runway control your destiny, getting to default life.

Yuriy Timen (00:45:00):
And all of a sudden it's like, "Okay. Plus paid is a lot less attractive now. Can't afford to be acquiring users at like LTV cap one to one." That's now a no-no. And so SEO is now becoming more attractive because once you got your burn under control and you're thinking, "Okay, we saved all this money by reducing our paid budget. We're cutting it entirely. How do we put some of those resources back to work?" And all of a sudden SEO starts looking a lot more lucrative because it's almost like you took the urgency of grow at any cost in the next six months, you took that out of the equation. So now it's like we're in a position where we don't have to go back to raising 12, 18, 24 months. We have 18, 24 months worth of runway and now companies are starting to think more in terms of building more sort of sustainable and defensible growth initiatives.

Lenny (00:46:02):
Fascinating. And as much as people may want to do SEO, like we talked about earlier, doesn't mean they will be able to pull it off because there's these things that have to be approved for your type of company and-

Yuriy Timen (00:46:12):
Yes.

Lenny (00:46:12):
Yeah. Going back to point you made earlier about paid being a really interesting opportunity right now because it's become harder. Would you say generally you're kind of like pro, tri paid, go paid be in this time because I'm finding a lot of startups are like, "Oh, we can't do paid anymore. We're trying all these other approaches to grow." Is that like alpha right now? Start thinking about paid in a creative way and maybe this is going to be a huge advantage.

Yuriy Timen (00:46:35):
So there are two pieces to do paid. I mean I'm oversimplifying, but I think people will hopefully appreciate the over the oversimplification. Number one, because it actually drives returns at efficient unit economic, whatever that may mean for your company, your business, your industry. The other way to do it is because it's a very quick way to get learnings on messaging and positioning on designs on features. You're thinking of launching et cetera, right? It's hard to get faster learnings at scale than A/B testing headlines, Google search or whatever. I think the problem that I find is when a company can't have which camper in or where they try to say that they're in both, but really it's like, "Okay, you're funneling a hundred K a month." It's super inefficient and they're not even running experiments to actually get the learnings. I can assess the company, even if I don't download the industry as well, based on just seeing their funnel performance, their conversion rates, their retention curves, their LTDs, understanding their churn.

Yuriy Timen (00:47:43):
I could say whether they stand the chance at making paid work as a former strategy. So not just the learning mechanism, not just the kind of a feedback engine, but actually a profitable at delivering acquisition channel or strategy. And if I see that they're not there because the funnel doesn't convert well, the users don't retain the LTDs are too low. Then I say, "Hey, it's not time for paid. Maybe car on a little bit of budget if you want to quickly test positioning and things like that. But it's just too soon." But instead I encounter a company that's really healthy conversion rates, strong LTDs. I do a little bit of competitor research and I can see where the opportunities are, which channels are less saturated than others. Then I may say, "Hey, it's worth it. It's worth a go." And also just seeing the bigger picture of their financial health, how much runway do you have? What does your monthly burn look like?

Lenny (00:48:41):
Right? Because paids like cash going out the door and it will return hopefully at some point might be six months might be a year, and so that's a real constraint. You mentioned onboarding and funnel conversion. Two questions there. One, do you have a heuristic of here's good for conversion rates? Is there something that you think about there that you could share or is it very case dependent?

Yuriy Timen (00:49:03):
I think it's case dependent, but yeah, it is. It's not case dependent. It's category dependent. So it's not that every company is so case, but it's like, we got to know about what buckets we're talking about. I will say that... Let's say we talk about prosumer premium SAS, ala Grammarly, ala Canva, Whimsical, InVideo, things like that. Yeah. I can confidently say a healthy website visit to a free user, a free account creation conversion rate. It's probably in that 20 to 35% range.

Lenny (00:49:43):
From landing on the site to signing up?

Yuriy Timen (00:49:45):
From landing on site to a free user at scale. Earlier stage, you have strong product market fit with some kind of small audience segment that conversion can be 40 to 50%, but as you go broader, it'll probably asymptote at like 25, 30%. What about a conversion if you're premium from a free user to a premium account or paying account? I think anything under 5% is not going to work long term, regardless of how big your top of funnel is. You may get the soft point, but for you to remain an independent company continuously growing pre IPO, I don't think it's going to happen. It's got to be north of 5%, ideally like more than 7%.

Lenny (00:50:39):
Wow. Super handy. On the onboarding point, what's your thoughts on investing in onboarding and that part foe of how often is that a fruitful area of investment?

Yuriy Timen (00:50:49):
Almost always. A lot of my work is in that sort of a prosumer space. So the products tend to be more complex. Airtable, whimsical, Canva, InVideo. They're very robust products. And so it's very easy to get lost in their editors. I think what all of those companies are trying to do for their respective verticals and use cases is they're trying to democratize access to fades that previously you have to rely on professionals for. Maybe in the case of bayer team bot, it's your engineers. In the case of PM bot, it is professional graphic designers. In the case of a video, it's professional video editors. So when they're trying to democratize access, but they're also trying to make the products robust enough to be comparable to a professional great quality. And it's a very difficult place to play it, right? It's like, how do you make it simple enough where a nonprofessional can use it, but robust enough where they go and say, "Oh yeah, this is as good as if I would've hired a professional fill in the blank."

Yuriy Timen (00:52:19):
And that's where onboarding, sorry for the long answer. That's where onboarding is really, really important because there's such a huge difference between landing someone on that initial editor page, be it Airtable, Canva having that left to their own devices versus getting as much information or as much relevant information front and then customizing that landing experience for them. So that if they're there to do X and we know XYZ about them, we're able to guide them and not expose them to the robustness of the product all at once. So the short answer is almost all the time onboarding is a big opportunity.

Lenny (00:53:04):
Awesome. That's what I was expecting to hear, to give folks some context. What's kind of an order magnitude that you've seen improvement on onboarding and maybe impact on a company improving onboarding.

Yuriy Timen (00:53:15):
Earlier stage companies where still haven't really approached the local maximal, but you haven't experimented with a ton of things. I mean, you can two to four X activation rates easily through onboarding. I think later stage companies like maybe Series B beyond, I think you can still probably get to 20 to 30% lift at activations. It depends on how many low hanging fruit are left to tackle.

Lenny (00:53:46):
That makes sense. Yeah. Till the onboarding, there's always money in the onboarding banana stand. On that kind of same idea, do you have a general feeling of investments in this stuff often pays off and helps you grow and is often higher ROI and investments in bucket B are rarely successful. What would those two buckets be?

Yuriy Timen (00:54:07):
So thinking of investments rawly, right? Not just monetarily.

Lenny (00:54:13):
Yeah. Yeah. Time and resources.

Yuriy Timen (00:54:15):
Yeah. I mean, I would say that getting to know your customer always pays off. So it's user interviews and getting to know your market, your customers, and your prospects always pays off. Customer research, inside surveying, interviewing panels incredibly useful. And I found that to be very especially early stages. The amount of clarity at momentum that it can create inside of a seed Series A up to Series B company when you first do some proper research push. The way it can galvanize the team and give them focus and clarity and purpose is remarkable. So that always pays off. What doesn't pay off? I mean, I think over reliance on paid, it comes to bite you in the rear end. When I think about tracking an attribution, I think it's a question of the right level of investment at the right stage.

Yuriy Timen (00:55:19):
Rarely do companies get it right. They usually fall into one of two buckets where they underinvest in attribution and they are now, their budgets are up high. They have a broad channel portfolio and they have a hard time figuring out what's working, what isn't and they just get into this inertia. It's like, "Well, overall, the company's been growing and it's been growing roughly over the same time that we've been increasing our spend. We're scared to break it. So we're just going to keep spending." Or companies that read horror stories about other companies overspending. They sometimes try to invest in attribution too much, believe it or not where they're trying to get everything perfect and scientifically pure. But what they don't realize is that the payoff may not always be there. And so how do I fit this into your question of, I think tracking attribution incrementality is definitely a worthwhile investment arena, but it could both be a good or bad depending on the level. So you got to make sure the level investment is appropriate for your stage when you stand to aim for-

Lenny (00:56:35):
Awesome. You're such a good interviewee that you come back to the question.

Yuriy Timen (00:56:39):
No, that I promise.

Lenny (00:56:40):
That was great. Okay. One last question. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I'd love you to get your thoughts on advertising on TikTok and YouTube and broadly is there any other tactics, avenues that you think are kind of underutilized or emerging that folks should be thinking about?

Yuriy Timen (00:56:58):
Yeah. So TikTok, one thing I'll say about TikTok is I'm seeing it come up more and more as a channel that works well. And sometimes even the most efficient channel, most efficient digital channel for some brands. But I think that the thing about TikTok that oftentimes I was surprised about is you often hear, "Oh, TikTok that's for the 15 to 22 year olds." I'm bad with my gens Z and oh, my audience is different. So I'm just going to ignore the champ. TikTok has so many users and it's still so relatively unsaturated with advertisers that your audience is on there. You'd be surprised.

Yuriy Timen (00:57:46):
I've worked with brands that their core demo is like 40 plus married making 200K plus in household annual income. And you wouldn't think that demo is on TikTok and it is. So what point about TikTok? Other channels, I think out at home is still not getting enough love. Podcasts? Okay. Yep, yep.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Spots through this one. I recall you heard it from Yuriy.

Yuriy Timen (00:58:17):
Direct mail, what has happened? They've gotten better with attribution because before a lot of those channels were written off as sort of attribution is just too hard on there and attribution is so good and reliable on digital. So that's that gap that canyon that existed in attribution capabilities of online and offline, deterred a lot of people from offline. Today offline has gotten better and actually positioning themselves as being able to do attribution, but also online attribution is deteriorated. So all of a sudden that argument kind of slimmed out a little bit and I'm seeing offline get a lot more traction and in podcasts, especially are actually very, very performant for a lot of brands. Those are a couple of things that come to mind.

Lenny (00:59:11):
Those are great. Happy to hear the podcast piece. Excellent. And then I actually, I'm an investor in a startup that Databig at a home campaign and they just told me that it was a 10 to one positive ROI on the deals that they got out of it. So I've been seeing that too, and that's such a good point that the measurement and attribution online has come down where it maybe makes more sense to try stuff like that. Amazing. All right. Are you ready for our very exciting lightning round? I'm going to ask you five questions I think, and then just, yeah, let's go through it quick.

Yuriy Timen (00:59:44):
Let's do it.

Lenny (00:59:45):
Let's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Yuriy Timen (00:59:50):
Ooh, that's something that I think is very wrong to recency bias, right? It's like, what are some of the books you've read recently that you've enjoyed? But I would say there are a couple of books that stuck with me over the years. I think on the business side, where on the business side productivity side, it's a book called Essentialism. I forget the author's name. I think his last name is McKeown or something. And it's basically the book about cutting out the noise and finding a singular focus and doing that really well. It's a book that was a game changer for me at Grammarly being sort of new in my career, having really aggressive goals, not being scared to say no. Taking on a lot, just feel it thinking like, "Well, I'm only working 12 hours a day. There's 12 more left. I can do it."

Yuriy Timen (01:00:45):
And then when you end up stepping into a leadership role, which happened for me, I mean, that happened prior to grounded, but really I was able to grow into that role at Grammarly. That book was incredible and I used it a lot. I pretty much got copies for everybody on the team, like 40 plus people. So that is a book I swear by.

Yuriy Timen (01:01:06):
I read a lot outside of work and business. So I don't know if it's appropriate, but I'll say that. It's Frankl's, A Man's Search for Meaning is just a remarkable memoir on perseverance and I think that biggest takeaway is you can't control what's happening around you, but you can control your reaction to it. And then I'd say the book that I read recently, because I was very affected by the Russia invasion of Ukraine. I'm originally from Ukraine. I believe you are as well. So it hit very close to home and there have been a lot of references drawn between the President's Zelensky and his response in the war and Winston Churchill's response in 1941 when Hitler started marching through Europe. And so I read a book called I think The Splendid and the Vile by Eric Larson.

Lenny (01:02:02):
Yeah. I read that. I read that.

Yuriy Timen (01:02:03):
Did you also read it since the invasion?

Lenny (01:02:06):
No, it was before that, but I totally get that now.

Yuriy Timen (01:02:09):
Reading it right now because I've been following the conflict very closely, but for people who haven't followed the conflict or maybe have only followed the rush, the war kind of in a cursory way, you can put what's happening into historical context remarkably well. So I feel like that book accomplishes two things. Number one, it's like you learned something about not so distant history that maybe you didn't know, which was about Great Britain and Winston Churchill kind of courageous response in the face of Hitler's invasion of Europe. But you also can draw so many parallels to what's happening today. And hopefully that helps us understand what's at stake, not to end on two grandiose of a note.

Lenny (01:02:57):
We'll go less grandiose quickly, but I will add one thing that stood out in that book that is also true in the Ukraine is how during the fire bombing of Britain, people are just going out every day, going to clubs, still having-

Yuriy Timen (01:03:09):
I know. Steal them their life.

Lenny (01:03:11):
And same thing even today in Ukraine is.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:14):
And not just keep, but it's very life.

Lenny (01:03:17):
I love that. Okay. We'll move on to less, less serious stuff maybe. What a transition to, what's your favorite other podcast?

Yuriy Timen (01:03:27):
Honestly, there's only one other podcast that I'll listen to right now because I've just been so consumed. I listened to a lot of live streams and read a lot about the conflict, which has taken up so much of my head space. That's not work related, but I would say that the All in Pod. I feel like it's a cool way for me to just catch up on everything that's going on through their unique filter.

Lenny (01:03:50):
Yeah.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:50):
That's probably the-

Lenny (01:03:52):
Cool. Yeah. I learned a lot.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:53):
I learned a lot from that one. That's so much drama on that show. Okay. Great. Favorite recent movie or TV show. Anything stand out.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:00):
So that's another thing. Since February I've watched nothing. My Netflix skew just keeps growing because they keep emailing me saying this new season is out. I'm like, "Oh yeah. I used to that show. Let me add it to the queue." I mean, recently I had some downtime. The kids were with grandma, so I watch movie Hustle with Adam Sandler.

Lenny (01:04:22):
Love that. So good.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:23):
Yeah. It was good. It was it's very light. It's not like a movie that's going to make you think a lot, but it was just good old entertainment. Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:31):
I like that. I like that summary. Yeah, it was so delightful. Maybe one more question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader? Maybe someone people may not know or if anyone else comes to mind.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:43):
That's a very good question. So I would say first off, I do believe that some of the brightest minds, honestly, in any craft are people that you never hear because it takes a certain personality, energy, and probably a lot of other circumstances to invest in your personal brand. And also it's very hard to do that while still staying relevant as a practitioner. I mean, when I think about myself two years ago before starting advising, I was just kind of living in my Grammarly cave. And I felt like I was probably at the top of my craft, but I didn't have time to pick my head up or not, maybe not even just tie, but I didn't know where to start to pick my head up and do something like this. I would say some people that, I mean, I mentioned Ethan in terms of SEO. SEO and just organic growth loops and content as a growth engine, he is best in class.

Yuriy Timen (01:05:49):
Who else? So Mark Fisk, he shows up in the Reforge chats a lot. He was leading growth and marketing at Credit Karma for a while. And right now he's an investor I think at the HRG Capital, but he is a really, really strong thought leader on all things, performance marketing attribution, and just kind of paid acquisition at large. Those are two people that I make sure I... And there are others of course, but those are two who I make sure I stay in touch with at least on a quarterly basis because any casual catch up just yield so many unique nuggets.

Lenny (01:06:25):
Amazing. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuriy Timen (01:06:31):
Honestly, I don't have a very strong online presence. I would say LinkedIn is probably the only place where I seek things the recent, so folks can find me there. They can also find me inside of Lenny's Newsletter. I do. I do. I do, but you can appearance there once in a while and on that's odd.

Lenny (01:06:53):
True.

Yuriy Timen (01:06:54):
How folks can be helpful to me, honestly, promote and shout out of Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Pod and that if you're building awesome things, come talk to me. I always carve out some amount of time in my life just for noncommercial things, just to have conversations with founders and spent 30 minutes with them on a phone, expecting nothing in return and maybe save them some time from making some of the mistakes that I've made and help direct them on a more path. So it's about it.

Lenny (01:07:27):
Amazing. You are awesome. Thank you so much for making the time to do this. I learned a ton. I can't wait to get this episode out. There's just so much meat to this thing,

Yuriy Timen (01:07:36):
Dude this was good.

Yuriy Timen (01:07:37):
I feel like my nervousness was unfounded. This was super organic. You are just as welcoming as you are outside of the pod. So yeah. Thanks for having me.

# Lessons from Airtable’s unconventional growth strategy | Zoelle Egner

## Transcript

Zoelle Egner (00:00:00):
There is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:00:35):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
Lenny (00:01:02):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Zoelle Egner. Zoelle was one of the earliest employees at Airtable, where she led their early marketing and customer success teams, and generally just helped Airtable grow into the legendary business that it is today. She also spent time in Box. She's advised dozens of startups on marketing and growth, and is now head of marketing and growth at a startup called Block Party. 
(00:01:32):
In our conversation, Zoelle shares how to punch above your weight as a startup, the most effective and impactful growth and marketing tactics throughout Airtable's history, including their use of billboards, marketing investments that are often high ROI, and those that are rarely a good use of time, why PR and launches are actually useful to startups, and also when they aren't, and a lot more. It was so much fun chatting with Zoelle, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Zoelle Egner after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(00:02:03):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences, from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SMTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like, "Error on line 53." And never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.
(00:03:10):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach, so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

Zoelle Egner (00:04:12):
Hi, thanks for having me.
Lenny (00:04:14):
It's very much my pleasure. Something that is pretty cool is that we actually met in my newsletter Slack community. I actually looked this up of how we actually started chatting, and it was me cold DMing you to get a discount on Airtable for the newsletter subscribers. And you very happily got me that, hooked us up, and then you became a go-to Airtable person for advice on what Airtable did right and wrong over the years. And so thank you for being that person and also I'm really excited to have you on this podcast and to learn from you.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:43):
I am super excited to chat.
Lenny (00:04:45):
Awesome. You're probably best known for your time at Airtable, which, correct me if I'm wrong, you're employee number 11.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:53):
That's right.
Lenny (00:04:55):
Okay, and at Airtable you led marketing, you led the customer success teams, so we're going to chat about all that stuff. But before we get into that, I want to chat briefly about this other project that you worked on, that from the outside felt like a really fascinating thing, and a really impactful project, and a really cool team. And it's called Vaccinate California, I think, is that how you pronounce it?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
Mm-hmm.
Lenny (00:05:13):
See, I just-
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
VaccinateCA.
Lenny (00:05:15):
VaccinateCA. Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about what this was? What were you trying to do? What was the impact you had? How did it all go?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:21):
Yeah, absolutely. So VaccinateCA existed to help people in California find and get a COVID vaccine as quickly as possible, and that sounds really trivial right now, but you have to wind back to January of 2020, when vaccines were first coming out, and it was really hard. So just as a reminder, because most of us have blocked that from our memory. 
Lenny (00:05:40):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:05:41):
The federal and state systems didn't really exist yet, and so everything was this horrible hodgepodge, where eligibility depended on not only what state you were in, it was down to the county, and even sometimes the individual facility. You would be at a Walgreens, and talk to them, and they'd be like, "Oh, you have to be over 65, and also in one of these 12 categories of employment in order to get the vaccine." And then you'd go a mile away and they would tell you something totally different. So people would stand in line for hours. There were phones going off the hook, utterly madness, and really, really scary for a lot of people who were trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe. 
Lenny (00:06:17):
Yeah, I remember those days well.
Zoelle Egner (00:06:19):
Yeah. So this organization was founded essentially by a tweet by Patrick McKenzie, for those of you who are on Hacker News Patio11. And he had basically this really simple premise, which is, "If you call a pharmacist, and you ask them who they can give a vaccine to, and what vaccine they have, and then you put that answer on a map, someone else doesn't have to make the same phone call. And that takes lots of pressure also as a healthcare system and also helps people to match supply and demand." 
(00:06:47):
So surprisingly, somehow, that tweet, which is essentially like, "Call people, put in spreadsheet, put online," turned into an entire, full nonprofit that was mostly on Discord, Zoom, Airtable, and not only had this entire hundreds of volunteers who were making phone calls in the state of California and eventually, actually, nationally, we became Vaccinate The States eventually, we were also doing this thing called web banking. So we would go and scrape all the official sources as they started coming out, and then validate them because they were not always correct. And eventually we had the most comprehensive database and map of locations in the entire country, including more comprehensive than the federal government and most of the states because they had really complicated limitations on what they could and couldn't publish based on some relationships they had. We didn't have those limitations.
(00:07:37):
So it meant that we became this clearing house, essentially, for this information and we built an API. We were working directly with Google. And if you ever looked up vaccine locations on Google Maps, that was us feeding that to them, which was really cool. And we also made maps you could see on county websites, so it would help you understand what was available in your area. One of the coolest things that I've ever worked on.
Lenny (00:08:01):
Okay, exactly. That's exactly I imagined how epic this was. Just to make sure people understand what you're describing, basically you had hundreds of people sitting there on phones calling vaccine locations, getting the specifics of who is able to get a vaccine there, and then just giving people a pointer of where they can get a vaccine.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:18):
Exactly. So I came in initially, a colleague of mine at Airtable had been helping out with the building out of the backend. And they started getting media attention. And they thought, "Oh, well this will help more people understand that this resource is available." So I got brought in to do some PR help, basically help them figure out how to get the word out, and then ended up actually quitting my job at Airtable to work on it full-time.
Lenny (00:08:40):
Oh wow.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:41):
Yeah, I was on the board and also managing all outreach and other stuff. So we did lots of really cool education, helping people understand their eligibility at all. Built a bunch of fun tools for that as well, but it was a pretty incredible six months, where we filled a really critical gap in the infrastructure of the country. 
Lenny (00:08:58):
It's wild that was the best solution, is just call people and create your own. 
Zoelle Egner (00:09:03):
You know?
Lenny (00:09:03):
I imagine there was, at Airtable, were you using to store the data?
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
Oh yes. 
Lenny (00:09:07):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
We built an entire insane database, and then eventually custom software on top of that, to make the people who are making the phone calls more easily get the information in. It was a whole thing. Very cool to see, though, not just tech people get involved. We had, in our volunteer base, people from absolutely every walk of life, not just in California, globally. I remember there was a volunteer who said that he decided to join, he was based in Israel, and he had had no trouble getting the vaccine whatsoever, but seen something on Twitter about it, and just decided he wanted to make sure that people were able to get the vaccine as easily as he did. And he spent dozens of hours calling folks, even though he was in a totally different time zone. But really lovely to see all these different people, retired teachers. I think we had a bunch of 12 year olds who were helping out on the code, of all things, all who just really wanted to make sure that they could keep their community safe.
Lenny (00:10:02):
What happened with this organization? It's a nonprofit that now continues to run or what's happening?
Zoelle Egner (00:10:06):
No, we did something which is not common. We actually decided to shut it down after six months. Partially, that's because the existing system finally caught up. And frankly we didn't want to be in a place where we were pulling away resources that could be put towards other things that are going to be more impactful. We always saw ourselves as a stop gap, and once we got to the place where we felt like we weren't really being additive, we wanted to get people's time back, so they could work on other things. So it doesn't exist anymore. I think you can still go check out the archive. We found some researchers who are doing interesting research on it, because there's very fascinating data in there about the equitability of some of the distribution of the vaccine based on where it was available, but the organization is gone. We had that beautiful moment in time and have all moved on. Hoping we don't have to get the band back together, because hopefully it's not necessary anymore.
Lenny (00:10:58):
Oh, man. I'm watching The Last of Us right now about this-
Zoelle Egner (00:11:02):
Mushroom people.
Lenny (00:11:03):
... mushroom based disease, and that scares me now. 
Zoelle Egner (00:11:06):
Yep.
Lenny (00:11:06):
Anyway, on this podcast I try to get to things people learn from these experiences, and so I have to ask what you learn about forming something like this, just ad hoc, pulling a bunch of people together, and having them focus, and get things done, or just scaling it, or even shutting down. I guess what have you taken away from that experience that you maybe will bring to either future one-off things like this or even just your work in general?
Zoelle Egner (00:11:31):
Yeah, I'd say probably three things. One, the incredible power of a simple idea to bring people together. One of the reasons why VaccinateCA was so powerful and got so many people to help is everybody immediately understood why it would be useful and how they specifically could be making a difference. And combining those two things was an incredible way to bring a lot of people on board very quickly, because from a messaging perspective, messaging, something very important to me as a marketer, it was so concise. Like, "Pick up phone, help save lives." Really straightforward. People really, really got that. It allowed them to feel like they had agency in a time when everything felt really, really out of control. I think there's a lot of opportunities we have to activate our communities and give people that sense of control that are both going to be helpful more broadly for society, but also just for those individuals as well to make them feel a little bit more safe, a little bit more like they can actually have a difference in things. 
(00:12:34):
I think in tech we often don't jump into these problems. This was not sophisticated technology. It was phones, Discord, and Airtable mostly being used like a spreadsheet. It wasn't anything wild. Even that very simple infrastructure was enough to make a huge difference. And we have some evidence that we saved a lot of lives as a result of it, which is pretty special. I think part of it is also just saying, "We don't have to be hesitant to jump into these problems. It's important to engage with experts in the field, is not to say that tech solutionism is always the answer." And again, this is not super sophisticated technology, but because we were able to go in and talk to the people who are actually affected, get into the system that already existed, and make something really simple, really fast, it actually did have a huge difference and that's really exciting.
Lenny (00:13:24):
Just to double-click on that one, actually reminds me, some founders of companies I've invested in, I often hear how much easier it is for companies that have a mission that people are excited about for them to hire versus companies that don't. And so it's a really good reminder of just the power of having a mission and a vision that is really compelling to people versus some B2B software that people aren't [inaudible 00:13:47] excited about, even though there's a great reason to have great B2B software. Love B2Bs.
Zoelle Egner (00:13:50):
There are. I love great B2B software. I've spent most of my career on it. But I agree with you. I think if you have an authentic mission and people aren't just like, "Oh, sure, okay. You're connecting the world." But really it's some telephony startup. Like, "Okay."
Lenny (00:13:50):
Yeah. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:05):
If people feel like it's genuinely authentic to what you're building, it can be incredibly meaningful.
Lenny (00:14:11):
Yeah. I just remember a founder who, he is a second company, because the first company did not have an amazing mission. The second one did. And like, "Wow. So much easier to hire for this new startup."
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:14:20):
So totally get that. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Absolutely. 
Lenny (00:14:22):
Okay, number two and three.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:23):
Number two and three, I'll try and be more brief. 
Lenny (00:14:25):
It's all good.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:26):
Number two, I would say just the importance of relentlessly repeating the exact same stuff over and over again, even if you feel like everyone definitely knows. This is something that I've seen play out in every single leadership role that I've had, but it was never more acute than here, particularly because we had this broad coalition of hundreds of people with very different backgrounds. Some people coming to the meeting, some people not, whatever else. I think I repeated the same three talking points about why what we were doing mattered 5,000 times. Cannot overemphasize how many times I said the same stuff, and so did every other member of the board. It really is important and people will fill in the blanks with totally wild things if you don't continuously have that discipline of repeating yourself. You just have to get used to saying the same stuff. And if you do it correctly, it's super motivating. Even if you're sitting there being like, oh my gosh, "I have to say it again." it's worth it.
Lenny (00:15:22):
This reminds me, I don't know where I saw this, it's just in my head right now, that the CEO and founder's job, their actual title is repeater in chief.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:22):
It absolutely should be.
Lenny (00:15:31):
It resonates. Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:31):
I've worked with some leaders who never wanted to. They're like, "No, this is going to be boring for people." And you just have to be like, "Honestly, most people are never listening as much as you think that they are."
Lenny (00:15:39):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:39):
"We wish that they would. But you have to say it 12 different ways in writing, and out loud, and all this other stuff. You're never as important as you think you are, unfortunately, when it comes to that." 
Lenny (00:15:48):
Oh, these are great lessons. Okay. What else do you tell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:15:51):
I think my last learning was really about the power of having a laughably small MVP for something. By the end of this, we were covering the entire United States. We had an API, we had custom software on the front end, this whole behemoth of stuff that we got to in four months or something. In the beginning it was truly, basically, a spreadsheet, and phones, and that was it. Even that, for the first few weeks while we were getting the rest of the infrastructure really going, not only had tremendous impact at one of the most important parts in the pandemic, but also gave us so much information about we actually needed to build that was going to be helpful. And I remember having all of these assumptions about what was going to be necessary to manage this coalition of people to make sure that we had really good data quality.
(00:16:41):
Because one of the most important things you can do if you're trying to be a trusted source of truth is actually have the correct information. Sounds trivial, it's not at all at that scale. And I was totally wrong about all my assumptions. I thought we were going to have to have totally different types of oversight. I thought we were going to have totally different tooling. And it turned out we could do something way lighter weight that would allow us to move much faster as the regulatory landscape kept changing, as all the rule making at individual places kept changing. And that agility, that willingness to do just the smallest possible thing is obviously a little bit of a trope in the industry. 
(00:17:15):
People talk about it a lot, but it's never been driven home to me so much, because we're talking about something that had incredibly high stakes as people's health, and we're still able to do it in that context. So if we could do it there, you can imagine that the applications of that in other industries are just tremendous. So yeah, if you're listening to this, and you were thinking maybe you needed to add more stuff, I bet you could prune.
Lenny (00:17:39):
And it's nice to have the forcing function where the world is changing so quickly and the team's probably small, where you are forced to build small. Which I think is why this reminder is so important. Oftentimes you have more resources, and you end up building more just because you can. And yeah, what you're saying is oftentimes, "It'll shoot you in the foot."
Zoelle Egner (00:17:55):
Yes.
Lenny (00:17:56):
Amazing. I didn't expect to get into this much detail with VaccinateCA and so I'm glad we did. Let's zoom out a little bit, and just fill in some gaps on your background, briefly. Can you just highlight some of the other wonderful things you've done in career? Airtable, we talked about, VaccinateCA, just broadly, what else have you been up to? 
Zoelle Egner (00:18:13):
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so I'll try and be brief. I worked in tech for more than a decade, mostly marketing and customer success, a little bit of ops. Before I got into tech, I was a little bit of a dilettante, so some non-profit, healthcare, dying big box retail, because I graduated right into the recession and I was certain no one would hire me. Turns out that was actually wrong. But on the plus side, now I know what dysfunction looks like at great scale, which is actually quite an education and very useful. But I always knew I wanted to get into tech, partially because I'm from the Bay area, and partially because I had been obsessively power mapping the industry, and looking at its flocking patterns, and who had what types of influence, because I'm a nerd. And I really wanted to see if I could get in, in the first place. Because- 
Lenny (00:18:59):
Wait, can you talk about this, which, what is it you did? What did you call, a flocking pattern?
Zoelle Egner (00:19:05):
Sure. You can imagine in any community, there are nodes of influence, people who know a lot of folks, they have money, whatever it might be. And they're able to direct how that community or that ecosystem evolves. In the tech industry, typically VCs will often play a role in this, but so will certain types of executives. And you can follow how they move between different companies, and who they worked with, and then see that influences who gets investment in the future. It influences the different partnerships that evolve. It influences the assumed wisdom in various different careers. And because I'm a big old nerd, I was literally drawing diagrams based on-
Lenny (00:19:48):
Whoa.
Zoelle Egner (00:19:48):
... reading people's blog posts of who was influential in what way? Because I was non-technical. I tried programming, and I hated it, frankly. And so I was like, "Okay, it's 2010, it's 2011. There's not clear ways to get into the industry as a non-technical person. I need to figure out how to do this with people. Because otherwise I'm not sure why someone would take a chance on me with what I have done historically. And that sounds a little insane, but it's very effective. And I ended up getting my start in tech basically by identifying a company where I thought I had a unique set of connections or understanding of the space that they were working in, where I thought I could maybe email the CEO and be helpful.
Lenny (00:20:29):
And did this connect to that diagram you drew? Did this help you point in that direction?
Zoelle Egner (00:20:34):
Yeah, absolutely. So I was closely tracking YCombinator and that whole ecosystem. So I knew I wanted to find a smaller company, where they maybe were having more difficulty hiring, because they were less well known or a little bit less, I don't know, sexy. But while they were still connected into that broader group, because it has with a pedigree that people would take you seriously if you had worked at a YC backed startup.
Lenny (00:20:55):
Right.
Zoelle Egner (00:20:55):
Anyway, I got really pointy hat strategic about this, but it was effective. 
Lenny (00:21:00):
Do you still-
Zoelle Egner (00:21:00):
And-
Lenny (00:21:00):
... have this diagram, by the way? It'd be so funny to look at it right now.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
No, I don't think I have it anymore. I might be able to dig it up, but alas, I think it may have been lost in one of my many moves since then. 
Lenny (00:21:03):
All right.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
It's been-
Lenny (00:21:03):
No problem.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
... more than a decade. 
Lenny (00:21:18):
Okay. I imagine that was true. Okay, so I think I cut you off. You were talking about some of the things you've done in your career.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:20):
Yeah, ended up using my studies of the space to get into a role as employee one at a developer focus YC backed startup. And the funny story on that is that I got that role by cold emailing the CEO while I was still in college. And then he actually followed up with me almost immediately, because I'd offered to introduce him to some professors, which was useful for the type of business. And then I ignored him for two years because I got busy with my thesis, and got other jobs, and whatever, came back to it and wrote this ridiculous apology email, being like, "I promise I respond to emails faster. I see that you're hiring. Would you give me a second chance? Please, can I come work for you? I have no experience that's useful, but I work really hard." And I figured he would either laugh me off of the internet or give me a job, and very fortunately for me, he gave me a job. So thanks, Ryan. Appreciate that. That was how I got into tech.
Lenny (00:22:11):
Thanks, Ryan. 
Zoelle Egner (00:22:12):
Yes, we appreciate it. So that startup got acquired by Box. And when I went over to Box, they had never had paying developers before. So we were bringing over seven figure contracts. So I started developer success programs there. And then in a totally wild shift, I ended up moving over to run their social media editorial and internal comms, which doesn't sound related to developer success, but I had always been a writer, and I wrote this blog post about what it was like to be an early stage non-technical employee. There was a little spicy, talking about some of the challenges, and I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it. And I got this email from PR being like, "We need to have a meeting." And I was like, "Oh, they're going to fire me. I went too far." I thought I was being circumspect, that I went too far. And in the meeting they were like, "Hey, we really think you should apply for this job. We would love to have you run social media." Which is not the outcome I expected.
Lenny (00:23:05):
That's a cool learning, there. Just like, "Do stuff." You know? "Don't be afraid."
Zoelle Egner (00:23:08):
Yeah, it was definitely not the expected outcome, but one that was very exciting. So got to go run those programs for a couple years through the IPO, which is a whole education in and of itself, to see how comms changes when you become a public company. And then I was on Hacker News obsessively at the time, and I saw the beta for Airtable come out. Immediately signed up, and became obsessed with the product, and evangelizing it to everybody that I knew and ultimately ended up figuring out a way to finagle my way into that role as employee 11 there. 
(00:23:43):
And it sounds like we're going to talk about Airtable more, so I won't belabor that, but marketing and customer success stuff, ended up leaving for VaccinateCA, and then the last little bit here is just when that ended, I really thought I wanted to start my own company. So I gave myself a certain window in which to try out different ideas, and at the same time was advising and consulting. Ultimately didn't end up finding anything that I felt so much conviction that it was worth blowing up absolutely everything else about my life in order to go heads down on a company. So eventually decided to go in-house with one of the companies I've been advising, Block Party, and now I run marketing and growth there.
Lenny (00:24:19):
Can you just explain Block Party briefly? [inaudible 00:24:21]-
Zoelle Egner (00:24:21):
Absolutely. We're an online safety company. We help users have more control over their digital experience. And our first product is anti-harassment and anti-spam tools for Twitter.
Lenny (00:24:30):
So you've worked at Box, Airtable, now Block Party. You've advised a lot of companies around marketing product growth. I'm curious if there's a thread that has maintained through all of those experiences in terms of what works well for marketing, and growth, and things you've learned that just consistently- [inaudible 00:24:52]
Zoelle Egner (00:24:52):
A few pieces that go into how I choose companies that create that thread. And part of this is about me wanting to match what I think I'm really good at with what will have the greatest leverage for a company that I work at. I've mentioned I'm a writer, really care about telling stories, and helping people to understand new or novel things. I also really care about product quality. I'm a little bit of a product snob. And one of my strengths is enthusiasm. So if I can't genuinely go to a customer and tell them, "This product is going to solve a real problem for you and it's going to be amazing." I can't do my job. So all of the companies that I've chosen to go to have had this foundation of an incredible product experience that maybe people didn't fully understand, and where I could come in and help connect the dots between that amazing product that's going to be really, really helpful and the opportunities for a much wider range of people to benefit from that.
(00:25:46):
So in practice, what that means is I often end up working at companies that are in a position to really punch above their weight from a brand perspective. They're typically much lower headcount than you would ever expect. They're typically way earlier stage than you would expect, but I've been able to put together a brand or an experience that allows people to invest themselves into the company with a high level of trust, I guess. 
(00:26:13):
I'll be more specific because that's really ambiguous. Airtable, it manages mission critical workflows, highly sensitive data. It's super important. You only use tools you can trust for that type of thing. The same thing is true at Block Party, online safety. You have to trust the company that you're entrusting your safety to. And in my experience, people, and especially founders really underestimate how much every single touchpoint a customer has from word of mouth or the ad that brings them in the door, landing pages, signup flows, customer service experiences. Every single one of those moments is building a brand that is adding or removing trust.
(00:26:48):
So for me in the early days, that means thinking about like, "What are the signals that I can provide to future customers that say, 'We understand you specifically, and our solution is designed for a person like you.' And two, that will say, 'Hey, we're actually operating on a much higher level than you might expect for a company of our size or our stage. We take this really seriously. We have all the things in place to take care of you. So you shouldn't be afraid to spend six figures or put your safety in our hands because we've got your back. We're doing this the right way.'" Has tremendous dividends when you're in a business that is often driven by word of mouth. Because if you take care of people and you follow up that brand experience with a product experience that is really powerful and actually does the things that says it's going to do, then your word of mouth can become a huge driver of growth for the company.
(00:27:40):
Of course, the outcome of this in practice is really funny. So I remember really distinctly having to invite customers to go out to lunch with us when they would come to San Francisco back in the Airtable days, because we had 15 people in a teeny tiny office. It's not that I wanted to mislead anyone, but I didn't need to reinforce the fact that they were spending six figures with us when we had 15 people. If they had gone to look on LinkedIn, they could have figured that out, but we didn't need to remind them that we were so small, and they were running some of their most important processes with our product. I think I was on the phone with Slack at one point. And they were like, "Oh, well you guys are probably about the same size company as we are, right?" And I was like, "Not quite. A little smaller, just an entire order of magnitude, no big deal, it's totally fine. We're all smooth. We'll take care of you. It's going to great." But it-
Lenny (00:27:40):
Amazing.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:27):
... really makes a difference, all of those little things.
Lenny (00:28:31):
That reminds me, I heard stories of very early Airbnb days where they had to take meetings in a bathroom, or in the hallway, and they did interviews, I think in the hallway because there was no space.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:41):
We did a lot of calling from the hallway at Airtable, also from this weird internal patio you could only get to through climbing through a window. The window kept breaking. And so I, at one point, remember someone getting stuck outside trying to interview someone with the windows closed. Utter, utter ridiculous nonsense. But you know, that's all the fun things that happened in the early days before you become bigger.
Lenny (00:29:06):
Yeah, I love those early day stories. 
Zoelle Egner (00:29:08):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:29:09):
I really love the concept of punching above your weight as a startup. What else did you do at Air Table or other places that help you do that? One is just don't let them see how small you are, necessarily. Are there any other technical things you recall that like, "Oh, here's things that really worked really well for punching above our weight as a small company at that point."
Zoelle Egner (00:29:29):
A couple of these things are very unsexy, but very useful. One, make sure that your landing pages, and your emails, and other things have a level of polish that makes them feel a little bit more done. I think there is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:30:20):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
(00:30:45):
So those little bits of polish that don't take a ton of time are absolutely worth it. The last thing I would say is making sure that in your public communications launches, if you ever talk to press, which some companies can and some companies can't, having more of a point of view than just about your product, you can try and say, like, "We are part of something bigger. Here's the broader circle or movement that we are a part of." It makes it feel more inevitable and more like you're not just self servingly talking about your tiny corner of the world, but that it's actually part of this much bigger trend. It will be more compelling and it feels like you're operating at a different level of sophistication that can be really helpful.
Lenny (00:31:28):
I love that. On the first point, basically, it's attention to detail and obsession with quality is what I'm hearing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:34):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:31:34):
Just to make it clear, this isn't just a tiny team just pushing the stuff out. I imagine most founders would be like, "Yes, I would love, we are going to focus on quality. We'll make sure everything looks great." In reality it always is this trade off against other things they could be doing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:50):
Yep. 
Lenny (00:31:50):
What do you think folks can do to help keep that level of quality high? Is it just one person being obsessed and just reviewing everything like a founder? Is having someone like you that's just very detail oriented, just review everything? How do you actually execute that when you have 1,000 things to do?
Zoelle Egner (00:32:05):
100%. I'd say there's one of two approaches and you articulated them here. One is you can have the founder that is the avatar of quality, who is just relentlessly being like, "Hey, we're going to do the 15 minute check. Yes, we're going through it. Yes, I'm going to send you a copy of this email, and someone else going to click every link in it, and make sure they're not broken." Or, you can have someone else be the avatar of that who is in the company. I would say in many of the companies I have worked at, that has been me, because I've been the marketing human who cares. But it doesn't have to be a marketing person, it can be someone on product. It can be, honestly, even someone on customer success if you're willing to let them provide their feedback on the way that you're showing up in the world, which you should because they have fantastic insight. There just needs to be someone. 
(00:32:50):
And I think building that into how you interview can be very helpful, as well. So finding people who understand those trade-offs and that balance, and who are willing to put in the extra 15 minutes, but aren't going to spend an extra week trying to obsessively QA everything. You don't want to go that far. Just who has that bent towards detail can be very helpful. Also, just make yourself a checklist. It doesn't have to be complicated. "Every time we put out a blog post, these are the three things we're going to do. Every time we send out an email, it needs to be seen by at least one other person." None of this is rocket science. You just need to make a little process for yourself, and then it can be very fast and lightweight, but the dividends are worth it, I think.
Lenny (00:33:31):
I like how simple this is, just to look like a bigger company, is just pay attention and focus on the little things. It's not a big, whole thing. [inaudible 00:33:39]
Zoelle Egner (00:33:39):
There are some bigger things you can do if you really need to. My favorite silly example of this is Airtable, back in the day, got roasted on Twitter for having billboards that were not super specific about a specific problem or whatever. They were just billboards that we had out. And everyone was like, "This makes no sense. Why are you doing this? We don't understand." They were actually super effective for us because we had a different goal than everyone thought that we did. 
(00:34:03):
For us, it was all about signaling to some very large companies that we were a legitimate and large enough company that they could trust, and we had geographical concentration in specific areas, because we were in the fashion industry, the media industry in New York, we knew exactly where all of their offices were and we knew if they saw our billboards, walking to work, and then got the request to IT for the budget in order to pay six figures for Airtable, they were more likely to be like, "Oh, it's not just some weird startup we never heard of." Like, "Oh, I've seen that billboard, they must be legitimate." And that sounds really silly, but it wasn't actually that expensive.
(00:34:40):
We got mostly remnant inventory, which is at the end of a particular buying cycle. Sometimes they haven't fully sold everything, and you can get the slightly less good ones that are still maybe where you want them for really cheap. And everyone thinks that you only buy billboards if you're huge. So that small signaling thing was a way for us to make sure that we remove some of the risk of not being able to close deals because we were so small. So you can get creative about it. Most of the time you're not going to do that. Most of the time it's like, "Reread your emails." But you could also push it even further if you need to.
Lenny (00:35:12):
What is that full rough cost of billboards like? Because I think people think about billboards and it's hard to even know what they cost. What's a number?
Zoelle Egner (00:35:20):
It really, really depends, so I'm hesitant to give you a number because which metro you're in, it ranges vastly. I would say you can expect that some of that inventory is in the low thousands of dollars, which is way lower than you might expect.
Lenny (00:35:34):
For one billboard.
Zoelle Egner (00:35:36):
Yeah. So you don't need to get a million. And I'm not suggesting you go get one on 101. Good luck to you on that. That's expensive. But you can get one in a reasonable neighborhood in New York for way less money than you might expect, if you're willing to do remnant.

(00:36:41):
Following this thread a bit, my next question is, and this may be the answer, is when you think about Airtable's growth strategy, growth tactics over time, what would you say are one, or two, or three of the most impactful marketing or growth tactics that work best over time? And maybe billboards are one of them.
Zoelle Egner (00:37:02):
I wouldn't say they were the highest ROI, but they're certainly one of the more interesting things that we did. They were useful, don't get me wrong. But I think maybe some other ones are more interesting. The boring answer that I will caveat this with is that one of the pieces of our acquisition playbook, it was very standard, that did work quite well, was some unconventionally targeted Facebook ads. That era is over. So don't expect that that is going to work for your B2B business now because that that's totally changed.
Lenny (00:37:29):
And when you say unconventional, what do you mean?
Zoelle Egner (00:37:31):
We spent a lot of time thinking about a psychographic profile for our users. So the challenge of Airtable is that you can use it for anything. It can be used in every department within an organization. It can be used for personal stuff, you name it, it has a use, because you're functionally building your own software and you can build software for anything. Unfortunately, if you go out to the market with a message of, like, "Build your own software." The vast majority of people are like, "I want to do that. That sounds hard. That sounds stupid. No." 
(00:38:01):
And so we couldn't really use super generic messaging, but to go really specific into verticals, which we did end up ultimately doing, didn't give us the broad coverage to go find new opportunities. You go really deep into one particular vertical or two particular verticals at a time with a small team, but then we weren't surfacing new opportunities that might be even more important. So we tried to balance that vertical specific work that we did with also trying to find this type of person who we had discovered was going to be the best champion for us. 
(00:38:33):
And this is a tinkerer persona, someone who likes new technology, they like putting together the Lego building blocks of things, and you couldn't really find Tinkerer's Magazine. There's not like a place those people hang out. They don't just have one title. It's a psychographic profile as a type of person that could have many, many different roles. And so instead-
Lenny (00:38:56):
And Facebook doesn't let you do that anymore, right?
Zoelle Egner (00:38:59):
No. You can't target based on-
Lenny (00:39:01):
[inaudible 00:39:01] go.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:02):
... like, "They have a tinkerer mentality," unfortunately. 
Lenny (00:39:04):
Okay, got it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
It's so sad. 
Lenny (00:39:05):
Okay. I see-
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
But-
Lenny (00:39:05):
... that it's not possible. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:07):
Yeah. But what you can do is you can say, "That type of person often likes these types of media. We've heard that they often are really into these podcasts, so they're really into reading about this type of personal development." And often that is associated with people who have these broad set of roles but have this typical mentality. So we would find clusters of interests that people might have, that often were shared by those people, and do targeting around that. And then when that worked, they'll look alike based on it.
Lenny (00:39:38):
Did not expect Facebook ads as one of these answers. So that's interesting. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:42):
No, and it's not a good idea anymore. Don't do it now. 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Disclaimer.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:44):
Back in the day, it was great. Now I would not recommend. But I have some unconventional ones that I can suggest that are- 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Get into it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:52):
... not Facebook. There's a few different things, but I want to give some context first for people who are not as familiar with Airtable's business, because I do think these are really helpful pieces of context. The first is because of the types of industries that we are often very successful in, had a very similar network effect that we would see, where basically it was within specific professions, we would see people who, in order to distinguish themselves in that job market, would build a brand around the tools that they used, essentially. We found different ways to accelerate their process of identifying those roles, where it was really, really helpful to build a brand for yourself so that you could hop around to different jobs more quickly, accelerate your process, et cetera, and thus bring along a tool with you and evangelize for it a lot. So that's one set of things we were trying to achieve.
(00:40:46):
The second set of things we were trying to achieve that's also useful context here, is although industry virality was really important for us, even more important was inside of company virality, that was the real superpower of Airtable. We'd go from 10 people to 1,000 people a year. And so we were always looking for ways to make that happen within companies in more and more efficient ways.
(00:41:08):
And then the third piece here is no one had a good generic explanation of Airtable that worked for everybody. This is perhaps partially my fault as marketing, but it's also the fault of the fact that the market was not ready for the good, generic explanation to mean anything, like I mentioned before, people just did not care about the generic explanation. And the magic of Airtable was always seen in its specificity. 
(00:41:32):
So we knew if we can get to the right people and we can connect the dots to them to the correct use case, so they want to go and evangelize to improve their careers, they will do that both externally and within their companies, and more importantly within the companies, they'll be able to go to their friends and say, "Hey, I'm using Airtable as a content calendar, but you have a UX research problem. And I understand Airtable enough that I can help you build a system. And now I'm a superhero internally because I helped you build this whole new thing. Look at me, I'm amazing." And they suddenly have fully done a sales pitch for Airtable without us having to do any work or understand their use case, which is great and very necessary when you are as horizontal as we are. So we had to figure out essentially, "How do we catalyze that word of mouth and build champions at scale?"
(00:42:21):
All of that is to say the two interesting things that we did were all around that. In the very early days, what that meant in practice was we literally had a Slack integration that we pulled in a whole bunch of information about anyone who signed up for Airtable, including their title, the company that they worked at, et cetera. And literally would sit there and had a little button in each of the records that came in that would allow us to email them immediately if we had decided that they might be someone we want to talk to. And we set up this whole automated system so that it would take two seconds to reach out to a ton of different people, being like, "Hey, we'd really love to get your feedback and help make sure you're as successful as possible on Airtable." 
(00:43:02):
This is not scalable in the long term because there's a whole bunch of sending emails and doing meetings. But what it meant is that we were able to start building our mental model for what these champions looked like in practice by finding the patterns across them. And building the foundation is what ultimately became our customer success motion very early. And then we were able to say, "Okay, we found five people who have a content calendar use case with this type of title. And now we'll be able to go run an ad campaign based on that. We can build a bunch of templates based on that. Here's all these different hooks we can use, because we know this is what a champion can look like," in a way that was not going to be obvious if we hadn't talked to a ton of people. So it seems really unobvious as an investment, per se, but tremendous number of human hours going into just having an efficient way to talk to as many people as possible to build those mental models. That's number one.
Lenny (00:43:57):
That is fascinating. Essentially, you weren't even sure who would be excited about Airtable. Part of this is like, "Figure out the personas and groups of people that we believe are the right target to encourage and help support." And then part of that is, "Get it spreading within a company once you figure out these folks within a company." It's such a cool idea to just have a feed of ... I imagine the squad had certain attributes of the person, like, "Here's the company they work. Here's how big it is." And then they talk about, there's a mention of what they're using it for. Is that part of this?
Zoelle Egner (00:44:31):
Ideally. Though we were always very privacy minded, so we couldn't actually get much information about what they were doing in Airtable. We could never see their data, because that would be a tremendous failure of trust, to go back to what we were talking about before. So a lot of this, we would have guesses, and maybe we could see that they'd use certain templates but we didn't otherwise really know. And that was part of the reason why we wanted to talk to them in the first place. 
(00:44:54):
The second reason is that if we could talk to them early, we could help them build their first space, and from there, if they were successful, they would have the tools to go and help other people within their organization. So if we catch them at the beginning, make sure one person was successful by over investing in them, then they essentially became support for everybody else. I should also clarify, these were not necessarily people who were going to be the buyers. The buyers and the champions here look very, very different for Airtable, which is a really an interesting dynamic that many companies do not have. But for us, the person who is going to sit down with a glass of wine on a Friday and build an Airtable base was not the person who had the budget who was going to pay for this thing. 
(00:45:36):
And so we weren't initially looking for buyers, we were looking for champions, in part so that we could then go to IT six months down the line and be like, "Look, you have 500 people using this product, it's been very useful for them. It is time for you to pay now." Not sure IT loved those conversations, but they were really effective for us and meant that it was very, very easy to sell.
Lenny (00:45:57):
Fascinating. It makes me think a lot about the product led sales movement and how this is essentially that, but even earlier, because it's people just signed up and they're just helping them be successful, versus like, "This company's got 14 people using it. You should go try to sell them on an enterprise contract." Essentially this was a tool to help you figure out how to, basically scaling customer success and helping you prioritize who to go after, and being very hands-on with the strongest potential future big buyers.
Zoelle Egner (00:46:24):
Exactly. And I think what's interesting here is it helped us bootstrap two things. One was, to your point, building out the personas, and champions, and so on. And ultimately there's more scalable ways to reach those people in the long run. But secondarily, it also helped us deal with a real product education problem that we had in the early days. Because it was really complicated. Airtable, unfortunately, has two education issues that it needs to solve. It's not just, "How do I put the Lego blocks together?" It is also, "How do I design a piece of software and a workflow?"
(00:47:01):
And unfortunately if you're selling to content marketing manager or a UX researcher, there's no guarantee that they know how to make a workflow. Most software is opinionated, and it does that work for you, and you're like, "It either works for you or it doesn't." And maybe you're frustrated about what it forces you to do in order to work, but you can't really control it, which means when suddenly, you have the ability to create whatever workflow that you want, there's actually some education that needs to go into it in order to be able to make that successful. 
(00:47:28):
It's not enough to just make an Airtable base that's pretty or that functions. You can't get your team to use it effectively if it doesn't fit into the broader context of the organization. It's still going to fail. And so a lot of this was us figuring out, like, "Okay, how do we help these people not only use our product but build something that is going to be durable, so that we do see that growth, so they don't see it as a failure, so it doesn't fail at that second order moment when it starts to get spread out to more people?"
Lenny (00:47:53):
It's a really good tactic for any SaaS product that just is hard to understand and needs, Airtable had both problems. Like, "I don't know what this is for and I don't know exactly how it's going to fit into my workflow." Imagine most-
Zoelle Egner (00:48:05):
But-
Lenny (00:48:05):
... companies still have to deal with both those problems. 
Zoelle Egner (00:48:07):
No, hopefully not. Hopefully not. 
Lenny (00:48:07):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:08):
But once you actually get in with folks, it's very difficult to remove it. So suddenly your retention rates are incredible, your word of mouth is incredible, if you're willing to do that initial work. A lot of people think that Airtable was a pure product led growth company, and missed that huge customer success component that was always very, very important in the early days. And that helped us ultimately move more towards that PLG motion for a while, but was essential to getting it set up in the first place.
Lenny (00:48:35):
Fascinating.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:36):
The other one that we did related to this champions at scale was we spent a hilarious amount of money on really fancy swag. I know this sounds silly, but branded AirPods level of fancy swag. Admittedly more people were in the office back then. Now they are more remote and this would not work as well. But back in the day, if you gave people something really good, not a pen or a sticker, really good, they would show it off to absolutely everyone that they talked to, because they were so excited they got branded AirPods. People would ask about it, walking by their desks. It sounds so like trivial. But for that couple hundred bucks that we spent knowing like, "Hey, this person's already a champion and if someone asks them, they're going to give a really good pitch." Totally worth it. Sometimes better to not skimp on swag. Hard to measure, very effective.
Lenny (00:49:27):
That's a great tip. And it connects to the general idea of find your champions and just do a lot to make sure they're successful, excited, want to evangelize, and an AirPod here and there feel like a really good ROI investment.
Zoelle Egner (00:49:40):
Was for us.
Lenny (00:49:41):
Anything else along those lines?
Zoelle Egner (00:49:42):
I think those are the big ones that I would highlight. The only other small note I would make from a process perspective is if you are going to overinvest in customer success, which I recommend, make sure that you have also set up a process to take the insights that your customer success people are coming up with and turn them into as much content as you can. Because that's where you're going to find scale in the long run. So for us, what that meant was we would talk to a bunch of customers and then customer success would have helped them build bases, and then we would create templates. So were not exact copies, because we're not trying to steal their intellectual property. We would say, "What is the fundamental workflow here, that other companies might have? How do we make a template that is useful from this?" And some blog posts that explain it, whatever else, that we can then put out into the market. 
(00:50:25):
And the next time a smaller company that's not a Fortune 500 wants this sort of thing, someone can just email them that template and we don't have to go through this whole build process, they have something to start with. If you can find those insights and put them genuinely into use as a little conveyor belt, it will be much easier to scale. It will be much easier to come up with genuinely compelling content because it's coming from your customers, so they already care about it. You have strong signal that's going to be valuable if you already built it for them. Use that to your advantage, make that into a little machine. And it makes all of the go-to market that you need to do later easier.
Lenny (00:50:57):
I know that you have the strong opinion that customer success and marketing are basically the same thing and should be maybe one team. Can you speak to that?
Zoelle Egner (00:51:05):
Yeah. This is my spicy opinion, but both of them have to do the same things. They have to identify customer needs. They have to help the customers see your product as a solution to those needs. They need to remove friction from the process of getting value. They are hopefully both encouraging those customers to share with other people, and both of them should be engaged in translating insights from those individuals into resources that can help everybody. 
(00:51:31):
They use different tactics. Marketing is going to use more scalable tactics. Customer success is going to be in the weeds, really talking to individual people, but all of the things they care about are actually the same thing. They just use different ways to do it. And if you, as a marketer, are not pretty confident in being able to say, like, "What I'm doing is getting the right people to get genuine value from this product," so much so that they want to tell other people about it because it's going to make them look good, then maybe figure out if there's ways to bring more of that to your process, because it will make what you are doing more effective.
(00:52:05):
And frankly, there's not a better evangelist than a person whose career you have materially helped to improve based on matching the right person to the solution so that they can have more impact at their company. So much said, one of my unofficial metrics for both marketing and customer success at Airtable, unofficial, was how many people we'd gotten promoted for using the product. I had a running tally of those people, and I knew if we were getting those at the major accounts we were trying to win, something good was happening and we were going to be successful with really large deals.
Lenny (00:52:36):
So curious how you tracked that. I guess you just check in with them occasionally?
Zoelle Egner (00:52:40):
No, I had my CSMs literally, they had really strong relationships. We were actually tracking it. It was a little embarrassing, but it worked really well.
Lenny (00:52:47):
I love it, with the great KPI. It's like dating apps and how many people get married, I guess.
Zoelle Egner (00:52:52):
Exactly. 
Lenny (00:52:53):
Zooming out a little bit, you advise a lot of companies on marketing, customer success, growth, and things like that. Maybe there's a two part question, and see where you want to take it. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:03):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:53:03):
One is just what are activities that marketing, and growth, and customer success teams often do that are impactful and consistently impactful, things that you think startups should invest in that maybe they aren't, or they already aren't and they should definitely keep doing this. And on the flip side, things that don't work, things that maybe they should avoid. So maybe let's start there and there's going to be a followup. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:26):
Cool. Okay. I'm going to start with things to avoid, because I try and not to make too many blanket statements on this, but I have a couple that I am willing to make. So this is all with the caveat that channel market fit is really real, and sometimes these things might work for you. Don't discount just because I say that they don't work for me. There are certain types of flashy event marketing and sponsorships that you will get relentlessly invited to do, that will seem like they're going to be really great for signaling purposes, or for leads, or whatever. 
(00:53:55):
And they're almost always a waste of your time, unless you are in an industry where you desperately need to get to a trade show, because that's where everyone hangs out. At that point, yeah, of course you're going to have to go do that. But if you're in more standard B2B SaaS, or that's not really a thing, there are better ways to get in front of those people than having your logo out there. That doesn't tell them anything. Maybe you get a branded session at the conference or whatever, but who's going to go to that branded session? Probably not that many people. And then you will have spent so much money and gotten nothing for it. Go to the event, do not fund your money on the sponsorship. It's stupid. And then the second one, which is definitely a very spicy opinion, but I'm going to go there. 
Lenny (00:54:40):
Go there. 
Zoelle Egner (00:54:41):
A lot of people think that the epitome of product marketing is creating your own category. And while I agree that it is useful to have strong differentiators, because it is, I think creating a category, getting a new thing in Gartner or whatever, is often a waste of your time. It is a huge lift, absolutely enormous, particularly in B2B SaaS, and I'm not always sure that it's helpful to have your super teeny tiny, little niche over here where you're like, "Oh, we have no competitors." That's not actually how buyers work. It's not really worth it. 
(00:55:21):
That said, there are things you can do that feel like category creation that are actually effective, and that I do think make more sense. And specifically if you can elevate a profession instead of a category, that can make way more sense. So the great example of this is that Gainsight creating customer success or many companies altogether carving out DevOps, or rebranding DevOps, to be a thing that was suddenly a sexy job to have. 
(00:55:47):
And I think that's valuable because a job is an identity and people will fight for an identity. A category of software is a line item on your budget. No one is excited about that. But people are very excited about their job being meaningful, and their job being important, and being taken seriously. And so if you could hold up either an existing or a brand new job and say, "This is really important for much broader business metrics, whatever else. We're going to create community for those people to come together and it's all about the job," and not about you. That can be very powerful and they'll take them with you. You become part of the identity of that career. Amazing. Do that, for sure. But like the Gartner Square, there's some opportunities for that where it makes sense. A lot of the times it doesn't. Don't do that.
Lenny (00:56:34):
Amazing. I love that. Is there more you wanted to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (00:56:34):
No. 
Lenny (00:56:34):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:56:39):
I think that's enough on not to do.
Lenny (00:56:40):
What this reminds me of broadly is just, "Stay focused on the customer and their problems. Don't obsess with who you are, who are you selling to and how will you make their life better." Reminds me of this old idea from Kathy Sierra. Does that ring a bell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:56:55):
Where-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Oh totally. 
Lenny (00:56:56):
... you make your customer a superhero, you want them to feel like a superhero. And if they-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:56):
It works-
Lenny (00:56:59):
... feel like a superhero. And yeah, that sounds like that's essentially what you did with Airtable, a lot of these companies you worked with.
Zoelle Egner (00:57:05):
That that is always the goal. Like, "How can you make them the hero of the story and not you? Because no one cares about your company, what they care about is themselves, frankly."
Lenny (00:57:12):
Are there any products or companies you think of off the top of your head that are really good at this, that are just like they nailed this?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:18):
Yeah, that's a good question. Certainly the two that I mentioned, that helped rebrand some of the professions, so like the Gainsights of the world. I'm blanking a little bit on the ones that have done this for DevOps really effectively, but there's certainly some that have.
Lenny (00:57:32):
Maybe Datadog?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:33):
Yeah, Datadog has done a pretty good job of that. I think where I get excited is when the companies do this in a way that feels less self-serving, or less obviously self-serving. And that means that sometimes you have to be willing to invest in things that will not have super obviously immediate ROI for you, but they will for the community, and for building the community. Oh, actually one really good example, I think Notion has actually done a pretty good job of this. People are really, really invested in the templates that they create, because it feels like you're not pushing Notion, you're pushing the beautiful creation that you have to solve a problem. I think they've done a really nice job on that process, and several of their competitors, I think have done a pretty decent job as well, but they certainly come to mind.
Lenny (00:58:18):
Thinking of templates, I know Airtable, known for templates, and you've mentioned this being a big part of the success, and I imagine a lot of companies now are just creating templates left, because they imagine that's the core, what helped a lot of these companies, Notion being an example. What is your take on the power and importance of templates for software?
Zoelle Egner (00:58:38):
I think they can be tremendously helpful if you are horizontal because they help to narrow the surface area for a user, so they understand how to connect the dots between their problem and your product. And if it is not obvious to someone how they can solve a specific problem, they're going to be like, "Oh, hey, that seems really cool. When I think of something I'll definitely come back." And then you have lost them. And so if you can be like, "Here are three templates that a person you might be excited about." That can be really helpful. Where people sometimes get confused about templates, or have the wrong expectations about templates, is when they think that templates are going to be an acquisition mechanism, and they don't build in the foundation that is necessary for that to be true. So a lot of people think that templates were what drove Airtable's top of funnel. That is not the case. 
(00:59:27):
I was having a conversation with someone who worked a lot on SEO at Airtable in the much later days, and laughing over the fact that people thought that was a big source of traffic, because it was not. We did not optimize them for that. Good luck finding them in search most of the time. Not at all useful. Where they were helpful, narrowing that surface area, helping with matching patterns, helping people understand how the product worked, super helpful. Expansion within companies, tremendously useful. 
(00:59:55):
But they were not a top of funnel mechanism for us, because we didn't put the work in to do that. We did not have an SEO engine. We weren't Zapier. Zapier has done a great job with that. They get a ton of traffic because they built it as a programmatic SEO play, but you have to be clear about what your goals are and what problem they're solving, because otherwise it is very easy to be like, "I'll just build a bunch of templates, and then all of the leads will appear," And that's not going to happen unless you invest in a lot more than at least Airtable did. So it can be useful to build them, know what you're doing it for, and how you're going to measure it, or otherwise you'll waste your time.
Lenny (01:00:29):
Do you think Airtable could have taken advantage of that top of funnel approach if they invested from an SEO perspective or do you think it wasn't an opportunity that worked?
Zoelle Egner (01:00:37):
I think it could have been. We would've needed to hire more humans. Airtable was an incredibly lean team for a very, very long time. From 2015, when I joined, until 2017 or 2018, we had barely 50 people. It was small for many, many years and so we had to make really difficult choices about what to prioritize and what not to prioritize. Should we have hired more people and done more things? I would argue in retrospect, absolutely, yes, there were opportunities that were left on the table, but in early days you leave good opportunities because you have to focus on other things.
Lenny (01:01:13):
Got it. And so a takeaway here is templates could be really useful for customer success versus SEO top of funnel. Right? That's-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:13):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:01:20):
... where they became powerful. 
Zoelle Egner (01:01:21):
Still maybe helpful. Maybe for you, it makes sense to do the SEO play, just know that that is not a small play. It is an investment. It is not and not just like, "Have some people make some templates." You got to do way more than just that. It's not going to be sufficient.
Lenny (01:01:35):
Final potential question, depending on where this goes, and I'm curious how spicy this answer gets, and-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:35):
Oh boy.
Lenny (01:01:40):
It's around launches and PR. You work with a lot of startups, I imagine founders are always trying to plan a launch, get PR. I'm curious your take on the value of investing a bunch of resources in a big launch, the value of just getting PR as an early stage startup.
Zoelle Egner (01:01:56):
Yeah, just getting PR is not a good goal. I know that's been well stated in the market, but just to reiterate it, most of the time PR is not going to get you leads or users, it's just not. And you have to think about when you are creating a launch or doing a piece of PR, what are the breadcrumbs that bring someone back to something that can actually convert? If you have your big tech crunch piece and it's super exciting, it says all these great things about you, and it maybe links to you once, somewhere in the 12th paragraph or whatever, how many people are actually going to click on that link? Not that many people. How many people are going to read that and remember to go Google it? Not as many as you want. Okay? There's going to be so much coming out of the funnel, it is not a useful acquisition mechanism.
(01:02:43):
What it is good for is credibility. And that's where, if you have really clear goals, and you know how you are ready to leverage the asset of a piece of PR coverage, then it can be helpful to you. So the two goals I always recommend to founders when thinking about using PR, are either hiring or maybe improving the response rate for your cold outbound. Those are the two that I think make the most sense, because in both cases they have a different distribution mechanism. In hiring, you're going to include that in an email that you're sending to a candidate. And so it's going to increase the likelihood that they take you seriously, and get excited about the company, and maybe actually end up ultimately joining your team. 
(01:03:22):
Cold outbound, you're using it as credibility to say, "Hey, we're a real company you can trust." Great. Both of those things are all emails that you are proactively sending. You know exactly who they're going to, and you know that asset is going to have, hopefully, the impact that you're looking for, and you can measure whether it makes a difference or not. But just getting a piece of PR, to get a piece of PR is like it'll help with your internal morale, but I'm not sure it's going to do much help for you. So have really clear goals and have realistic goals, or you will be disappointed.
(01:03:51):
Launches however, do not need to just be about PR. In fact, in many cases PR is a distraction, and instead you can have not just one big launch but a series of launches that allow you to stay top of mind, to create momentum with your users, and to show up in lots of different places because audiences respond to novelty, it gives them a reason to care about your company. And so have your big, annual launch or whatever, but also have one two months from then, and another one, and another one. Find ways to use that novelty to your advantage and to get into communities that you think are going to be good fits for your company.
Lenny (01:04:26):
I love that advice. Any final thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Zoelle Egner (01:04:34):
Mostly just all of this is easier if you talk to your customers more. Build a system for yourself that will allow you to have those touchpoints. That's not just making everyone answer customer support tickets, though I do think that is a great idea, because it gives so much empathy and it's really helpful. You as a founder, if you're a founder, or a product manager, or whatever else, should find a way to get that on your calendar weekly or monthly. Go talk to people, it makes it better. You will have a better mental model. The other thing is strongly consider investing in customer success if you are a B2B company, early. Airtable had it before sales, which is a very unconventional approach, but early is worth it. It has huge dividends if you actually listen to them. If you're not going to listen to them, though, don't hire them, because that's sad.
Lenny (01:05:22):
I have followup questions on the customer success piece, say someone wants to invest in customer success, is there a resource, or person, or anything that you could point folks to, to understand and think about how to do this well?
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
There's a lot for people within that profession. There's not as much for founders out there right now, unfortunately. This is an area that I very eagerly am looking for more resources to share with people. Minimally. I'll say, if you care about this, send me a message. I will give you some advice. All of our industry will be better if there are more people working on customer success. So I will help you. Send me a note. Otherwise, I'll try and dig out some other things and maybe you can share them, but there's not a ton. So people in customer success, please share your learnings more with founders. All of us-
Lenny (01:05:36):
Have-
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
... would like to see it.
Lenny (01:06:09):
Yeah, I've actually been looking for someone to write a guest post in the newsletter, about just how to set up a customer success team. And so if you're listening, you think you could be that person. Let me-
Zoelle Egner (01:06:21):
Yeah, I have some people that I will not put on the spot right now, that I will send your way that I think- [inaudible 01:06:26]
Lenny (01:06:26):
Amazing. [inaudible 01:06:27]. Let's make this happen.
Zoelle Egner (01:06:28):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:29):
And then I wanted to ask you a question on the first piece of advice, which is, "Founders talk to the customers more often." Is there one tactical piece of advice you could recommend for how to do that?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:37):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:37):
How to find a customer, how to set it up consistently?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:40):
Totally. The simplest way to do this is to write a template email for yourself that you can send out very easily, that essentially says like, "Hey, thank you so much for using the product. I would really love to hear about your experience so far and get your feedback. Do you have 10 minutes to talk on the phone?" I know it is important that it's on the phone and not a survey because you get way more instinct from unstructured conversation than you're going to get from sending them three things in a Google survey.
(01:07:05):
Set it up, come up with a hypothesis of the type of person that you want to talk to and then run a query against your database, find someone and send three of those emails a week. And it's not exciting, but you can automate most of it and it will be helpful. None of this stuff has to be complicated. You just got to have a system.
Lenny (01:07:23):
Great advice. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:27):
Yes.
Lenny (01:07:27):
I've got six questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, let's see where it goes. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:34):
Okay.
Lenny (01:07:34):
Question number one. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Zoelle Egner (01:07:40):
Okay, I hate this question because I take pride in making highly targeted recommendations, but I will do it anyway. I'm pretty sure you mostly talk to product and growth people. Right now, obviously, AI is a big topic of conversation, so here are two books that will enrich your mental model for artificial intelligence and encourage you to think about it from different perspectives. The first one, a little bit academic, highly recommend it, though. It's a book called Computing Taste by Nick Seaver. 
(01:08:09):
He's a professor of anthropology and he did this study of people and companies who build music recognition algorithms. And it's a really interesting book for a bunch of reasons, including that it's a academic take on both tech culture, and more specifically, the unspoken and underlying assumptions that many workers who are building in this space have. It can be a little spicy and uncomfortable for a person in tech to read, but I think it is a fascinating perspective and very relevant to the stuff that's going on in AI right now. So go check it out. Computing Taste by Nick Seaver.
(01:08:42):
The second is a fiction book, but the Ancillary Justice series by Anne Leckie, about a spaceship AI that ends up separated from its ship and trapped in a body. I'm going to leave it at that. Worth reading for a different way of thinking about AI.
Lenny (01:08:56):
I think we need a Zoelle full episode on book recommendations. These are amazing. Let's keep going.
Zoelle Egner (01:08:56):
So fair.
Lenny (01:09:02):
What other podcast of yours that you love to listen to other than this podcast?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:07):
Probably either Happiness Lab or Gastropod. I love food and also psychology, one of those two.
Lenny (01:09:13):
Interesting. Okay, we'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:17):
Movie, Everything Everywhere All at Once. And TV show, there's a Korean drama called Extraordinary Attorney Woo. That, I really enjoyed.
Lenny (01:09:26):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:29):
Yeah. Okay, so this one is related to customer success. It's my favorite question of all. People hate it, sorry. But I like to ask anyone who's going to be in a customer facing role, who needs to be able to keep their cool, and also learn stuff on the fly, and respond to customers, to solve an unfamiliar problem using Zapier. And they can use the internet to look things up, whatever, but I basically lay out for them a problem that I, as the customer want to solve, and have them build it for me live. This both is surprising for most people, so you get to see how they respond to an unfamiliar situation, which every client will give you at some point, and it shows how they learn things in a very concrete way, which is really interesting. So check it out. It works really well for customer success.
Lenny (01:10:10):
I've not heard that one before. Fascinating. Top five SaaS products that you enjoy and an Airtable cannot be one?
Zoelle Egner (01:10:18):
Ugh. Okay, then I'll try and avoid any company that I have worked for. I really like using Figma. It's nice when designers let me play with things. I've been really enjoying working with Webflow, also means that I can do stuff on my own. This is maybe spicy, but I actually love Google Docs. I'm not a Notion's fan stand, sorry.
Lenny (01:10:18):
Hey.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
But Google Docs-
Lenny (01:10:37):
Can't [inaudible 01:10:37] them all.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
... is like my best friend.
Lenny (01:10:37):
Google Docs is great.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:38):
Yeah. And then there is a personal CRM company that I invested in, so sorry, maybe this is not allowed, but called Clay, and it is the only way I've ever been able to keep track of my-
Lenny (01:10:47):
Wow. [inaudible 01:10:47]-
Zoelle Egner (01:10:47):
... relationships in a real way.
Lenny (01:10:48):
Clay's great product.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:49):
They're the best. And then I don't know if I love it, but I use Zoom so much that I feel like I must say it, because I spend so much of my time on it and it's categorically better than Google Meet.
Lenny (01:11:01):
Final question, favorite book, course, article, any resource on marketing that non marketers can learn from?
Zoelle Egner (01:11:10):
Okay, it's a newsletter. Does that work?
Lenny (01:11:12):
Absolutely.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:13):
Amazing. Okay, so there is a specialist VC firm called MKT1. It's run by Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich, sorry if I pronounced your last name, there, wrong, Kathleen. It's all about marketing. They are marketing experts and operators who now invest, but they make the best frameworks that you can immediately apply. And there's templates and all sorts of super, super tactical stuff, which a lot of tactical marketing content is terrible because it's actually content marketing for some bad platform. Theirs is not. It is genuinely good. Go check it out. 
Lenny (01:11:43):
A huge fan. Emily has been on the podcast. 
Zoelle Egner (01:11:45):
Oh, [inaudible 01:11:47].
Lenny (01:11:47):
Yeah. And I look at that newsletter as the Lenny's newsletter of marketing, and it's exactly how you described.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:53):
It's the best.
Lenny (01:11:53):
Huge fan. Great recommendation. With that, Zoelle, thank you so much for being here. This was a lot of fun. And we got through a lot of stuff, which makes me really happy. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:09):
I am on Twitter @Zoelle. I'm also on LinkedIn, so I live there, come find me there. Otherwise, how can you be useful to me? Mostly like go forth and believe in customer success, and talk to your users, number one, because I am an avid user of technology, and I want it all to be better. Number two, no, that's all I got. Just go do those things and I will be so happy. Also, if you want to talk about customer success, anytime, hit me up. I'm here.
Lenny (01:12:35):
I'm going to add a couple more things, which you mentioned to me offline, that you're hiring at Block Party.
Zoelle Egner (01:12:39):
Yes.
Lenny (01:12:39):
You're hiring growth people, PMs, engineers, and then you're also advising on the side with marketing customer success. Anything else you want to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:48):
Yeah, absolutely. Love advising early stage companies. I'm especially helpful for pre seed and seed, usually, anything PLG, positioning, messaging, figuring out your channels, experimentation, all that early, fun stuff. I love it. Happy to help anytime. And we are hiring across all of the teams, but especially mine. So if you would like to come and do all sorts of fun experimentation, and also help keep people online safe, come look up, Block Party. I'd love to have you on my team. 
Lenny (01:13:18):
Blockparty.com, or where do folks- [inaudible 01:13:19]
Zoelle Egner (01:13:18):
Blockpartyapp.com. Did not-
Lenny (01:13:18):
App.com
Zoelle Egner (01:13:19):
... get blockparty.com. 
Lenny (01:13:19):
You didn't. Zoelle, thank you. Very good.
