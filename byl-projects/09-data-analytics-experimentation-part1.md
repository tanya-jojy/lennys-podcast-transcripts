# Brian Chesky’s new playbook

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today. Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00:00):
Every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

Lenny (00:00:41):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Casey Winters. Casey was one of the first ever guests on the podcast, and the first to make a return appearance. He's a legend in the growth and product community, having worked with or advised companies like Pinterest, Reddit, Canva, Airbnb, Tinder, Thumbtack, Grubhub, and many more. He recently led product at Eventbrite for just about three years, and recently returned to full-time advising, and he's exploring new opportunities.

(00:01:17):
In our chat, we cover something he calls the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager and how to avoid that, what he's found works best when interviewing product managers, what impact he expects from GPT-4 on the role of product management, when to trust your instincts versus your team's insights and instincts, what are all the different kinds of network effects, and how do you effectively leverage them? Plus a great story about what Grubhub missed that let DoorDash and Uber eat their lunch. I always learn so much from chatting with Casey, and I am 100% sure you will learn a lot from this episode. With that, I bring you Casey Winters, after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but if there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack, this leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. 

(00:02:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. 

(00:03:37):
Casey, welcome back to the podcast.

Casey Winters (00:03:39):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:41):
You are the first ever return guest to my podcast. How does that feel?

Casey Winters (00:03:46):
I feel honored, perhaps a bit unworthy, but I'll go with it.

Lenny (00:03:52):
Well, you're both worthy and I'm honored as well. Thanks for joining me again. I have a lot of stuff that I want to chat about, but first of all, I'm just curious, what are you up to these days? I know you left Eventbrite as CPO, I know you're doing a few advisorships with startups, but how are you spending your days, and what do you think is next for Casey Winters?

Casey Winters (00:04:10):
I'm still spending some time with Whatnot and Eventbrite as  advisors. I stepped back from the CPO of Eventbrite in October, but still working on some long-term marketplace strategy stuff, some growth strategy stuff. I'm on the board of a company called Beek, which is like Netflix for audio in Latin America, and I'm doing some angel investing in marketplaces in what I call tech debt as a service, which is what are startups that are building out things that were hard for my teams in the past to build or maintain inside previous companies? The other thing I'm working on is revamping the product strategy program for Reforge. I got some things keeping me busy, but definitely not as busy as I was last year.

Lenny (00:04:53):
This is like a rare, free agent Case Winters time. Should people reach out if they're interested in maybe working with you? What's your advice for people listening?

Casey Winters (00:05:00):
Yeah. I always love seeing how I can help companies. Everyone should err on the side of reaching out and seeing if I have time to help, if there's something they think I can help with. I love talking to startups, so yeah, absolutely. I can't promise anything, but yeah, I just love talking to people about this stuff.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Awesome. We'll point people to how to get in touch with you at the end of the episode, and it'll be in the show notes too. Talking about the CPO role, you're at Eventbrite. You're a CPO. It reminds me of a post you wrote about how hard the CPO role is. There's some quotes that I recall in your post about how, one, if you ever ask a CPO, chief product officer how they're doing, no one's ever going to say, "I'm crushing it right now."

Casey Winters (00:05:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:05:41):
Then there's this other quote about how you basically, as a CPO, just try to put some points on the board before you inevitably get fired. Why is that? Why do you find that, and do you still believe that to be true after leaving that role? 

Casey Winters (00:05:53):
Yeah, I would say I still believe those things I said. It was funny. A product leader who will remain nameless emailed me when I hit year three at Eventbrite, and they said, "Congrats. You didn't get fired after two years. What's your secret?" I think it's very hard to keep product-market fit as a CPO within a company for a long time. The needs of the business shift over time, and of course, we all have different strengths and weaknesses in our game. No one's perfect at everything. In general, as an executive, it's just impossible to do everything perfectly, and any little misstep, mistake, or something you just missed can blow up in a major way. 

(00:06:33):
Frequently, CEOs have visions that can change and get misaligned with the product leader. Also, with leadership roles, you don't get put on a PIP. If a CEO loses confidence, it's over immediately. Nothing like that happened at Eventbrite. I started to see that the areas of leverage for a product leader were just less in my wheelhouse over time. I just talked to my boss about it, and we worked out something where I continue to advise on the things that I'm uniquely good at, and find other people who are better at some of these other things that were maybe more important at the time.

(00:07:09):
Yeah, I'd say it's a really hard role, or a really challenging role. It can be a lot of fun. I learned a lot from doing it, but yeah, I still believe, and I think I've still yet to hear someone say they've really crushed it. 

Lenny (00:07:26):
Is there anything that you learned from that experience to have survived in that role for three years? I imagine you have a lot of skills and you were very valuable to the company, but I don't know, for someone in that's role maybe right now, just like, "Here's something that I did that maybe you should do." 

Casey Winters (00:07:40):
The first one I can think of is a big change from being a product leader to a CPO or something equivalent is you're actually a company exec first and a product exec second. I think some mistakes I made early that I corrected successfully is you want to show that you are caring and paying attention to the overall business first before just taking care of your own product designers, product managers, researchers, whoever. That's advice I found myself doling out to other product leaders a lot more now that I've gone through it. You have to not only truly care, but create the perception that you care about sales, about marketing, about legal, et cetera. Because first and foremost, you're expected to lead the business at that level, so I think that's something that I think is really important.

(00:08:35):
I think something else is really trying to diagnose, without as much bias as possible, where are the strengths and weaknesses of your team? Where are the strengths and weaknesses of your product? Lay that out with your peers and say, "Here's where we are. Here's where I think we need to go. Here's the timeline on which I'm going to work to get us there." Because I think product's such a confusing discipline for people who aren't in it, like a sales leader, many CEOs, a marketing leader, that they don't necessarily know what great looks like. 

(00:09:14):
The things they know about great leadership, they don't know if you know those things, so you have to make it really clear, "Yeah, I know our OKRs are not as quantitative as they should be yet. That's because this team isn't ready for X, Y, and Z. This is where we're going to get them to, but it's going to take some time." One of the things we did at Eventbrite that I thought was really helpful is, when you go public, you tend to rotate over your executive team and get public company execs versus startup execs. A few of us were new, and it's just like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive on product. Let's do a deep dive on customer support. Where's it at right now? What do you feel like your job is? What do you feel like are the issues you're facing? Where do you want to take it over the next three to five years? Then, let's talk about it."

(00:09:57):
Just forcing you to write it all down is really helpful, but then it forces you to explain it. It helps the rest of the executive team get better company execs because now they really understand product a lot more deeply, or understand finance a lot more deeply, whatever the function is.  

Lenny (00:10:15):
Speaking of gaps and opportunities for people in the company to level up, you've been highlighting this trend that I thought was really interesting, something you call the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager. Can you talk about what that is and what you've been noticing?

Casey Winters (00:10:33):
Yeah, sure thing. This is something I started noticing while managing PMs and product designers at Eventbrite, and it's now coming up with Whatnot as I help them hire new PMs, is the environment in which a lot of product managers have come up is very distorted from when you and I started doing this kind of work. I think we used to always describe PMs as this gang of misfits. We all started in all different functions. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, and the PM team gained as a whole from that diversity of skills and previous experiences.

(00:11:12):
What I noticed is, when we started doing product reviews at Eventbrite, if there was any sort of uncertainty in a problem or a solution, the product manager, instead of shipping to learn, would talk about all this research they have to do to really learn the problems, really learn the solution. 

(00:11:30):
My feedback would be like, no, user research is a scarce resource. We have to reserve it for the areas that have extreme uncertainty and high leverage for getting to certain, so if you're redesigning the login page for Eventbrite, you don't need to use that resource to learn what to do. Just go see what FANG and the top unicorns did. They probably did a good job, and even if they didn't, all of our customers also use those products, so they're going to be familiar with us copying any approach that they've taken.

(00:12:05):
I think we sort of forgot in the industry that many times, the fastest way to learn is to ship, so that if you actually get them to skip research and just go look at competitors, another thing I was noticing is I'd get a list of options other companies have done, but there would be no analysis of why those companies chose different options and what's most applicable for us. 

(00:12:31):
It got me thinking, okay, every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

(00:13:10):
At one point, I got so fed up, I wrote an internal blog post, and I called it On Best Practices and Breakfast Rituals. I talked about how there were these articles about the morning habits of the most successful people, and if you try to do all those things, it'd take you like six hours every morning. There was this article, I think it was on Business Insider or something, about this futurist at Google. He talked about all the pills and food he eats for breakfast every morning to try to live longer. The reporter estimated that it cost him one million a year to have these habits, so I was like, "Hey, I want to make it clear. At Eventbrite, we don't have that much money. We don't have that much time. There's no framework that allows you to not use your brain at this company and just follow some sort of process for success in this profession."

(00:14:02):
I adopted this thing into a public blog post that's on my blog now, but now that I've had some time outside of Eventbrite, I feel like I at least partially missed the mark on what's really going on. I see this with Whatnot, because one of the things I'm helping them with is interviewing, I see PMs again, which I haven't done in a while. It's fascinating interviewing a PM or managers early in their career because Whatnot is a startup, and you know better than most of us as a former founder of one, startups typically require us to wear lots of hats. You have to write SQL. You have to talk directly to customers. You have to prep marketing and sales. Most importantly, you have to make a lot of decisions under uncertainty, which you wouldn't necessarily expect a PM to do at, say, a Google, but it all boils down to using your brain in different ways.

(00:14:54):
Lisa, who's on our legal team, she called Eventbrite a public startup because the pandemic basically erased her business and we had to build it back from scratch. Now that I'm doing these interviews, and whether they come from a small startup, a unicorn, or a public company, they all sort of look the same because there's been so much funding to all these companies. Every company's been acting like they're Google with Google margins, meaning a lot of engineering support, a lot of design support, a lot of research support, lots of analysts around them.

(00:15:22):
They actually seem pretty ill-prepared for a real startup, or even a public company with some uncertainty around it like Eventbrite, so you start getting these weird responses in the interview process. You ask them to solve a problem and they'd say things like, "I can't even begin to come up with solutions until I see all the data and talk to customers." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that's something you would normally do if you took the job, but you don't have the data. You can't talk to customers. Make a decision now. What would you do? I want to see how creative you are. I want to see how much you're intuiting about the real problem and solution," and they can't really answer. 

(00:15:56):
Then my follow-up, which I don't ask, but what I really want to ask is like, "When's the last time you used your brain versus followed a process someone else designed at your company?" Because I want the former, not the latter.

Lenny (00:16:09):
Wow. Amazing. There's a lot of things I want to dig into here. I was going to ask why you call it zero interest rate phenomenon, but I think what I'm hearing is it's when interest rates are zero, everyone's got a lot of money, things are going great. Everyone looks like they're killing it, successful. Everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, and then when that goes away, it's like, "Oh, shit. Maybe not so." 

Casey Winters (00:16:27):
Then also, I think zero interest rates allowed every startup to operate like it was a public company with billions of dollars. That's going to go away over the next five years, and it sort of takes us back to what product management used to be like, which was you didn't have all these resources around. You didn't have all this time to figure it out because if you don't figure it out now and make it work, you may run out of funding, right?

Lenny (00:16:51):
Yeah. Like a very concrete thing that's changed as a lot of research teams have been laid off because they grew really large and companies found, "Maybe we need don't need the ..." Like, "Of all the things we can cut, it's probably an area we can cut." 

Casey Winters (00:17:02):
Yeah, for sure. 

Lenny (00:17:04):
There's probably PMs listening to this wondering, "Shoot, am I one of these? Am I just following a bunch of frameworks?" What's your advice for someone that may fear that, "Oh, shoot. This is maybe who I am and I don't want to necessarily be this"? What could they maybe do?

Casey Winters (00:17:17):
I always advise going to companies where you can learn quickly and try things. I think it's certainly okay to learn a bunch of frameworks. There's a reason I've invested a ton of time in Reforge because I think it actually really does help people to see how other people build things in a way that they can scale it to their other companies, but you have to understand that the job is not to follow the process. The job is not to learn every framework possible. The job is to figure out how to add value to customers that translates into value to the business. Just reorient your North Star, if you've gotten away from that.

(00:17:53):
When I joined Eventbrite, there was this team that didn't ship anything in a quarter. I went to the designer who I knew, and I know that he likes to get stuff out there and likes to get feedback. I was like, "Dude, you didn't ship anything. How could you have gone the entire quarter, not shipped any of your designs and felt that that was okay? If you didn't feel it was okay, why did you censor yourself? Come to me. Tell me why this team is not letting you ship. There's just no way you can get better as a designer. There's no way you can have the impact on the company. There's no way you can have an impact on our users." Those are some things that come to mind to that question.

Lenny (00:18:36):
If you're a PM on a team that maybe isn't shipping, maybe is overusing research, do you have any advice of just like when it makes sense to invest in research? Say you have the resources, is there a rule of thumb you have of like, "Okay. Let's actually spend the time on this verse not"? 

Casey Winters (00:18:51):
I think about it a little bit, depending on the type of job you have and the types of customers you have. The more scale you have tends to be you have less sophisticated customers because you're generally like a consumer thing where the customers are rational. They're not experts. That's generally where you just try things. You measure the impact they have, and you only really bring in USEARCH, research when the impact seems confusing, but you can run experiments. You can get data really easily, so bias towards getting stuff out there and seeing what users respond to.

Lenny (00:19:30):
In consumer product.

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:31):
Interesting. 

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
If you're super enterprise, it's the opposite. Each customer, first off, is sophisticated and tend to be rational. They're paying you like six figures or more, and you could talk to the customers and sales, who knows the customers really well directly, and they tell you want they want. They tell you what they're willing to pay for. You build it. They pay you. Bing, bang, boom. It's not, obviously, as simple as that, but you're basically doing the research directly with the customer and with the sales team, and translating that into things that are strategic to the business.

(00:20:02):
I would say those are the two extremes probably most people are familiar with, but we now have a lot of companies in the middle, where they have more customers. Those customers are more sophisticated. They're consumers. They're maybe employees at companies, or they're small businesses. That's where you have to be more nuanced. This, of course, is where Eventbrite was on, "Hey, when do I really lean in on research? When do I lean in on data? When do I pay attention to internal feedback?

(00:20:29):
" For Eventbrite, we really tried to focus research on the B2B side of Eventbrite, where the problems seemed big, but not well-defined enough. Or that problem's well-defined, but we just really don't feel like we have the right solution yet. If research is going to be a scarce resource inside the company, which I think it will in most places, you have to figure out where it's a high-leverage area, which means either really big problem, we don't understand it well enough, or we know the problem's big. We understand it well, but we're just not sure if our solution's going to, in any way, hit the mark. 

Lenny (00:21:06):
Makes me think about some of the best researchers I've worked with, and they often tell me like, "We don't need to do research on this. We have enough information. We have other things we should be doing."

Casey Winters (00:21:13):
I love it when they say that. Yes.

Lenny (00:21:15):
Yeah. This would have been a really good segue to another topic I want to talk about, which is around gut instincts versus team expertise, which we're going to get to, but I have a couple more questions along these lines. 

Casey Winters (00:21:24):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:21:25):
You talked about interviewing PMs at Whatnot. Can you actually describe Whatnot? Just because you mentioned it a couple times, just so people know what we're talking about here.

Casey Winters (00:21:33):
Oh, sure. Whatnot's a livestreaming marketplace, mostly focused on the collectibles market. Sellers, whether it's like baseball cards, or women's handbags, or sneakers, they'll go live on video and show you the products they have that they're selling. People that are watching the stream can engage with the sellers and bid on different items, so kind of like Twitch meets eBay would be a good way to describe it. 

Lenny (00:21:54):
Awesome, awesome. I'll just mention, I'm a tiny angel investor in that company. 

Casey Winters (00:21:56):
Oh, that's why you brought it up. Okay, I get it.

Lenny (00:22:00):
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what this word was because it's like a fun word, Whatnot. What I wanted to actually get to is you said you were interviewing a lot of project managers for them.

Casey Winters (00:22:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:09):
What is your approach to interviewing PMs? What do you find is a really good signal for someone that's going to be successful?

Casey Winters (00:22:14):
I feel like the whole thing's gotten so performative. It's like interviewing is handing out Oscars based on who's prepared the best tell me about a time response, versus actually assessing who can do the job we're hiring for. It's like most PMs are better PM interviewers than PMs now. There's this quote from a movie called The Way of the Gun. I don't know if you've ever seen it.

Lenny (00:22:35):
No.

Casey Winters (00:22:36):
Benicio del Toro says in it, it's like, "These days, they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime." I think about that quote a lot when it comes to interviewing. I would say I'm a bit contrarian here in my approach. I don't ask about your work history. I don't care about your perfectly practiced answers. I'm going to give you real scenarios that I expect from the role. I want to hear how you'd approach them. If you can't come up with a few reasonable ideas, figure out how to test them quickly without analyst support or research, I'm just not interested.

(00:23:10):
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. Interviewing is a very lossy format, but the more I can see them do the job we're hiring for with questions, whether it's a presentation, a prompt, that gets me the most comfortable that they know the job they're signing up for, that they've shown in a practice scenario they can do it, and they actually enjoyed it in some way.

Lenny (00:23:29):
Are there red flags you look for in these interviews? One is maybe you said of like, "I can't even begin to answer this without research and data." Is there anything else?

Casey Winters (00:23:36):
Some things I pay attention to is if they're talking about solutions that are going to take a long time to get signal from, whether it's months and months of engineering time before you actually see the impact on users or the business, I think that's always great. If they're not factoring in the amount of time it will take, in general, is not a good sign, and not thinking a bit more holistically about the types of metrics they expect to improve versus track to make sure they haven't gone down. Those are some things that I pay a lot of attention to.

Lenny (00:24:11):
How much do you think they're intimidated by being interviewed by Casey Winters? How much do you think that factors in?

Casey Winters (00:24:16):
I think you overestimate my importance or awareness in the community. I think most people have no idea who I am when they start talking to me.

Lenny (00:24:25):
Mm-hmm. [inaudible 00:24:25] Another thought is there's this meme that GBT-4, or 5, or 6, or 10 is going to replace product managers, and anytime some new feature comes out, people will put out these videos of, "Oh, look. They're doing all the PM's jobs." What's your take on the future of PM in AI, if any?

Casey Winters (00:24:41):
Well, I think if you thought the PM job was just filling in the latest Reforge or Shreyas framework, and then getting that automatic FANG promotion every year and a half, then yeah, you're going to get replaced by AI. I think the real PM job is the least likely to get replaced over time because you need real subject matter expertise. You need to be trading off a lot of different types of things, and making good decisions for the company and for your customers. 

(00:25:10):
In terms of using AI now as a PM, I'd actually be cautious in the current iteration of the cycle for PMs. It's a tool that's trained on sounding smart rather than always necessarily being smart. I was at Eventbrite the other day, and someone was telling me how they were loving the new Notion AI integration. She asked me if I used it. I said, "No." She's like, "Ah, you totally need to. Hey, go ask it your bio. It's really cool." I said, "All right. Let's just do it on your screen," so she did and my bio said I started my career at Google, and worked on Google Trends, and a bunch of other products, none of which happened. It was just complete nonsense.

(00:25:52):
It did have some stuff that did happen. It knew I worked at Eventbrite, and it knew I worked at Pinterest and stuff, but half of it was just completely made up. It sounded plausible, but it wasn't actually true. I think where I'm more inclined for PMs to try to get leverage out of something like GPT-4 is a lot of the tedious work that's maybe not their specialty to begin with. If you're not great at Excel or Google Sheets and you need to model something, you can ask it to format something. That'll probably be perfect, or how to get some Zapier integration to work. It probably knows how to do that really well.

(00:26:28):
I think, at this point, it's a pretty good no-code to low-code tool. It's obviously going to become a lot more than that, but for a lot of these other use cases that people are touting, there's a decent chance, confidently tells you the wrong thing, and that would scare me as a PM. 

Lenny (00:26:45):
I've had the exact same experience. I had to describe what I've done, and it was like 70% mistaken. 

Casey Winters (00:26:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:26:53):
Is there anything you've found value in yet with GPT of any kind in your work, or is it still kind of just poking around and novelty for you?

Casey Winters (00:27:00):
Yeah. I've had a couple of those things where it's like, "Hey, how do I actually get this weird thing done?" It's been like clear bullet points, take these steps, and I'm like, "Oh, great. This was actually really hard to find on Google." Things like that, I actually quite like it for, so that's where my head goes to more confidently use it. Of course, I'll try it and if it's wrong-

Lenny (00:27:24):
Just throw it away. 

Casey Winters (00:27:25):
... I'll learn where it's wrong, so it's low-risk, but it's been right on some of those things and it's like, "Oh, cool. I couldn't figure out how to do that." There was something on Google Docs that I needed to figure out how to do that was kind of fancy. I asked ChatGPT. It told me how to do it, and I was like, "Oh, great." 

Lenny (00:27:39):
I had a similar experience where I just needed a formula in Google Sheets, and just told it like, "I need this thing," and it just gives me the actual formula. 

Casey Winters (00:27:45):
Yeah, that's so magical when it happens. 

Lenny (00:27:47):
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not that good with Sheets formulas. Shifting course a little bit, you also wrote this really interesting post on founder intuition versus team expertise. There's a lot to it, and I think it's a really interesting topic because it's this classic discussion that startups have. How much should a founder trust their gut, and how much should it be top-down, "Here's what we should be doing" versus the team, bottom-up, figure out what to build? I'd love to spend a little time here. Maybe just to start broadly, what is this? You came up with a framework of how to think about when founder intuition should overrule, say, team expertise, and how that change over time, so maybe just talk about that. 

Casey Winters (00:28:26):
Yeah. If founders are lucky/good enough to find product-market fit, they've usually built up all this intuition about their customers, about their product, and their business that are really hard to explain to others and may even be subconscious. When they start to hire people, these people will come in with a lot of excitement, ideas, maybe even really relevant experience, especially senior leaders. I've seen some founders are like, "Cool. I need to let these experts start to own these areas and get out of the geek house." I think that's actually the opposite of what you want, because none of these people know the business as well as you get it. You actually need to direct them until they show you they've really got it and are making better decisions than you would. 

(00:29:17):
This is not a founder example, but I remember when I hired Erika Warren to build out our loyalty program at Grubhub, and she now leads growth at Change.org. After a month or so, she was like, "Dude, you're in all my meetings. I got this." That let me know she was in a different part of the situational leadership framework than I had put her in, so I backed away, and she crushed it from there.

(00:29:40):
Founders will put a lot of new leaders in that delegate bucket too quickly. It's like, "Ah, they got it. They know more than me," when founders actually know the right answer and should just tell them. This can, of course, change like in the case of Erika. If you hire the right people, they do get smarter than you. You can and you should start delegating. Many founders don't notice the signals where their founder intuition has been usurped by team expertise, or maybe it's just ebbed in effectiveness over time. That, of course, makes sense. Founders have all these different things they're dealing with, and your employees can really dive deep in certain areas. I encourage employees to proactively signal both directions, like, "Hey, I need direction from you." Or, "Hey, I got it from here. Trust me on this one."

Lenny (00:30:27):
Interesting. You're saying, as a founder, the heuristic should be if you feel confident about a decision, generally, you should be clear, like, "Hey, I think I know what we need to be doing here," and don't just make people feel better, necessarily, by just saying, "Okay. You tell us what you want to do." Then on the flip side, as an employee at the company, if you feel really confident about something, make it clear to the founder like, "I really think this is the right move." Is there anything more you want to add there?

Casey Winters (00:30:55):
Yeah. Well, there's obviously the feedback loop of that, of what happens when you do either of those things. Depending on the founder's response to that or the employee's response to that, there's different approaches you can take.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Part of this, you have this cool chart of just over time, the founder expertise becomes less and less relevant. I guess, is that because they just don't spend as much time with the customers because they have other stuff going on or they hire people that are smarter, and then over time, the team expertise goes up?

Casey Winters (00:31:26):
If you're lucky enough to scale a company, there's just more and more things going on that all will reach the founder in some way, but it means more breadth and less depth on any particular issue, and the reverse is true for people you hire. They're able to get really deep into things that maybe you were really deep into two years ago but you just can't stay deep in anymore. I built this chart on, or I guess I should say table on the different phases of a startup. When you're finding product-market fit, everything goes through the founders. You cannot outsource that.

(00:32:08):
Then when you start scaling the company because you found product-market fit, it's the first time that founders run into this classic problem of what got you here won't get you there. What got you to product-market fit was iterating on product and doing things that don't scale. Guess what? You found a product that works. Don't do that anymore. Make it scale. Don't come up with new products. You found the one that works. The reason I came up with this framework originally is when I was at Grubhub, we were scaling pretty nicely and fairly organically. 

(00:32:39):
I think Mike and Matt, the founders, had intuited these phases of building a company pretty well, but we acquired a competitor and I saw how that company we acquired operated. Even though they were largely in the same phase as us, they still operated like they were founding the company. Everything was going through the founder. Intuitively, I was like, "Oh, this is why we're acquiring you, and not the other way around." 

(00:33:09):
I think it's really hard for founders to get those signals organically, and I think it's up to us as employees to help. The founders can listen to the signals or not listen to those signals, but that's part of why we're here, but we should also give those signals when we're confident we really get it. Not come in day one being, "I know what your sales strategy should be. You're doing it all wrong." Because chances are, the founders weren't doing it all wrong. They knew something you don't know about yet.

Lenny (00:33:34):
What is it that you think made it such that you won and they didn't? Is it because they didn't invest, they didn't shift to scaling and delegating to their employees as much as the founder just telling everyone to do it?

Casey Winters (00:33:43):
Correct, right. Everything was not moving as quickly because everything had to go through the same person to get done. It just allowed them to not launch as many markets, not sign up as many restaurants, to not figure out as many growth channels, yeah, as we had done.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Got it. They just bottlenecked themselves and they weren't able to move as fast because the founder thought they needed to make these decisions, and they were still the ones that knew everything.

Casey Winters (00:34:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:34:09):
That makes me think about most companies. Maybe not most, but many founders just believe they have the answers. They are confident they know what to do, and it's rare they get to a place of like, "Nah, I actually don't."

# 10 growth tactics that never work | Elena Verna (Amplitude, Miro, Dropbox, SurveyMonkey)

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
Growth is a fairly new field. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
We're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:00:26):
We live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
Powerful words. I'm loving this list already.

Elena Verna (00:00:45):
Number two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
A lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.

Elena Verna (00:01:14):
Number three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down. If you spend any time working on product growth or lead people or work with people working on growth, this episode is for you.

(00:04:40):
Elena, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast, our first ever third-time repeat guest. What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, "Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world"

Elena Verna (00:05:23):
Thank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
That needs to be my KPI on this podcast, "Insights per minute."

Elena Verna (00:05:40):
I think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):
That is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.

Elena Verna (00:05:54):
It's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
Already insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.

Elena Verna (00:06:36):
Growth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.

(00:07:35):
There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, "Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth." And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Amazing. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:08:34):
Number one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.

(00:09:17):
We live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.

(00:10:09):
That just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.

(00:10:35):
And there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Just to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.

Elena Verna (00:12:06):
Yes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, "They're going to be growing," and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
As you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?

Elena Verna (00:12:42):
It depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.

(00:13:23):
You're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
That's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.

Elena Verna (00:14:11):
Right. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
We talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.

Elena Verna (00:14:53):
I need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
I love that.

Elena Verna (00:14:55):
I need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.

Elena Verna (00:15:09):
Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):
Excellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?

Elena Verna (00:15:13):
No, let's move on to number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Let's do it.

Elena Verna (00:15:16):
Number two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, "Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate." That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.

(00:16:03):
Growth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
Wow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it

Elena Verna (00:16:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
If your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.

Elena Verna (00:16:59):
Disappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.

(00:17:45):
It's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, "We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Then for folks that are thinking about, "Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth," when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,

Elena Verna (00:18:33):
If you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):
Awesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.

Elena Verna (00:19:23):
Number three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.

(00:20:22):
It's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, "What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here." And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.

(00:21:10):
And it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):
Oh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.

Elena Verna (00:22:19):
Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.

Elena Verna (00:22:53):
Product redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
And to your point, it's like, "We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back." That's how it goes.

Elena Verna (00:23:26):
It's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):
And I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive." In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?

Elena Verna (00:24:15):
The best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.

(00:24:38):
The goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):
I love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.

Elena Verna (00:25:13):
Okay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.

(00:25:45):
So knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, "Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful."

(00:26:20):
That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. "Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it." And it fails 95% of the time.

(00:27:08):
Now, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, "Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.

(00:27:40):
I also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, "Oh, these elements are always the same." That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.

(00:28:04):
And you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.

(00:28:37):
The only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.

(00:29:21):
So all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, "This is where we should be," is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
You're telling me that there's no shortcuts?

Elena Verna (00:30:10):
I wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration." It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, "Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea."

Elena Verna (00:30:41):
I use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, "Hey, can you share this with somebody?" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, "Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it."

(00:31:19):
I use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, "Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go," or, "Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us." So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.

(00:32:00):
But they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, "Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point."

(00:32:22):
And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"

Elena Verna (00:33:02):
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.

Elena Verna (00:33:48):
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.

Elena Verna (00:33:59):
Whole other podcasts, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):
Okay, number five.

Elena Verna (00:34:02):
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.

(00:34:49):
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?

(00:35:41):
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.

(00:36:26):
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
Let's make it a word.

Elena Verna (00:36:44):
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?

Elena Verna (00:37:37):
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"

(00:38:02):
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.

(00:38:29):
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.

(00:39:19):
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.

# The ultimate guide to product-led sales | Elena Verna

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
The most important thing in product-led sales is that there is a different configuration internally of collaboration that needs to occur. In traditional sales world, marketing creates pipeline for sales. Sales sells product. Product engages with a paid user to drive retention. In the product-led sales, product acquires and activates a customer and product creates pipeline for sales, so relationship is not that there's a go-to-market org with marketing and sales and product just kind of throws features across the fence for them to sell. 

(00:00:40):
The collaboration here is between product and sales, but that means the product has to take on accountability over pipeline. The worst thing that you can do is to say, "I'm going to do product-led growth," or, "I'm going to do product-led sales and I'm going to do it in marketing." Recipe for disaster. You'll be failure mode within six months because product has to take accountability over selling of the product itself. 

Lenny (00:01:09):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Elena Verna. If that name sounds familiar, Elena is a return guest and you be the judge, but I think this episode is even better than the first, which is a very high bar because that first episode continues to be one of the most popular of the podcast. Elena has worked at or advised companies like Miro, Amplitude, SurveyMonkey, MongoDB, Netlify, and a dozen others. She's also a longtime instructor and EIR at Reforge where she helped create their experimentation, monetization, growth, leadership, and their soon-to-be released PLG course. 

(00:01:51):
In this conversation, we go incredibly deep into the emerging space of product-led sales. Elena explains what exactly is product-led sales, how it fits together with product-led growth and sales-led growth, who and when you should consider investing product-led sales, how product-led sales changes your approach to sales and marketing, what sorts of data, tooling, and people you need in place to do it well, and what common pitfalls you need to avoid. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Elena is possibly the smartest and most experienced growth person in the world, especially when it comes to B2B, and I never get tired of learning from her. Enjoy this episode with Elena Verna after a short word from our sponsors.

Elena, welcome back to the podcast.

Elena Verna (00:05:09):
Thank you for having me back. I thought I would be the first returning guest. I'm a little bit upset that I am been beat by Casey, so you should explain yourself on that one.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Okay, here's the explanation. You're the first that we rebooked back and then this one just kind of got pushed a little bit and Casey had a slot earlier, so technically you were the first scheduled return guest.

Elena Verna (00:05:31):
All right, all right. I'll accept that.

Lenny (00:05:34):
Okay, great. I'm off the hook. I guess I'll just say I am really excited to have you back. Your episode that we did maybe a year ago is still one of the most popular episodes of all time. I still see people tweeting about it and sharing it, and so I am really excited to have you back and have a take two.

Elena Verna (00:05:48):
I'm excited to be back. Let's dive in.

Lenny (00:05:51):
Before we get into the content, when we met last time you were Interim Head of Growth at Amplitude. What are you up to now? What's happened in the past year?

Elena Verna (00:06:00):
I just wrapped up interim gig at Amplitude in February, so it's just been a couple of months since then. I'm passively exploring if I'm going to take another interim position, but between interim roles I always take about six to eight months of break because interim rolls are very intense because there's so many deliverables that are loaded in in the first year that you're working at the company, so I'm just advising. I have incredible companies that I started advising such as Veed.io and Sanity and Clockwise, and I'm building up my next level of frameworks that I'm going to dive into potentially a new interim position to prototype.

Lenny (00:06:38):
Ooh. If people are listening to this and they're like, "How do I get to work with Elena?", should people reach out to you? Are you booked up? What do you suggest?

Elena Verna (00:06:47):
I'll never take down an opportunity to have a great conversation and to learn about the business and to see how I can be helpful, but I'm not proactively sourcing clients, but that doesn't mean that I don't have availability to schedule something in the future.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Awesome, so if it's amazing enough, you're open to it?

Elena Verna (00:07:05):
Absolutely, always. 

Lenny (00:07:06):
Okay, great. Okay, here we go. Great [inaudible 00:07:07]-

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
I always have to be-

Lenny (00:07:08):
... [inaudible 00:07:08].

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
... open to new opportunities, yes.

Lenny (00:07:10):
I love that. I feel the same way. FOMO. FOMO kicks in. Anyway, as you know, we're going to be devoting this entire podcast to just one topic, which is product-led sales, which is this go-to-market motion that seems to have emerged over the past year maybe a bit longer and just feels like there's this increasing amount of interest and also this increasing amount of confusion around what it is, how to approach it, who it's right for. We're going to spend the next hour diving really deep into product-led sales.

Elena Verna (00:07:39):
Let's go for it.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Let's do it. Okay, so let's just start with a bigger picture kind of question of just, how do you define product-led sales? What is product-led sales, especially when it comes to what is it versus product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:07:54):
Great question, so let's start with product-led growth. We've talked about it a little bit in our first episode, but let's revisit the topic. Product led growth is all about product's ability to self-serve activate, self-serve engage, and convert that usage to a monetization opportunity. You bring people, you get them to an aha moment into the habit loops, and then you able to extract value back out of them. Extraction of the value can be direct where you're actually capturing revenue from them, or it can be indirect where they're participating in your growth model via virality or user-generated content and bring additional business through the doors. 

(00:08:34):
Let's talk about direct phase to capture that value. There's self-serve monetization, so I'm using product self-serve. I go to the pricing page. I find the plan that best suits me on features that I want to unlock or usage that I want to unlock and I buy it. However, that's not the only way to monetize that usage. You can monetize that usage with sales, too. Why? Self-serve monetization has a cap of about $10,000. That's just how much we're able to process on the credit cards before they start getting flagged and declined by the banks and how much we as a consumers and prosumers are even willing to put on our credit card because not all credit cards have limits of over 10, 20, 30, $40,000. 

(00:09:15):
Self-serve monetization is very much a prosumer use case where an individual is trying to solve the problem on their own. Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract, which can be 15, 20, a hundred thousand dollars in order to bring an enterprise-level solution to a company that has already been using it in a self-serve manner.

Lenny (00:09:44):
Amazing. Would you say that product-led growth has always been in a sense product-led sales because sales was involved and theirs has been kind of like way of describing it? Or is this a new trend and way of approaching product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:09:59):
Product-led growth has actually started more on individual use case-

Lenny (00:10:06):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:06):
... so an individual has a problem. They have a job to be done. They come into the product and they solve it, and that was product-led growth in a nutshell for a lot of the B2B companies. However, if you're going to attach a salesperson, there is nobody in the company that is going to pay 10, 15, $20,000 for one individual to solve their problem. Product-led sales assumes that there's a migration from an individual use case that you acquired an end user with and an escalation into an enterprise-level solution that solves enterprise-level problems. Let me break it down and let me use just, for example, Amplitude as an example.

Lenny (00:10:46):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:47):
Amplitude, individual, what is individual wanted with Amplitude? I need data at my fingertips to make better decisions for my product, so I'm going to put an Amplitude SDK into my product and it gives me behavioral data to help me build my pillar better. What is the company-level solution? Well, it's more self-serve ability of the data. It's democratization of data. It's enhanced insights in the more data-driven culture. That's what company's solving for. Individual is not solving for data-driven culture. Individual is just solving for data insights for them. Company's solving for data-driven culture.

(00:11:25):
In product-led growth, you can just have an individual be very happy with their solution for their job to be done. However, what product-led sales assumes is that there is an escalator to an enterprise-level solution, and enterprise escalator is valuable to attach sales resources to because products fundamentally do a really bad job at communicating enterprise-level value prop. They're very good at showing you as a user what you can do. They've very terrible at showing what organization actually can benefit out of the solution.

(00:12:02):
Sales can tell that story. Sales can bridge that gap, and then you can increase the perceived value in order to bridge the gap to that $15,000, 20, hundred-thousand dollar contract. I would say self-serve monetization is very much an individual use case versus product-led sales is turning that individual use case and self-serve usage into a sales pipeline with enterprise-level value.

Lenny (00:12:28):
I really like that way of thinking about it. Basically product-led growth has a ceiling. You're only going to get-

Elena Verna (00:12:32):
Yes.

Lenny (00:12:33):
... so high in terms of spend. You can only explain things so much to a potential user and then sales comes in and solves a lot of those problems, and product-led sales is essentially this. I think you even have this visualization now that I'm thinking about-

Elena Verna (00:12:33):
It's a bridge.

Lenny (00:12:45):
... as a bridge. Right, yeah, this bridge between the two, and so in this world of product-led sales, does sales as a function, outbound sales, continue to exist? One, and then two, is it radically different in this world of product-led sales?

Elena Verna (00:12:59):
Yeah, so to understand how sales should be applied in the situation, you need to understand end user's motivation, ability, and permission. Simple organization, so for example, if the end user is very motivated, they have full sense of ability to solve the problem and they have all of the permission from organization, or maybe not even permission, maybe forgiveness from organization, to go and explore and bring in a new solution. Then, it can be a very much organic motion up that escalator. However, that's not always the case. A lot of times the end users miss permission of solving enterprise-level problems. There's lots of stakeholders, there's a committee that has to make a decision. It impacts departments outside of their purview and maybe they even lack ability to do it. Maybe they can do their little job to be done, but not the entire enterprise-level integration. 

(00:13:55):
In my Amplitude example, yeah, I can drop an SDK in my product area, but how do I convince entire product to adopt Amplitude and put an SDK on every single interaction across the entire app? There is different level problem statements, and this is where product-led sales is either can be a truly organic motion where people raise their hands, they submit sales forms and there's already a need, a desire, an understanding of it, or end user might hit friction points. Product-led sales has to bridge those friction points by either attracting the right decision-makers to the process so they can find an enterprise buyer out there. They can understand who's the champion and what their capabilities and what their permission levels are. They can create a committee for the decision.

(00:14:46):
There is... They almost slap a bandaid on the problem of people not be able to and not wanting to necessarily resolve the problem on their own. They can be very powerful with that as well as marketing because we cannot forget about marketing where they can educate of how to help people bridge that gap and how to sell things internally.

Lenny (00:15:06):
You mentioned this idea of enterprise-level problems. It might help if you give an example or two of what those might be. Then, also, just what are examples of companies that are doing enterprise or product-led sales well just to kind of give people a mental model as you're talking about some of this stuff?

Elena Verna (00:15:22):
Sure, so let's go through a couple of them. Let's go through Miro. Miro is an online whiteboarding platform. What is individual problem that people come to Miro to solve? They have a workshop they need to facilitate. Maybe they need a board to just do brainwriting in and they use Miro for individual jobs to be done. However, what Miro is designed for is a team-level problem. I come in and I bring you in and we collaborate together, so now there's two, three, four people involved, but even that is still on the project level, it's on the team level. Nobody's going to pay a hundred thousand dollars to solve a team-level small problem that is solving. What is the enterprise-level problem? It's increased innovation, it's increased productivity across the entire team because now we have this new outlet in which we can collaborate. 

(00:16:10):
Now, can Miro very clearly show increase in productivity across the organization by using the product? No. Can sales tell the story? Yes. Miro takes you from an individual user to a team step, and then sales bridges the gap to an enterprise. Let's give another example of Figma. In Figma, I come in as a designer and I just need a better way to capture feedback from my stakeholders, a more scalable way to capture it so I can iterate on the perfect design. What is it at the team level? Now there is a team that can collaborate with me more openly. I can capture more feedback from more stakeholders faster and get the project done sooner.

(00:16:53):
What is it on the enterprise level? Well, on enterprise level, our designs are just better fit the business needs. They have faster turnaround time and our product is performing better. That's an enterprise-level value prop and, again, we're, I think, in the product development space gotten a little bit lazy of actually showcasing that enterprise value in product. We rely on excellence of sales team to tell that story. I do hope that changes, by the way, in the future, that we put more pressure on the products to take it all the way up the escalator so we don't have to be a hundred percent dependent on the sales team going and showcasing that story. The product can really empower that escalator from the starting point till the end on its own.

Lenny (00:17:42):
I want to dig into that for sure. I know that's something you just shared on LinkedIn recently and I thought that was a really interesting topic, but before we get there, let's talk about this bridge a little bit more. People might be listening to this that are maybe a product-led growth company and they may feel like, "Hey, wait, we're already doing this. We have this product-led growth motion, we have a sales team. They figure out who to talk to." What exactly is in that bridge that makes product-led sales so interesting? I imagine it's like helping you identify who to go after, helping people go further and further and escalate it themselves. How do you think about that bridge between product and sales?

Elena Verna (00:18:15):
Let's talk about how product-led growth companies start with product-led sales. It usually starts by an organic demand from a user base. They reach out to them through support channels by just pinging people who work at the company saying, "Hey, I want to purchase this for my entire company." That's an organic pool that you start feeling from product-led growth model into enterprise sales world and, by the way, you should never hire any salespeople until you feel that pool because if nobody's asking to purchase, then you cannot just hire an SDR and make a purchase happen. You need to see those hand-raisers, you need to see those people demanding an enterprise-level adoption. Then, you hire starts hiring salespeople to actually suffice that demand and that's great, and you're starting to do sales and surfacing really addressing organic demand within your product.

(00:19:11):
That organic demand very quickly dries up if you rely on hand-raisers of your champions. If you rely on having enterprise buyers in your user base that are asking to just sign on the dotted line, then you have a very limited ceiling for your growth because what majority of the usage transforms to be is to have product qualification that there's a meaningful sales conversation that could occur based on the signals within usage that the buyer is missing. 90% of product-led sales is converting the usage into an opportunity by finding a buyer outside, by finding the decision-maker outside. This is where marketing and sales are so crucial in the process. Connecting that decision-maker to the usage and then driving an opportunity through sales funnel all the way to closed one deal.

(00:20:08):
It's great when you start having sales team and you're surfacing this organic demand. That's beautiful and power to you. Just it doesn't last very long just because end user fundamentally does not equal enterprise buyer and that organic demand ends up plateauing very shortly because you cannot just make enterprise buyers happen from your users.

Lenny (00:20:31):
If a founder is listening to this right now and they're like, "Okay, so I have maybe a product-led growth component, they're self-serve, maybe I have a sales team, maybe I don't," what's a sign that your product is a fit for investing in product-led sales? Essentially every product-led growth-oriented company should be eventually investing in this area. Or is there certain companies that are like, "No, you don't need to worry about it, just stay product-led growth forever or just stay sales-led growth forever?"

Elena Verna (00:20:57):
To have product-led sales means you're going upmarket-

Lenny (00:21:02):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:21:04):
... period. That means you going for contract values that are probably over your sales floor, so the minimum that the sales is willing to engage and close, which is traditionally around $15,000. If you're going for contract values of $15,000, that means you're probably trying to close a hundred, $200,000 contracts as well. Who can handle a hundred, $200,000 contract? It's not going to be a small startup. It's not going to be an SMB. It's probably going to be higher end of more of a mid-market segment, so 200 employees-plus. More likely it's going to be towards the enterprise segment of a thousand employees-plus. 

(00:21:45):
If you are not ready to go upmarket, I would say keep it easy on the product-led sales because sales means quotas. Sales means large contract values. Sales means you are going upmarket whether you like it or not, and some products, they should stay in the prosumer individual space. Maybe they're geared towards contractors or freelancers or squarely towards startups. Those persons are not interested in talking to sales in the first place. They have much lower bearing of how much they're willing to spend, so their price sensitivity is much higher. They prefer to do all self-serve in the first place, so it's really need to be conscious about what that will do to your go-to-market motion because it definitely skews it and pulls it up. 

Lenny (00:22:36):
Got it, so what I'm hearing is that if you're starting as a self-serve-oriented product and you're starting to maybe hire for a salesperson, is the approach start approaching it from product-led sales motion versus now we're going to add the sales independent team that's kind of doing their own thing?

Elena Verna (00:22:55):
Right, so there's two ways to get to product-led sales. First little wave is that we talked about, I start as product-led growth company. I really started with this individual use case and I'm escalating to a company-level value prop and this is what I need product-led sales for. On the other side, I might start as a top-down sales traditional organization, so I have product that I only sell through sales. Those are usually anchored at larger segments in the first place. In order to build a top-down sales engine, you're most likely going after enterprise segment of a thousand-plus employees or maybe upper mid-market of 500 employees-plus. The reason to go into product-led sales is either your existing top-down motion is not working because customers need to see value before they sign the contract. They want to see that usage and at least the first signs of perceived value before they sign on the dotted line.

(00:23:49):
Or you're going downmarket and your fixed cost of sale that you have from the traditional sales motion does not scale. It stays fairly constant, yet your contract values are starting to drop as you're doing downmarket, so you want to create a lot more automation in the selling process to remove as many as possible humans out of it. You can approach it from both ways. Adding PLS on top of product-led growth or adding PLS on top of existing sales-led growth. For PLG, you're going upmarket by adding PLS. For SLG or sales-led growth, by adding PLS you're going downmarket.  

Lenny (00:24:27):
Awesome, and we're going to talk about how to actually build this infrastructure and what's required, but it reminds me one of the biggest takeaways from our first podcast and something I've quoted many times now, is your bet that every sales-led growth company needs to add a product-led growth element. Otherwise, they'll be disrupted by someone that does. Is that still your perspective?

Elena Verna (00:24:49):
Absolutely. Now, I think there's different stages of, what does it mean to add product-led growth elements? I think every sales-led company should be putting pressure on product to assist with the sales process. That does not mean that there is product-led growth, but there is a product assist in the existing sales-led motion that can materialize into product-led growth if you can truly solve for self-serve activation, self-serve engagement, and have product be able to sell itself. The biggest difference here that starts to come in, and that is so apparent in every single company, is that in B2B, unfortunately, we've let go of the products having accountability over monetization model. We've gotten into the spiral of product just builds a product and it throws it over the fence to marketing and sales to sell.

(00:25:38):
Marketing and sales have done an incredible job over the last couple of decades of coming up with these stories and elaborate playbooks of how to attract enterprise buyers and how to sell them this product. Product literally only obsesses after contract is closed and there's usage that starts materialize after contract close. We've alleviated our product management in B2B from monetization ownership. When a SLG company actually goes into product-assisted tactics or product-led growth, the biggest pain point is actually educating product team on how can you get product to sell itself, which is all about monetization awareness, monetization friction of conversion to get into the paid plan, and then having actual correct value metrics that are understood self-serve by the customer.

(00:26:29):
I mean, yes, I agree with you. Every single... I agree with myself, so I should say that every single sales-led company should at least add some product-assisted tactics, but I would even take it further that every sales-led company should start educating and putting pressure on the product to own monetization components of the business.

Lenny (00:26:50):
Let's pull on that thread a little bit more. What does that actually look like? Does the head of product for that or the head of product or specific group PMs, let's say, have revenue goals and responsible for P&L and things like that? Or what does that generally look like when they start to own revenue?

Elena Verna (00:27:08):
There's two ways that you can own revenue. Revenue stream one will be your self-serve revenue, and if there's self-serve revenue, that means product is selling literally itself, so yes, there has to be somebody in product that has self-serve revenue target. 

Lenny (00:27:26):
Hmm.

Elena Verna (00:27:27):
Now, a lot of times it doesn't fall in the core product managers. A lot of times it falls on the growth team, and that's because core product management is really focused on feature deliverability and just that incremental expansion of the core use case, and growth product management owns the product distribution strategy. Then, the PLG case, it would be a true self-serve monetization model. Now, when it comes to PLS, you don't own revenue target in my opinion, but what you do own is the pipeline that was created by product that you have a handshake with sales team over.

(00:28:02):
What that materializes in is product qualified accounts, and it's actually a product threshold of engagement that differs from activation and it differs from core engagement. It's what volume, velocity, feature breadth, or behavioral signals that account is throwing that says, "Hey, right now is the time to engage with sales." That is the bridge to monetization, that product team should own as a... even on the core team in order to drive a healthy, predictable, and sustainable pipeline to sales. 

Lenny (00:28:38):
Okay, so this is a really important topic. There's this concept you just described, product qualified account. It might be a good time to define a couple other acronyms and kind of compare them. THere's PQA, there's PQL, product-qualified lead. There's marketing-qualified lead. Can you just maybe describe the suite of acronyms? Then, I want to follow up on the PQA because that seems really important.

Elena Verna (00:28:59):
I'll start with PQA just because we just breezed over it. PQA is product-qualified account. It's on account level, it's aggregation of multiple users that are using the account. It might be on the overall logo level, so let's say you've attracted a company, so you qualify PQA across the entire company usage, or it might be on a specific team or workspace level depending on what is the better predictor for you and who the sales team is going to be engaging with. Product qualification is very much product metrics. It's the volume of use, it's the velocity change. For example, yesterday I've been adding one user per day and then today I've added 15 users to account. That's a velocity change that you need to pay attention to. Or there is a feature usage that can be highly correlative to enterprise interest. That product should be driving towards every single account reaching in order to qualify them for sales conversation.

(00:30:00):
Now, within the PQA, there may or may not be PQL, so PQL is a product-qualified lead. Lead assumes there is a person in the account that I can go and sell to. Now, leads are those buyers. They're those decision-makers in the account, and if you have a smaller segment, so for example you had more in small businesses or lower end of mid-market segment, you may very have PQLs in there because user is maybe equals buyer. User can make those buyer decisions. However, the more you move up the market, the more end user is many steps separated from the buyer, so you might have very healthy usage and you might have a PQA that is off the charts, but you don't have a PQL in it.

(00:30:47):
If you just stick your sales against that account, you're going to have a very terrible situation and very terrible user journey where users are like, "Why is sales talking to me? I have no decision-making power in my organization. I love the product, but please leave me alone." This is where you get a bunch of cold outbound, and I put big quotations on outbound emails that are just not getting returned. You need to very clearly understand who's your buying persona and, are they in your user base? If they are, you have a PQL. Pass them, go for it, but if they're not, go find it out there. This is where MQL concept really comes into play because then marketing has to still qualify a lead to bring it and connect it to PQA. PQA can have a PQL as a user already in the user base, or you might need an MQL with marketing or sales, bringing their lead over and connecting them with the usage.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Amazing, so we're going to share a link. You have this awesome visual that shows kind of like the funnel of PQAs and PQLs funneling into sales along with marketing qualified leads. Basically there's a kind of instead of one path to sales, knowing who to talk to, now there's two. Product is funneling you people that are qualified, and then marketing following you people that are qualified.

Elena Verna (00:32:06):
There is a third path. There might be a marketing funneling people that have no usage whatsoever and that is a true top-down lead, so you have three buckets of lead attribution that is coming in. I have usage and one of the users is my lead. I have usage. I have no lead in the account. Marketing is bringing me the lead, but I have to leverage that usage against that lead or have a lead coming through, there is no usage. I have to sell the entire thing still to them, so there's no context that I can use of existing usage. Those three channels are super important to identify. They all have very different conversion rates. They all have different playbooks of how you close them and, honestly, they require often different sales team to go after them because it's a very different sales enablement. 

Lenny (00:32:51):
You remind me of... You have so many hilarious memes that you share on LinkedIn. By the way, everyone listening should go follow Elena on LinkedIn and subscribe to our newsletter because it's hilarious and also informative. It's a magical combination. One of my favorite memes of yours is The Shining one that we just kind of touched on where someone's-

Elena Verna (00:33:09):
Oh.

Lenny (00:33:09):
... just using a product for five minutes and then, "Hey, do you want to," a sales guy just reaches out with the ax, "Hey, do you want to chat?"

Elena Verna (00:33:18):
That actually... It's painfully true. That's one of my most highly engaged memes that I've put out there. I have also one of the urinals where the man-

Lenny (00:33:28):
Oh, with the [inaudible 00:33:29].

Elena Verna (00:33:28):
... using the urinal and then like one comes over. A salesperson comes over. "Would you like to chat about our-

Lenny (00:33:33):
Right-

Elena Verna (00:33:33):
... "enterprise plan?"

Lenny (00:33:33):
... it's like 10 urinals and he's right next to yours. 

Elena Verna (00:33:36):
Yeah, exactly, so the piece here that a lot of companies miss, unfortunately, is that they jam product-led sales into a traditional top-down sales playbook. Now, what does that mean? In traditional top-down sales book, an MQL that you have or a lead that you gather already is in consideration cycles for your enterprise-level offering. However, in product-led sales, a new user that signs up, they know we're close to enterprise-level consideration. They're just trying to complete an individual job to be done. They're not solving a problem for their company. If you can imagine, it is like a very large funnel. You start with just users looking for problem solve. Then, you transition to awareness, consideration, and intent channels for team level problem. Then, you escalate for awareness, consideration, and intent channels for enterprise-level problem.

(00:34:41):
Top-down sales process goes after the bottom of that funnel where there's already an intent to solve company-level problem versus at the very top is where product-led growth starts on individual-level problem. It's a different timeline. If you go after individual user that just signs up for the account and you reach out to them 10 minutes later after sign-up asking, "What's your budget and are you ready to buy?", it's a complete mismatch of where they are in their consideration journey. You cannot consider a new product sign-up an MQL in the traditional sense. They're just not there yet. They have a fraction of the enterprise problem that they're solving and they're not ready to buy.

Lenny (00:35:26):
That's especially annoying because there's so many SaaS products now and everyone is coming for you, especially if you're at an awesome company that they're trying to sell, so got to be [inaudible 00:35:34]-

Elena Verna (00:35:26):
Yeah, I mean-

Lenny (00:35:34):
... [inaudible 00:35:34].

Elena Verna (00:35:35):
... anytime I even started... I remember I started at Amplitude when I started a year ago, it's like my inbox was just filled with like, "Now you're doing this, now you're doing this. Buy, buy, buy." I mean, I don't know, I can't even notice anything in that outbound [inaudible 00:35:52] unless somebody reaches out to me with something authentic that is already usage- based, it's ignore.

Lenny (00:35:59):
It's going to get worse with GPT-oriented cold outbound emails. Oh my God.

Elena Verna (00:35:59):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:36:05):
This episode is brought to you by rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone, and if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are a nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from Bitquery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter.

(00:36:52):
Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into Rows. When you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:37:17):
Okay, so let's shift to actually, how do you actually do this? How do you actually build a system of product-led sales? I feel like there's maybe three buckets. There's, what data do you need? What infrastructure systems do you need in place? Then, what are the people you need in place and how do you resource it? Maybe let's start with the data. What sort of data do you need in order to do this well?

Elena Verna (00:37:36):
There's different levels of scale on how you should be attacking this problem. First of all, it starts with just top-down intuition. What are the signals that you're seeing around the accounts that are highly correlative to sales being very excited-

Lenny (00:37:56):
Hmm.

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
Growth is a fairly new field. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
We're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:00:26):
We live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
Powerful words. I'm loving this list already.

Elena Verna (00:00:45):
Number two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
A lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.

Elena Verna (00:01:14):
Number three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down. If you spend any time working on product growth or lead people or work with people working on growth, this episode is for you.

(00:04:40):
Elena, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast, our first ever third-time repeat guest. What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, "Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world"

Elena Verna (00:05:23):
Thank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
That needs to be my KPI on this podcast, "Insights per minute."

Elena Verna (00:05:40):
I think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):
That is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.

Elena Verna (00:05:54):
It's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
Already insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.

Elena Verna (00:06:36):
Growth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.

(00:07:35):
There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, "Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth." And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Amazing. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:08:34):
Number one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.

(00:09:17):
We live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.

(00:10:09):
That just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.

(00:10:35):
And there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Just to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.

Elena Verna (00:12:06):
Yes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, "They're going to be growing," and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
As you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?

Elena Verna (00:12:42):
It depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.

(00:13:23):
You're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
That's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.

Elena Verna (00:14:11):
Right. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
We talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.

Elena Verna (00:14:53):
I need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
I love that.

Elena Verna (00:14:55):
I need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.

Elena Verna (00:15:09):
Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):
Excellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?

Elena Verna (00:15:13):
No, let's move on to number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Let's do it.

Elena Verna (00:15:16):
Number two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, "Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate." That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.

(00:16:03):
Growth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
Wow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it

Elena Verna (00:16:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
If your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.

Elena Verna (00:16:59):
Disappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.

(00:17:45):
It's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, "We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Then for folks that are thinking about, "Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth," when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,

Elena Verna (00:18:33):
If you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):
Awesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.

Elena Verna (00:19:23):
Number three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.

(00:20:22):
It's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, "What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here." And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.

(00:21:10):
And it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):
Oh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.

Elena Verna (00:22:19):
Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.

Elena Verna (00:22:53):
Product redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
And to your point, it's like, "We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back." That's how it goes.

Elena Verna (00:23:26):
It's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):
And I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive." In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?

Elena Verna (00:24:15):
The best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.

(00:24:38):
The goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):
I love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.

Elena Verna (00:25:13):
Okay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.

(00:25:45):
So knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, "Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful."

(00:26:20):
That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. "Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it." And it fails 95% of the time.

(00:27:08):
Now, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, "Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.

(00:27:40):
I also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, "Oh, these elements are always the same." That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.

(00:28:04):
And you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.

(00:28:37):
The only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.

(00:29:21):
So all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, "This is where we should be," is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
You're telling me that there's no shortcuts?

Elena Verna (00:30:10):
I wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration." It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, "Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea."

Elena Verna (00:30:41):
I use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, "Hey, can you share this with somebody?" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, "Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it."

(00:31:19):
I use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, "Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go," or, "Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us." So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.

(00:32:00):
But they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, "Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point."

(00:32:22):
And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"

Elena Verna (00:33:02):
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.

Elena Verna (00:33:48):
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.

Elena Verna (00:33:59):
Whole other podcasts, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):
Okay, number five.

Elena Verna (00:34:02):
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.

(00:34:49):
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?

(00:35:41):
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.

(00:36:26):
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
Let's make it a word.

Elena Verna (00:36:44):
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?

Elena Verna (00:37:37):
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"

(00:38:02):
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.

(00:38:29):
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.

(00:39:19):
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.

Jackie, I am so excited that we are chatting again. We've done a bunch of fire set chats over the years in various events, and you've always been really generous with your time. I just want to say thank you for joining me. And I'm really excited to chat again.

Jackie Bavaro (03:01):
Yeah. I'm so excited to chat with you. I'm so excited that you're doing a podcast and I'm glad I get to be one of the early people on it.

Lenny (03:08):
Absolutely. It's my honor. Okay. You are a famous PM in the world of product management. You rode Cracking the PM Interview, Cracking the PM Career, both of which I own and love. And fun fact, my sister was just interviewing as a PM and she used your book and found it, really helpful. So thank you for that.

Jackie Bavaro (03:08):
That's awesome.

Lenny (03:26):
Yeah. And then also you've written a bunch of classic PM post on Medium that I reference often share with people. And also you were the first PM at Asana ended up being the head of product management at Asana. And that's actually where I left to start. Could you just share how you got into product very early on and then how you worked your way up to the head of product management at Asana?

Jackie Bavaro (03:47):
Yeah. I was just really lucky in finding product management. I went to Cornell, studied computer science and economics, and I'd never heard of the job. One of my friends who'd been a PM intern the summer before I was like, "Jackie, you have to apply for this internship." And I said, "I'm sophomore. I can't be a manager." And they're like, "No, you manage the product, not the people and just go apply." I applied having no idea at all what the job was. Through the interviews, I tried to figure it out. I loved the interview questions. I thought they were a lot of fun and got the job, became an intern on Microsoft SharePoint services and stayed with the team. Loved that team. Went there full time. When I moved to New York, that I started to think about changing companies.

(04:29):
Microsoft didn't have any product management in New York. So I applied to Google and I was like, "Yes, I'm a good product manager. I'm sure I'll get this job." And I got rejected. And I was shocked. I really had thought that I would pass the interview. A year later I applied again and that's when I got into the Google APM program. And of course at the time I thought this was one of the biggest mistakes in my whole career. But looking back, it certainly is what gave me the impetus to write these books and say, "You know what? Even good PMs don't know how to answer these questions. There's a lot we can do to help." And beyond that also then when I be joined Google, I very quickly got sent into being an interviewer. And immediately I noticed there was this real difference in how people would answer the questions.

(05:08):
And some people didn't seem to understand what the question was trying to get at. And some people sounded really good because they'd say, "Well, I'll tell you three things. Number one, number two, number three." And then when I paid attention to my notes, I'd be like, "Wait, their three ideas weren't actually good ideas. They just sounded like they knew what they were doing." Those really drove me to want to share more about how to do well in these interviews.

(05:28):
And at the same time, I constantly had people saying, "Jackie, my friend's applying to Google,. Can you talk to them?" And I was like, "Sure, of course. I'll like tell them what we're looking for." And I'll help them understand the interview process. And after doing this three times, I was like, wait a second, "If it's only my friends of a friend who are people who work at Stanford and are already very privileged and I'm telling them how to pass these interviews, that's not fair."

(05:51):
If I'm willing to tell it to a friend of a friend, I have to be willing to put that out on the internet and share that with everyone, because we really want to level the playing field that we don't want to make things more unfair.

(05:59):
While I was at Google, one day, I get an email from a friend, from an engineer I'd worked with at Microsoft. And he's like, "Hey, you want to grab coffee?" And I was like, "Oh, cool, sure. I'll be friendly." And at the time I did not realize that that's how all these recruiting chats start. I honestly did not realize that this was like, "I'm being recruited." I thought it was like, let's just catch up. But I said, "Yes." And then he told me about this company and he is like, "Hey, it's like, imagine if SharePoint was really fast." And I was like, "Oh." I love SharePoint, and I would love to work on a fast version of that. And that's how I ended up moving over and becoming the first product manager at Asana and achieve.

Lenny (06:32):
There's so many things I want to pull on in what you just shared there. On the book, an interesting point you made is that you wrote the book because it was something you were struggling with and then you saw a lot of other people struggling with it. And I find that that's often the case. When you look at books, people have written or posts, it's just like, "Oh, I had this question and this a way for me to get better at it by forcing myself to write about it." Is that basically what happened?

Jackie Bavaro (06:53):
Yeah. I had this belief that almost anybody can learn anything. People have different interests, not everybody wants to learn everything. But I find that if you're having trouble learning something, it's just because something's not clicking. There's just something that you're misunderstanding or that other people see that you're not seeing. And if people could just describe it in the way that matched YOUR mental model, then you could learn it.

(07:13):
That's how I feel about this interviewing. Is that the reason that some people don't do as well as they could on interviews is just because a lot of these interview questions are trick questions. When they say, "Oh, how would you design a bathroom?" I used to think that meant, "What do you want in a bathroom?" And that's not what it means at all. It means "Who is the best customer for a bathroom? What would they want?" But if you haven't been trained in this, you wouldn't know.

Lenny (07:34):
We're definitely going to talk about interviewing and career and come back to these topics. But going back to Asana, you look at this journey that you took and it sounds amazing and it went great, and someone that's starting out, they may feel like, "Man, how am I ever going to not make any mistakes along my journey and get to a place like Jackie ended up?" A question is just, is there a mistake or some wrong journey took along this journey that you can share?

Jackie Bavaro (07:58):
Yeah, I'm sure I've made lots of mistakes. One of the ones that comes to mind is that in probably my first or second year at Asana, I very much saw the PM's role is a person who wants to say no to everybody. I was like, "All these people want us to do stuff and we would do way too much and we would never get anything important done if we just said yes to them. I need to say no to people." And I got into this defensive mindset and sometimes people would come to me with ideas and I'd be like, "Are you telling me I can't do my job right?" And I would just try to say no to them as efficiently and effectively as possible.

(08:28):
And I did this one day to my boss and he had some idea for design that I thought was a bad idea. And I was just like, "No, we're not going to do that." And he's like, "Jackie, you have to stop shutting me down." And I was like, "I'm about to get fired." I was like, "Oh, I have really, really messed up here." It definitely made an impression on me and I was lucky enough to have a coach at the time. I went to her to talked to her and really started to rethink how I saw the role, this urgency that I felt of "I need to shut people down as fast as possible to the save time," as opposed to take the time to consider that other people probably have good ideas.

(09:03):
And even if their solution, isn't what I think is going to be the absolute best solution, the problem they're talking about is probably real. And I can interpret their solution as a way of sharing the problem and exploring and brainstorming around that.

(09:17):
It wasn't an immediate change, but I remember at one point she challenged me to, "For the next two weeks, say yes to everything." And I was like, "I can't do that. I wouldn't be doing my job." And she's like, "I think you can find a way to do your job and still say yes to people. You can say, 'yes, I agree. That is a real problem. Yes. I think we could test this design with users' and just see what's different with two weeks of saying yes to people instead of no." And I realized that this protectiveness and lockdownness that I had really wasn't something I needed and it wasn't something that was serving me because it meant that I couldn't have real collaboration with the other people around me.

Lenny (09:51):
Wow. I love that story. A little thread I want to pull on there, two questions. How far into your time at Asana did this happen? Because it's surprising how often things like that come up really late in a career and you're like, "Oh, shit. This is a fundamental thing that I imagined isn't maybe as true as I thought in changing course there." Maybe let me ask that question, how far into your career was that?

Jackie Bavaro (10:10):
This was probably pretty early. I'm imagining what room it was in and I'm like, "Okay. I know what that time was." It was definitely the first year, maybe six months in.

Lenny (10:17):
Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. So you have this coach, what impact have you seen from just having a coach? Something that a lot of PMs ask me about is just like, "Should I get a coach? How do I find a coach?" I guess just roughly your experience been with a coach and then any advice for folks thinking about getting a coach.

Jackie Bavaro (10:31):
There's two different models. Some people like to have a coach all the time and that's a person that they can go to and they can explore their ideas and their feelings and how they're just bounce ideas off of all the time, have this person who isn't in any way going to be the person who evaluates them later on. They can be totally honest with them.

(10:48):
For me, I find it's better to have a coach when I have a specific thing I want to work on. I tend to be a little bit results oriented, action oriented, and I don't like to show up and be like, "So, what are we talking about today?" Or make something up. I talked to this coach to deal with this issue of how do I not shut people down and how do I still be a good PM if I'm not saying no to people all the time.

(11:10):
I worked with her for several months, but then once that was gone, then I did start to find that personally I would make things bigger when I had a coach, because I had something that I knew how to solve on my own. And I'd bring it to the coach, and then all of a sudden it felt like it was a big deal rather than a little deal. I've gone in and out of coaching, but I do it when I have a thing that I want to work on.

Lenny (11:27):
Going back to Asana, you were there for eight years about, what kept you there for that long and then how did you know that it was time to move on?

Jackie Bavaro (11:35):
I loved working at Asana. And Asana, I think today is incredibly successful, but it was not always obvious that it was going to be incredibly successful. We had some lulls in there. There was a time when we were updating our entire engineering framework from an old version to a new version. And we had like a literal 50% of our engineers working on this. Set aside half of our engineers to work on new features, and the other half was just working on updating this framework. Which meant that we felt like we were moving at half speed. It felt like we were moving really slowly. Customers hated how slow the app was and this framework changed was needed to change that. But we really were not sure that the company was going to be successful.

(12:14):
Staying with the company through those days, it really was this feeling that I was getting good growth opportunities, even if the company itself didn't succeed. One of the things I think was really important for me in my career at Asana and growing into head of product management is, at one point in my career, my manager, one of the co-founders had a meeting with the two co-founders, the planning committee. The planning committee was the two co-founders, the head of engineering and the head of business. And they would meet.

(12:39):
And after these meetings, he would come back to me, my boss, and he'd tell me "Okay, here's the direction we have. Here's what you're going to need to do." And I had to ask some questions and I'd be like, "Well, what about this? And what about this?" After a little bit of time, I would start to be like, "Hey, you have your planning committee today. Here are the three questions I want you to go in and get answered at that committee. And if they say this, I want you to ask this and this."

(13:01):
And after a little bit of that, I was like, "It might be easier if I just go, I might be able save you some time and some energy if I just joined you." And it was a way that I took myself into this higher level meeting, framing it as something that was going to help out my boss. And it did. It wasn't dishonest, but it was a pretty effective way of advocating to get into this meeting.

(13:19):
I think once I was in the planning committee, I just got a real front row seat to understand how a company is built and what kind of decisions are happening, and what goes on beyond the realm, the narrow perspective of building features. Going from features to strategy, but also understanding business strategy and how do the product choices we make impact our financial plans, and whether or not marketing has to hire people, and whether or not that means we need to open our office.

(13:49):
I really felt like I was getting a lot of personal growth and I was getting an opportunity to learn things that I wouldn't have that opportunity anywhere else. Because of my background and my deep knowledge of this product, that I was able to be exposed to this and have these responsibilities.

(14:06):
For me, I really felt like I was learning and I was growing and I didn't know it all yet. That's really kept me there for a long time. And then I'd say, getting closer to the end of that time, I'd become a manager, I had teams, I've become a manager of managers and I was definitely starting to get burned out. It's really, really tough being a manager. One of the ways that I'd always worked as a product manager is a lot of transparency and authenticity. A lot of explaining to people what our goals are and then showing like "This is the solution I think will hit in our goals, but I'm open to other solutions."

(14:38):
As a manager, there are times when my goal is backfill for someone I know is quitting in a few weeks, but I can't tell anyone about it. Or there are all these personal secrets that you have to keep for people as a manager. And there are times where, what the person on IT wants is a promotion to make more money, and haven't necessarily earned it yet. And it's not necessarily the right thing to do from a company perspective.

(15:01):
Those places where you're torn between these two goals or what I want, isn't always perfectly aligned with what's best for the people that report to me, that weighed a lot on me. That was very heavy.

(15:12):
I was like, "Okay, maybe I could use a break." But for a while I felt like, "Okay, but I don't want to just leave the company and things be in bad shape." So we worked on hiring lots of really, really stellar people, just really talented people and growing people in their roles. And got to a point where I was like, "Everybody's doing great. They don't need me. They can do fine without me." And I thought about, I just felt this surge of energy thinking, "Yeah. If I left that, I'd be excited for what's next," and then started to have this idea of writing the book on careers. That's how I knew it was time to leave.

Lenny (15:44):
It was also eight years, so it makes a lot of sense that eventually it gets tiring. And then I love the glimpse you shared into the downsides of being a leader in product. Is there anything more you can add there? Just like, people want to be the head of everything and then they get there and they're like, "Shit. This isn't what I wanted to be doing."

Jackie Bavaro (16:01):
Definitely. Tooth directions I would say. One is just that being a manager is not as much fun as being an IC. It's a lonely job. When your team goes out for drinks, they treat you differently when you're the manager than when you're one of the other ICs. It's more painful and less fun. For all these reasons, you might not want to be a manager. At the same time, I'm like, "Well, what could I have told younger Jackie, to be like, maybe you don't want to be a manager," and there's nothing. There's nothing you could have told me that would've convinced me not to be a manager. I might say that if you want to try it, consider it a two way door, consider a time that you can try for a while, and if you don't like it, a lot of people are now playing with going back to IC. And also to understand the career paths.

(16:44):
When I started as a product manager, I had no idea what salaries people made, none at all. And I knew I wanted to be able to support a family and stuff when I grew up. So I assumed that I needed to make it to junior VP level to be able to do that. And I just had no idea what salaries were like. Since then, I've looked at levels.fyi, is one of my favorite sites. They'll show you salaries at different levels at different companies.

(17:06):
And if you make it to senior PM, which is one of the middle levels, this middle senior PM level at most of these big companies, you're making as much as a doctor makes, you're making as much as a lawyer makes, you're making a lot of money. You don't necessarily need to climb that career ladder forever to make a lot of money.

(17:24):
And especially at a company like Google, there's a few companies that are known for being the highest paying companies, you can make a lot of money. Much more that you can make in a lot of startups, just by being in IC path, just by continuing to do that job. And companies really need people to do that.

(17:38):
I think understanding that there's different ways to grow your impact and grow your career, other than getting promoted to people management. And for me, I think switching companies is one of the really obvious ways, or teams, of there's one kind of impact you're having at your current job, and maybe you could work on a product that affects more people or has a bigger impact on the people that use it, or something that has more of a social impact type work. But just really thinking about different ways to grow your impact so that you don't make a blind choice towards people management because it seems like it's the only way to grow.

Lenny (18:05):
Along those lines, I know a lot of companies in theory have these kind of IC career tracks. And I find that it's really rare that they end up being really successful, and very few people end up going down to them. Is that what you see too? Or, I don't know, is there a way to actually be really successful going down that path?

Jackie Bavaro (18:22):
Yeah. I think that to the extent that you want to be seeing promotions as like, you want your level number to go up, I think that it is pretty rare. I think that there's not that many companies that have principal PMs, and the ones that have a bunch usually have a partner PM role above that, that's the real principal PM at other companies.

(18:38):
And the reason for that is that the reason a company would give you that high of a title is because they have a business need for PM who can have as much impact as a director, but with the team that's small enough that they can PM the whole team. And there's only a few problems out there like that. Platform type teams can fill that role a lot of the time. Partnerships, someone who's working on a partnership between two major companies can often fit that kind of description. But there just aren't that many, it's a lot easier to have a big impact if you're a manager of managers and you can add up the impact of all the people on your teams.

(19:10):
So yes, I agree that there's not that many opportunities to go from senior PM to principal PM to partner PM. I don't think you need to. I think that if you want to pursue the IC path, which I think is a great path, I think thinking of ways to grow beyond the official promotion. A lot of companies, you can make a lot of money without getting that promotion title. If you're working at a small company, if you're working with other companies that isn't the highest paying company, you'll make a lot more money by switching companies than you will by getting promoted at your current company.

(19:37):
And like I was saying before, the thinking about the kind of impact your work has, do you want to work on something that's more cutting edge? Do you want to work on something that your product that your friends use? Do you want to work on something that's going to save the environment? All of these things I think are ways to grow. There are a career path that is just not climbing the career ladder.

(20:36):
That's a really important insight that you can keep growing, one as a human and maybe even be happier going down one of these other paths, non-manager path. And maybe you don't get the promotions, but maybe you make just as much money as you go the other path. In theory, it's a lot more interesting.

(20:50):
And then the other point that you made is really great, that if you want to go down that route, it's probably going to be an infrastructure team or a new business unit, unlikely to be a user facing piece, because they probably want to build a large teams there with a lot of layers. Interesting. Great stuff.

(21:04):
Okay. I want to transition to strategy. You've written a lot about strategy. I share your pieces often with folks. Diving into that a little bit, first of all just, can you describe what strategy even is? It's like this term that everyone uses all the time and they're like, "Oh, I'm working on strategy. I'm going to get good at strategy." What is strategy in your mind?

Jackie Bavaro (21:21):
Yeah, when I worked at Google, one of the promotions I went up for, I did not get, and I got the feedback that I needed to be more strategic. I was like, "Okay, great. What does being more strategic mean?" And nobody could tell me. And I was like, "Well, who's more strategic?" And they were like, "Oh, this person used to be really strategic before she became a manager. But now she does just those managery stuff." And I was like, "Okay, I have no role models, no words, nothing to explain what it means to be more strategic." Quick shout-out to my book is, I've got a whole list of what it means to be more strategic. So if you pick that up, you can read through that.

Lenny (21:51):
Can we find that on Amazon? Where do you find that book?

Jackie Bavaro (21:54):
Yes. Just the Cracking the PM Career, that's on Amazon.

Lenny (21:57):
Great.

Jackie Bavaro (21:57):
And it's in the strategy chapter.

Lenny (21:59):
Great.

Jackie Bavaro (22:00):
What I did is I wrote a document on the Local Universal Team, so I called it Local Universal Strategy. And I can't remember what I put in this document. I put it in just random... What my plan was. But once I wrote it down and shared it with people, then I started getting feedback on it. And then I could start to feel my way to what people meant to strategy. Then I get to Asana and I worked really closely with JR, head of product. And I'm starting to get a view of what strategy means, and he's got a robust vision for the product. We talked about this idea that when you're playing guitar, you're left and your right hand know how to work together to play the guitar. Wouldn't it be amazing if at a company, all the teams sort of had that ambient awareness of what other teams were doing together so that you worked seamlessly together?

(22:44):
And Asana was the team brain helping this happen. Imagine a world where you didn't have to have these endless status updates and all this work about work, because the teams knew what each other was doing. And as you kept track of your own task that updated the centralized system, that was always up to date.

(22:59):
We had this vision of what the future could be like. And we had our strategy, which got into this team brain. And what's what a good team brain have? Well, has to always be with you. So we need to have good mobile and good security, needs to know about the different kinds of work that exists. So we need to... Right now, Asana understands this kind of work, we need to add this kind of work.

(23:16):
And it has to help you draw insightful connections with the work that it knows. If we know that you have all these tasks with due dates, we need to be able to let you know that maybe you have too many due dates on next Friday. I started to build up this idea of strategy and I was like, "Okay, I think I've got what strategy is." And a few years later we hire Alex Hood, our new head of product. And he's like, "Can you create a strategy for the platform team?" And I was like, "Great, here it is. We have it." And he's like, "That's not a strategy." And I was like, "What?"

(23:44):
I was like, "I've been going all these years thinking I knew what strategy was. And now I, again, find out that I don't know it." We had a lot of conversations and figuring out like, "Well what's missing?" And through all of this, I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy. And not everybody's thinking of all three, but if you have all three, you'll have something that counts as a strategy for anyone you talk.

(24:01):
Three parts of strategy are your vision. This is your inspiring picture of what the future looks like. And this is like, "Hey everybody, this is where we want to get to, don't you want to come join me, come build this future with me? Won't this to be exciting?"

(24:14):
And then you've got your strategic framework. This is where you're saying, "Here is the market we're going after. Here's what success looks like. And here are our big bets on what we think it takes to win that market." That's where you get your pillars, and it's your unique way of breaking down the problem to understand who you're going after and what it takes to win them.

(24:34):
And then the third part is the roadmap. This is where you work backwards from your vision. You say "Okay, I think as a company, we can achieve our vision in five years or 10 years or two years or whatever it is." And you say "Working backwards from that, if we're going to be at our vision in five years, what does that mean we're doing in the intermediate years?" I misunderstood roadmap for the longest time. A roadmap in strategy is not a commitment. Instead, it's a way to double check if your plan makes any sense at all and is even anywhere near feasible. Because what happens to every team I see do these roadmaps, you put it together and you realize "We're not going to hit our vision in five years or 10. This is like a 30 year vision, if we keep going at the pace we're going."

(25:14):
It's this wake up call to say, "Oh, okay. If we want to hit this vision in five years, we need to start working on that big thing now. We need to take much bigger swings at the bat. We need to say no to a lot more of this optional work. Maybe we need to hire a team that's twice as big."

(25:31):
It gives you a way to say that probably your strategy did not actually fit into the timeframe that you wanted and that roadmap helps you see like, "Okay, what would it take?" And then that can be a little bit of an organizing factor for people across the company to understand, "Okay, we're having a major launch in two years, then we need to make sure that we're going to have the marketing support we need for that launch. Or we might need to have an entirely different business model in two years. We need to do a fundraising round now." It really helps kind of pull the pieces together.

Lenny (26:00):
Wow, that's so actionable and easy to understand. I've never heard it describe so simply. Along those lines, say someone creates a strategy, what are signs that it's a good strategy versus a meh strategy? Which should they be looking at?

Jackie Bavaro (26:15):
I'm probably going to write something on this soon. In the past month, I'd actually have two totally different people who came to me with the same problem. And they said, "My CEO brought me a strategy and the strategy is increased revenue by 50%, it's a revenue target number. That doesn't seem like a strategy to me. I don't know what to do." Talking to people, I started to get a deeper sense of what the confusion and the mismatch is here.

(26:40):
I think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, "We want to increase revenue by this much" to, "This is the feature we're going to do." And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other of like "Given that this is our big picture of view of what we're doing, what's the next step? And what's the next step? And what's the next step?"

(27:02):
"As product managers, if you're given a numerical target, that is not a complete strategy, but it's your job now as a product manager to take all of the great product work you've been doing. Let's say you've been doing lots of customer research and you're getting really deep into what the customer pains are and what their needs are. It's your job to take the things you've got now in your mind, you've got a list of maybe 20 different things your product team could work on. It's your job to take those things you want to work on and the reasons why you think they're important, and match them up against what that larger financial target was or whatever strategy or vision you're getting from the executives. And basically see "Which of these feature work? Which of this product work that I want to do best matches up with those goals and why?"

(27:45):
And there's probably a few more missing dots in there. You're like, "Well, I think that this is going to make us the most money. But why? I think this will make us the most money because it's helping us get more money from our current users. And we think it's going to be really hard to win new users because we're already pretty saturated in the market."

(28:01):
That's where you start to get into strategy, that level of detail. And then you say, "Okay, given that we think it's more strategic to get more money from our current users, here's one thing we could do. What are other things we could do? And how do those stack up against each other? Or maybe it should be that 50% of our effort is on getting more money from our current users, and 50% is from going into new markets. Well, which new markets do we think are most promising and what would it take to win those new markets?"

(28:24):
I think it's that connecting the dots. And the only way you find out what dots are missing is by talking to people and communicating your strategy and communicating it again and again, and really listening for people's confusion. Because people will try to hide their confusion. They won't get your strategy, there's going to be some assumption that you're making that they are not making. So you have to pay really, really close attention to find those missing assumptions so that you can then explain why this connects to this.

Lenny (28:51):
That's really good advice of just looking for confusion and that points out where your strategy is lacking. How could PMs get better at strategy at doing this than getting better at this activity? Advice for that?

Jackie Bavaro (29:02):
Yeah. Strategy really should be collaborative work. I think that there's some amount to which the PM should go off by themselves and think about what strategy they want and have that in their back pocket, because that way you actually can contribute to the conversation, but real strategy should be very collaborative.

(29:17):
I think the best way to learn and improve your strategy, one of them is going to be working with the other stakeholders and listening to their feedback and understanding what do they agree with or not agree with. Sometimes it's as easy as a conversation. I can't remember the details here, but there was one conversation on pricing models that we were talking about, and we were each going to go around the room and talk about which of the five pricing models did we think was best. And I think I was like, "Number three is most [inaudible 00:29:44] number two."

(29:44):
And then our CEO gets, and he's like, "I think really number four is the only reasonable one for these reasons." And I was just like, "I agree, I've changed a mind. You're right. You just saw it in a way that I hadn't seen."

(29:58):
This accumulation of experiences, I think matter so much for strategy, for data analysis, all of these things where... I'm really, really good at data analysis, but only because I've seen so many experiments that when I see a set of results, I can just instantly remember like four similar experiments and what the conclusion was and what went wrong with it. And so I'll be like, "Oh yes, this metric is up. But if you check this metric, you can see it's down, which means that it might be this conclusion." It's talking to people, listening to them, that builds it up a lot. But that's one half of it, because you can't always just learn something by a bunch of leaders sitting in a room talking to each other.

(30:37):
I think seeing things through to a certain amount of time really does help. And I think sticking with the team for long enough to be able to measure the results of what you did and ideally iterate, like being one doing it for eight years, I got to try something and then try something different and then try something different. And I got to really notice the patterns and test what works and what didn't and form those conclusions. I think that sticking around long enough to see your results and especially try something else different and see those results, I think can make a big difference.

Lenny (31:06):
What I'm hearing is you get better one doing it over and over and over to being in the conversations and learning from people directly. Is there anything else that someone that, I don't know, doesn't have a lot of these experiences yet and in the room for these sorts of things that they could maybe study up on or practice just outside of this to get a little bit stronger in strategy?

Jackie Bavaro (31:27):
Yeah. Definitely there's a lot of cross applying of strategy that I think that really is helpful. One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places. One of the people I interviewed for my book was to Shishir Mehrotra, who's CEO of Coda, and he used to work at YouTube. And while he was at YouTube, he had a very big strategic question that the team had to decide about whether if you search for a video that is not on YouTube, but is somewhere else like Hulu, should you link them out to that?

(32:00):
And the team was having a lot of trouble making any progress on that. But one day he went to a product review for Google shopping, totally different product, shopping versus videos. But they were having a similar issue and they talked about this idea of consistency versus comprehensiveness.

(32:16):
They said "Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time? Like every time you click on a result, it takes you to a Google shopping result or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?" That framing, he was able to take from shopping over to YouTube and ask that same question and the answer didn't have to be the same, but it gave them a new way of looking at the strategy that he was able to use.

(32:40):
I think having that broad view and looking at lots of other products and seeing how they make their choices and how do they frame their decisions, that's a good way to improve strategy.

Lenny (32:49):
That's a really good reminder of eigenquestions as a framework. I think if you Google eingenquestions, you can find it and I'll try to link it to it in this podcast. And Shishir has a lot of great stuff that he's put out there. Good call out.

(33:01):
Let me ask one more quick question on strategy and then I want to move on to career stuff. How long should people, I guess, early PMs maybe, how much time should they spend on strategy development? And then, when does it make sense to start investing in that?

Jackie Bavaro (33:15):
Yeah. I think that for your first six months on a product, probably don't worry about strategy. For your six months really, you should be talking to customers, researching your product stuff. Really starting off by saying, "I'm going to learn the strategy, whatever strategy my company already has, and I'm going to do my research, but I'm going to deliver on that strategy."

(33:33):
But all this time, while you're doing your regular product work, so you're visiting customers and you're analyzing data and all these things, you are probably having ideas pop up in your mind. You're starting to notice trends. You're starting to notice what are the pain points people have and just stay open to that. And after about six months, I think is when you can start to put together a draft of a strategy for your own team.

(33:53):
I think you can take half a day. Just block it off, don't take any meetings, put on your headphones, go to a coffee shop, whatever it is you do to get your alone time. And just work on whichever of those three pillars of strategy, whether it's the vision, the strategic framework or the roadmap. Start with whichever one draws you the most and start writing some stuff down, just start getting your ideas out there.

(34:14):
And this will start to give you that framework, you can then go try to take that time, fill it out more, figure out what questions you have, what would you need to know to decide which of these approaches is better, what are the open questions you have. And then you can have something to start meeting with the rest of your product triad. The engineering lead, the design lead, any other key stakeholders you have on your team, and just start working with them and start to figure out how are we feeling about our strategy.

(34:39):
One thing I love to look for is repeated disagreements, "Are there any times when we're fighting over whether to add this feature? And I so strongly believe we shouldn't and you so strongly believe we should," and it's just ends up feeling like a battle of wills. Anytime you have these disagreements that feel really torny or they feel like a disagreement in values, that's a sign that really have a disagreement in strategy and that it's worth it to write down what your strategic framework is or what your strategic principle is and address the problem at that level, rather than fighting over individual features or individual decisions.

Lenny (35:11):
It's such a good tactical tip of just like, if there's continued disagreement, that's a sign, you either craft a strategy or maybe a principle which are related, but sometimes different, just principles of the product or principles of the team. Great advice. And the point you made about not spending the first six months on strategy, I love that because a lot of PMs come in are like, "Oh, strategy. I'm going to figure everything out. I'm going to tell us how to build this thing. This all sucks. Everything you all have done before." Just that rule of thumb, of not allowing yourself to invest deeply there for six months. Love that idea.

# How to unlock your product leadership skills | Ken Norton, Ex-Google

## Transcript

Ken Norton (00:00:00):
Part of what I think is pretty exciting about product management is you are a leader from day one in product management. There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead

Lenny (00:00:22):

(00:02:38):
Welcome to the podcast, Ken. I am so honored to have you here. You're such a legend of product managers and product management circles. Your writing has had so much influence on so many people, including myself. If nothing else, you've led to many donuts being purchased by tech companies over the years. So thanks for being here.

Ken Norton (00:02:58):
Thank you and thanks for having me. The feeling's mutual. Obviously a big fan of your work and all the things you've done for the community and this podcast, which has been fantastic. So humbled and excited to be here. Yes, I do think that I'm at least maybe partially responsible for at least a lot of consumption of donuts over these years.

Lenny (00:03:18):
Are you tired of people asking you about donuts?

Ken Norton (00:03:21):
I'll never get tired of it. Well, back when we met with people in person, people would bring me donuts, and I never got tired of it, nor did any of the people that I worked with who got to eat those donuts get tired of it. So, no, no, I'll never get tired of donuts.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Someone on Twitter asked what's a digital equivalent of bringing the donuts now that we're in a remote world. Do you have any advice on that?

Ken Norton (00:03:45):
That's a great question. I'm not even sure if the physical equivalent of donuts is donuts. I mean when I came up with that, I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen. So it doesn't always have to be donuts.

(00:04:07):
I did put that question out to some of the readers in my newsletter a while ago, maybe earlier in the pandemic, and got a lot of really interesting ideas. Maybe that was at a place where people had a little bit more patience for happy hours over Zoom and stuff like that. Maybe that patient set is worn out. The idea that I love the most was actual donuts. There was a PM who got DoorDash codes and found the best local donut place for each of the people on the team and basically sent them a code and said, "Click here and order the donuts to come to your house whenever you want them." So maybe at least partially the digital equivalent of donuts might be actual donuts.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Decentralized donuts.

Ken Norton (00:04:42):
Decentralized donuts, on the blockchain.

Lenny (00:04:46):
Oh boy, let's not go there.

Ken Norton (00:04:48):
I don't know what that is.

Lenny (00:04:50):
So I was perusing your career path ahead of this chat. You had this pretty wild career. You were an engineer initially, and then you were CTO at a part of NBC. Then you're a founder. Then you spent 14 years at Google working on products that folks may have heard of, like Google Docs and Google Calendar and Google Maps. You've also done a bunch of writing. Then more recently, you've become a full-time executive coach focusing on product people.

(00:05:17):
I have so many questions I'd love to ask you about your career and learnings along the way, and the writing. But I'd actually like to spend most of our time talking about the coaching and things that you've learned through that experience. And so, I have a couple questions just off the bat. What does an executive coach actually do? What kinds of things are you helping people with? What does a session look like? Then, two, just how did you decide you wanted to be a coach full time after leaving Google?

Ken Norton (00:05:40):
Yeah, that's a great question. I think coaching does mean a lot of different things. I mean it depends on who you talk to. It is a little bit of who you are, your style, your approach. Some people are calling themselves coaches, doing more mentoring, more advice. Other people are maybe more like me, more peer coaching.

(00:06:01):
To me, I see executive coaching as a partnership or creative partnership. It's all about helping my client reach their goals, their potential, whatever that means to them. So an important thing about coaching is the definition of success does belong to the client. I don't have an agenda. I don't have a set of things I'm trying to share, teach, learn. It really is fundamentally up to them, which means every client is completely different. They have different sense of where they want to go. Different barriers that might be standing in their way.

(00:06:35):
My coaching practice, I coach the whole person. So there is no restriction on what we might talk on, what we might work on together. It's not limited to product. It's not even limited to work or even leadership. It's wherever they want to go, whatever change, transformation means to them.

(00:06:52):
As coaches, we bring a bunch of tools to the conversation. The most important ones, honestly, are probably listening and curiosity, intuition, open-mindedness, really there to help challenge them to see things in different ways, help them tap into their imagination, figure out when there might be underlying beliefs, help them connect dots that need to be connected, help them disconnect things that feel connected. There's a lot of exploration to it.

(00:07:20):
It's very jazz-like. My love of jazz has been shared before, but there is an improvisation to it. What coaching is really powerful is you may not necessarily know where you're going when you start and you follow wherever there is meaning and change for that individual, wherever is they want to go.

(00:07:38):
The question around what brought me into it was actually interesting. I, honestly working with my own executive coach, started to figure out what it is that mattered to me, what I liked, what my values were, what my purpose was, started to unpack that I love deeply connecting with people and I love helping people change and grow.

(00:08:01):
The moments when I had the opportunity to do that as a manager, as a product leader were the most fulfilling parts of my career. And so, I started to unpack that and figure out what would it look like if that was what I did.

(00:08:15):
The other part of the journey was, for several years at Google, I worked at GV. It's Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm. I had the opportunity to work with founders and product leaders in the portfolio. I started to simultaneously recognize the shortcomings of giving advice, because it seemed like, well, I can meet with these folks, I could tell them what I did, I could tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions.

(00:08:41):
You start to realize advice is not as powerful as you might think it is. It's a little bit like cotton candy. Doesn't have a lot of nutrition. You get a nice sugar high. You feel great, both sides feel happy, but then a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed.

(00:08:57):
That's because it doesn't often confront the real problem. It often isn't relevant. Like what worked for us at Google may not have worked anywhere else. It may not even have worked at Google for all I know. I feel like there were years at Google where all we were doing was making things worse by showing up and we should just all have gone sat on a beach somewhere, and the company would've grown even faster. So who knows?

(00:09:20):
I mean so it was these just twin pillars of wanting to figure out where I could do what I like the most, and then also recognizing that where growth comes from is less around advice and telling people what to do and more about helping them figure out their own path, their own way. Then that ultimately you brought me into, hey, I want to do this full time, and that's what I've been doing ever since.

Lenny (00:09:46):
When do you find people come to you to get advice and coaching? What kind of clients do you find you end up working with?

Ken Norton (00:09:53):
That's a great question. Generally speaking, I work with senior product leaders, however you want to define that. Typically, these are chief product officers, VPs of product at startups, largely director level and above at bigger tech companies, some CEOs, other C-level execs in there. I think really anyone that considers themselves in a product leadership role.

(00:10:15):
Often they come to me because there's a career milestone or a crossroads, and it could be that they now find themselves in the position of being a CPO for the first time. Maybe there's a new industry change, or they've gone from a big company to a startup and a have this sense of what got me here isn't going to get me there. That's oftentimes when they reach out for coaching.

(00:10:41):
I think my clients are also very introspective and surrounded by great mentors and advisors and have all sorts of people in their life who can help them, but are realizing that a lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get them to the next level. And so, this transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am. That's often when people come to me.

Lenny (00:11:08):
You said that the way you coach is about the whole person. I'm curious ... I don't know if there's an answer to this, but when people come to get help and coaching, how much of their blocks, I guess, are rooted in their regular life versus skills, technical skills, and more like the PME, product leadership side, if that makes sense?

Ken Norton (00:11:31):
Yeah, I think ... Well, let me maybe try to illustrate this with an example from my life right now. Indulge me, I'm going to go a little bit left field here, but I promise [inaudible 00:11:45].

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's do it.

Ken Norton (00:11:46):
So we are teaching our 16-year-old son how to drive. So he just got his driver's permit. Do you remember when you learned how to drive, Lenny?

Lenny (00:11:56):
I do. Yup.

Ken Norton (00:11:58):
Yeah. Yeah. So it's scary. I don't know if you know how your parents might have felt, but-

Lenny (00:12:04):
Nope, [inaudible 00:12:06].

Ken Norton (00:12:06):
... [inaudible 00:12:06] on the other side of it. It's a whole new journey. Look, he's a smart kid. He's going to do great. But it helped me actually think back to when I learned how to drive. Actually, what I think is maybe a little bit more important here is before you learn to drive. And so, if you think about it as a ... When you're a kid, cars just go places. You get strapped in and you just wait and you get impatient. Then eventually you go somewhere. You're not even consciously aware of the concept of driving. Just cars just happen and you're not even aware of it.

(00:12:41):
As you get a little bit older, you start to become curious. You start to figure out, oh, that wheel has something to do with it. You turn the wheel. Maybe you start to understand there's pedals. But it also just seems really simple. Just like you get in the car and you drive it and you go somewhere. Maybe as you get older, you end up maybe even being a little bit of a smart Alec about how easy it looks and you start talking to your parents about, like, "It doesn't look hard. I can do this."

(00:13:07):
Now suddenly you're behind the wheel of the car. This is what my son is doing. Wow. Is it different than you thought it was going to be? Is it way more complicated? You have to remember check your mirrors. You've got to look before you turn. You didn't even know what that sign meant. You didn't know what those stripes meant. It is just overloading with complication and your internal mindset for confronting this challenge is not going to suit you the way you used to approach the world.

(00:13:44):
Maybe to put it in product leadership, product terms, everyone around you has got some real pithy advice about the things you're forgetting to do. It's like, "Hey, don't forget to check your mirror." Everyone's got a framework. It's like, "Ah, do you know about the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Wait, what's the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Oh, you just put your left hand on the 10:00, your right hand on the 2:00. That's the only thing you're missing. Here's a great medium post about that." Then you're like, "This is a problem is I have not adapted to the complexity of the world around me."

(00:14:19):
And so, there is this sense that what is interesting about driving is the world hasn't gotten any more complex. Driving's always been driving. But now your place in the world has shifted such that the internal meaning-making and self-complexity that is required requires a complete reboot of the internal operating system in order to allow you to thrive there.

(00:14:41):
And so, when you talk about this question of how much of this is skills, how much of this is tactics, how much of this is learning versus how much is internal growth, the answer is it's both, but the shift that is required is very much around how your inner self can make meaning and respond to the demands of the world around you so that you can succeed and thrive in this mindset shift that happens.

(00:15:09):
The skills matter, but by this point, you're beyond the place where you've learned the skills. There's mastering the skills, but there is this sense of what developmental psychologists call self-complexity, the ability to respond and adapt to that.

(00:15:24):
And so, I think we go through a lot of those shifts in our career. The driving example is simple. Actually, probably too simple, because the world is actually getting more complex for those of us that work in product. I mean every day something changes. It forces us to respond and adapt. So there aren't even rules of the road in product.

(00:15:42):
But I think this is what we're talking about, this question of the internal operating system I develop my ability to restructure it such that I can succeed given the demands that have been placed upon me.

Lenny (00:15:57):
What an amazing analogy. Totally hits home in a good and bad way. It's a really good segue to something I wanted to chat about, something that we talked about before the recording, which is what you're finding to be one of the bigger unlocks for your clients. It's also a concept that you've been spending a lot of time refining and you're finding is helping people shift, and specifically shift their leadership mindset. And so, I'd love to just hear you talk through your thinking there.

Ken Norton (00:16:24):
Yeah, it does sort lead into this. Maybe another analogy that might work for your listeners, if you think about product management, your career arc and where you are challenged from a mindset perspective, in some ways it does feel like the early part of your career. You're learning to play a video game. Hopefully there's a tutorial. Your first job is learning the ropes, somebody's teaching you. You maybe have managers that are giving you simple little missions that you can succeed at and if you fail, the consequences aren't bad.

(00:17:03):
It does feel like a little bit ... And I felt this way, and I talked to a lot of people earlier in their career. It does feel like you're trying to learn the rules of the game, trying to figure out the physics. You want to run up the score.

(00:17:15):
You get better at playing the game. You fail, but you start to develop some confidence that when you fail, you'll learn from it. You'll get better. You get really good at the game. You get promoted, you get rewarded, you unlock new levels, teach other people how to play the game. You start to feel really awesome about yourself.

(00:17:32):
But then suddenly you're put in a place where you realize that the rules of the game aren't so black and white. Maybe there's a long delay now between when you get to see what you did and the score of it. Things start to behave in unexpected ways. The physics start to get weird. You're on a level where you're floating. I don't know what the right metaphor is here.

(00:17:52):
But you start to recognize that there's been this huge change. The most frightening part about it is you look around and everyone is looking at you like you're the designer of the game, and you thought you were playing. That's often what it feels like when you move into a leadership role, to come back to this sense of what got me here is not going to get me there.

(00:18:17):
I work with a lot of leaders and sometimes that's come with a pretty significant cost, this juxtaposition, maybe your happiness, your health, your marriage. There's been this existential crisis of I don't know if I love this anymore. Maybe it leads to burnout. Maybe it's not even that dire. It's just a sense of, well, I'm looking around and I need to be something. I need to unlock something else to continue on this path. There is a sense of stuckness that comes from that.

(00:18:45):
What I've come to realize is this is the precipice of, I think, this pretty fundamental concept in leadership. I'm not the originator of this, so this has come up again and again and again. It's not new. It's going to sound familiar. It's like the flood myth from Gilgamesh showing up in all this oral histories of the world. It's not new.

(00:19:10):
Conscious Leadership Group, an organization that I'm big fan of, they call it above the line versus below the line. Brene Brown calls it daring versus armored leadership, sage versus warrior. Even in the world of sports, there's playing to win versus playing not to lose. It's this concept that's come up again and again. Leadership Circle calls it creative versus reactive, and that's the term I'm going to use. I like that.

(00:19:35):
Here's the distinction. Very simple. Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose? Very simple concept. Pretty much everyone understands what I mean. It makes sense.

(00:20:11):
Everyone also then immediately says a couple of different things. "That sounds amazing. I'd rather have that," or, "Here are moments when I've felt that," but that's usually followed up by a couple of questions. "I don't know if that works. It doesn't sound very effective. Is it possible?" Then how do you that?

(00:20:38):
The effective part is actually a question we can answer, which is, yes, it is more effective. Bob Anderson, Bill Adams are two management scientists who've written extensively, done a whole bunch of research, and they have looked at every possible dimension you can imagine of success, both leadership capability, they've looked at revenue, brand, profitability, everything, and it's shown, yes, this creative form of leadership is in every possible way positively correlated with success and reactive leadership is negatively correlated. So, yes, it works yet.

(00:21:17):
Yet, according to their research, some 75% of leaders are primarily operating reactively. So most leaders are operating from a place of fear, reacting, seeing problems, and threats. That's because that other question of how do you do it is such a hard one to answer. It's not an easy thing that you flip the switch of. It goes back to this notion of redesigning that internal operating system, so how you confront the world, what underlying belief systems and assumptions you have that are causing you to operate from that place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
Can I ask you a quick question? Just to clarify the two sides, what's a sign that you're in the reactive side of things? I think one thing you said is you're worrying a lot about how people think about you and make sure that they like you. Is there anything else that's going to tell a listener, "Oh, maybe I'm falling into this trap"?

Ken Norton (00:22:13):
Yeah, you've nailed it, which is that fear, like operating from a place of anxiety. There are different ways, depending on our mindsets, our approaches. I like the word postures because it seems to click different ways that we retreat into this reactive mode. Fear and anxiety is the way. That's how you know. You're just like, "Ugh, I'm below the line." I'm just like I'm seeing problems. I'm seeing threats.

(00:22:43):
Our brains are hardwired to do that, so it's not like that's wrong. These are brains that learn to do that, I don't know, on the tundra being chased by wild animals. So this is our normal way of being. There might be different desires and needs that force you to operate that way. We think there's really three of these postures.

(00:23:11):
Anybody is probably more than one of them, so this is not pathologizing. This isn't putting you in a box. But probably one of these will resonate more than the others. Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you. This was me in my early part of my career.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Same.

Ken Norton (00:23:29):
Yeah. So you're kind of like the heart type. It's sometimes called move toward other people. A lot of that came from my environment. I was coming up with product management. No one necessarily knew what the job even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval. It was this what we call a complying approach.

(00:23:58):
Here, this is why this is so vexing is it actually worked really well. It was pretty effective. Other people liked working with me. I listened to them and I considered everyone's needs and made sure everyone felt heard. But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness.

(00:24:22):
And so, again, these aren't bad. There's usually underlying tendencies that are very good. It just starts to have a cost as you become more senior. It's like the gears start to grind to a halt a little bit.

(00:24:35):
Another way is more of a needing to be right head type, protecting one's own ideas, sometimes called a move away from type, distance, arrogance, criticism, retreating into your own ideas and head. Then the other will not be a surprise, is the more controlling, my way or the highway, autocratic will move against wanting to win, wanting to be number one, wanting to excel, wanting dominance, wanting control, this would be another tendency.

(00:25:10):
Often one of those feels natural to you and another one feels just so incredibly distasteful that you can't imagine possibly operating that way. This goes into the underlying beliefs part. If you had told me early in my career, when you saw me being passive and people-pleasing like that, "You've just got to stop caring what other people think, Ken. You've got to be more pushy."

(00:25:41):
People did say that to me. That was pretty common probably in my performance review. It was very common. Even people who worked for me were like, "You need to push back." My only archetype for doing that was the autocratic, controlling type. I was like, "I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk. That's a fascist. I don't want to be a fascist. I do care about other people."

(00:26:04):
And so, many of our examples and archetypes are these equally ineffective reactive ways of being. And so, no wonder I didn't want to be like that, because that's also not very effective either. But there was a sense for me of redefining ... This is where coaching is powerful is this what are the underlying assumptions and beliefs that you have that are causing you to fall back on some of these fundamental ways of operating and not let go of them?

(00:26:35):
Because the answer for me wasn't stop caring about other people. I wasn't going to do that. That's a value of mine. It's part of who I am. But take the caring about other people, the empathy, the connection, and direct it in a more creative way where you're operating now from a place of purpose and vision and not reacting and protecting and defending and wanting to be.

(00:26:56):
For me, the key to that was letting go of needing to be liked and redefining it as an admiration that takes place over time. So rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, "I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat." That was part of the unlock for me.

(00:27:25):
Again, I care about other people. That's a natural gift that underlines it. But it's a redefinition of how that serves me, if that makes sense.

Lenny (00:27:34):
Say someone's in that first bucket ... And I was definitely in that first bucket. I still want people to like me and I still probably have flaws there. But say you're a PM and you're like, "Oh, man. That's exactly how I am acting right now." It sounds like is the core of it just a mindset shift, going from I need people to like me to what you just talked about of, okay, I'm going to shift to I just want them to respect me over time? Is that the core of it? I know it's probably not that easy, but how should someone behave during that bucket right now?

Ken Norton (00:28:03):
Yeah. It sounds easy, right? This is part of what's hard about this, is it always sounds easy when you describe it, having gone through the journey. It's sort of like talk to somebody on the summit of Mount Everest and they'll be like, "Yeah. Well, I could just climb this mountain. That's how I got here." You're like, "Okay, wait, that's not that easy." Again, it is very individualized.

(00:28:21):
I think there's an appreciation that you have to understand what is holding you back. This is a lot of the work that I'll do with my clients is what is those underlying expectations? What are these underlying beliefs?

(00:28:40):
I Believe that my style was incompatible with being the leader. I would've said I can't be a CEO because I'm not tough enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not commanding enough. I can't command a room. It's like, okay, what is the underlying belief I'm making about what leadership is there? There's an archetype that I have in my mind that is incompatible with this this way.

(00:29:10):
And so, there's a need to confront that. Okay, what makes you believe the only type of leader is the leader that orders people around? Maybe that's all I've ever seen. Maybe I don't believe it's possible to be another type of leader. Maybe there's an inner critic that is convincing me that that's not who I am, because a part of it is redefinition of what does leadership need for you, for you authentically? What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people? That was the question there.

(00:29:47):
It took people challenging my point of view. It took working with a coach, asking me questions, forcing me to see places I'd made connections, that the connections don't really need to be made. There's a lot of instruments and tools we work with in coaching. There's 360-degree assessments that are very helpful here that will start to help you understand, hey, here are places where you're operating actively. Here are places where you're operating really creatively, because, by the way, most people are partially somewhere in that journey. It's a developmental process.

(00:30:17):
And to start to be able to get the feedback, the dopamine hit of seeing when I do it this way, actually it's more effective and it doesn't cost me as much. I'm happier and I'm enjoying it, I'm seeing that it's working, is oftentimes a big part of this because there is this belief that it won't work. The number of times when I'm with a client in coaching and say, "Well, what if you did do that?" and they go, "It just won't work." You realize that there is this wiring in there that needs ... And this is what I talk about, this operating system that needs to be rejiggered to start to make sense of what if it did and how might you know.

Lenny (00:30:55):
The point you just made about how you can realize that you can be successful in a lot of different ways and you don't have to be this one archetype of a leader really resonates with my experience. I actually had an executive coach for a few months, and that was probably the biggest unlock for me. We did the strengths exercise, which a lot of people do. The main thing that she helped me see is you can do all the things that you want to do through the lens of the strengths that you have and not have to force yourself to be good at these other things, because there's many ways to accomplish the same outcomes.

Ken Norton (00:31:29):
That's exactly right. Then once you start to understand that, you start to develop a better way of finding the right place, the right environment, the right role. When we began the conversation, you asked me what brought me into executive coaching. I would feel these ... I would describe it as flying too close to the sun in my career, where I would have a team. I'd be managing a small team. I would love it. I would enjoy it. Then suddenly my team would grow.

(00:31:57):
I'd become more senior than I felt comfortable being. Then I felt like I wasn't getting to do the "real" work anymore. Then I would be just completely disheveled and dissatisfied. Then I'd go try to go find a smaller team or even stop being a manager. It was a very meandering, reactive path. It was like every so often I was catching a wave, and I knew what it felt like to be on the wave, but I didn't know what the characteristics of the wave were.

(00:32:23):
Then through coaching, I was like I love connecting with other people. I like helping people grow. I like helping challenge people. I like helping. Then I was like what are those parts? What if I unpack those? Oh, that's why I loved managing that team of five because I got to do a lot of it. That's why I hated managing a team of 35 because there's no time for it.

(00:32:44):
Then you start to say, okay, well, what if rather than just randomly meandering through my career, I actually elevated needing to connect, wanting to be helpful? Then you're like what would it be like if I wanted the helping professions? It's just a reframing of move through your career in a way that seems externally to fit some definition of success and to start to define that internally.

(00:33:11):
That is the very definition of the reactive versus creative mindset. Reactive, allowing the world to set the expectations and try to meet them versus tap into what your real, true sense of purpose and vision is. Then use that to navigate the world.

Lenny (00:33:28):
It's interesting that so much of this is just mindset. It's not like learning a new skill as a leader or a product manager. It's just seeing yourself in the world differently. All of a sudden you unlock your career. Is that what you find?

Ken Norton (00:33:40):
Absolutely. That's why I think so much of the focus on the skills, the frameworks, it can be limited as you develop these capabilities, because it's inner work. Where we're talking about is this is all me.

(00:33:57):
Now that's empowering. There's empowerment to be able to say I want to change something and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of other people convincing and persuading them, getting into an executive ... This is all me. But it also, in some ways, makes it harder because it is all you. In coaching, it's all about you. It's all about that. Who am I and what matters to me? What underlying belief systems, inner voices are challenging me in ways that I want to be challenged? What is my unique ...

(00:34:31):
I love the word authenticity. It's, like you were just talking about, like what is my authentic way to lead, and then how do I center that rather than trying to fit into someone else's definition of what leadership might be?

(00:34:43):
You may recognize I can't be that authentic way of leader at this place or in this place type of company, but I know how to find it and I'm going to go find it.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Do you have any more examples of either someone uncovering this about themselves, or another mindset shift that you can make in one of these other buckets, similar to the idea of I'll think about people over the long term versus immediately?

Ken Norton (00:35:10):
Yeah. It really does vary. You start to pick up on that shift when it's less of the goals being defined externally and more of the goals being defined internally. So you'll have a conversation with somebody who's new to coaching and you'll say, "What do you want?" They'll be like, "Well, I want to get promoted to VP." "Why?" "Because I want to be a VP." It's like, "Well, what's important about being VP?" "Well, because ... " Eventually the answer is, well, because it's there and that's the thing that I'm supposed to do.

(03:02):
Merci, thank you so much for joining me. I've always been such a fan of yours from afar through your writing and your Twitter. We've interacted a bit on Twitter. We've never really had a deep conversation. And so I'm really excited. And so, welcome.

Merci Grace (03:18):
Thank you. Excited to be here.

Lenny (03:20):
I'm excited to chat. You have this incredible background. You're a founder, you're a game designer, you're head of product, head of growth at Slack. Then you became a VC. Now you're a founder again. Such an impressive and unusual journey. I'm curious how you got into product initially, and then just how did you work your way up to head of product and the head of growth at Slack?

Merci Grace (03:42):
Yeah, I got into product accidentally. I was first a game designer and actually started a venture-backed game studio right after college when I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I got my first term sheet as a founder before I knew what venture capital was. Purely accidental. And it's funny because my career arc went founder, game designer, product management, VC, CEO of your own startup, something that people try to do on purpose now, and I was not trying to do it on purpose at all. I was just following my curiosity and my love of how thinking works and how people make decisions. And so that really went from games, to product management, to venture, and then back into product.

Lenny (04:32):
Having been in VC now, having your own startup, what did you learn in that time that maybe surprised you now being a founder that, "Oh, wow. That was useful to learn and experience"?

Merci Grace (04:42):
Oh, yeah. So many things. I think one of the things that is quite obvious from the get-go, when you have had a few months under your belt, you've been seeing a bunch of pitches, and seeing the one-on-one pitches and then seeing the partner meeting pitches, is how different really great CEOs and startup leaders are at storytelling, at coming up with a pithy answer, at owning the room. The fundamentals of their businesses might not even look a lot better, but when you're in that room, you feel so differently about it. So I think how much really the founder matters.

(05:21):
And then the other thing, and this is my surprising thing about venture that I tell people that I didn't expect to learn, which is, especially on Twitter and even in the media and the press, some merger happens or doesn't happen, some deal happens or doesn't happen, and there's a lot of armchair quarterbacking where people are sort of filling in, "Oh, that happened because this fundamental shift in the market for X, Y, Z, because this research division and blah, blah, blah," a lot of things that seem really objective and really rational, but deals happen or don't happen typically because of interpersonal dynamics and sometimes even just personality clashes or petty holdouts from years before. And so I think how personal it is and how it's not always necessarily about the fundamentals of business. It's oftentimes because people just can see you as a founder, or CEO, or can see you running something like this. And so it's very subjective, more subjective than I thought it would be.

Lenny (06:32):
It's interesting. In both examples it comes back to the founder and how they present and how they behave. On the first point, presenting storytelling, being someone that VCs respect and want to invest in, is there anything that you have learned how to get better at that sort of thing, or is it just do it for a while and you'll get better? Is there something that folks can do to get stronger at that?

Merci Grace (06:54):
Yeah. When you have the opportunity to tell the story, when you have a pitch, when you're writing a blog post, when you're speaking at a conference, really, it's your stage. You get to manage the narrative and to say things in a certain way, position things in a certain way. And so that's where writing is really important. So even for a pitch or a conference talk or something like that, always start with an outline, always get really clear about, what's the arc of the story that you're telling?

(07:25):
And honestly, looking at things like movies and TV shows, every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention. And so I think that's one of the things that people often try to fit whatever the template they think is. And often in business, it ends up being, "Oh, what's this more staid, boring way to say this?" And in truth, great storytellers are not boring and they don't seem businessy.

Lenny (08:09):
I love that very tactical piece of advice. Start with the action and the climax and work backwards from that, almost. Are there any examples of that that you recall of a founder doing that or a story that does that, just to make it even more concrete?

Merci Grace (08:21):
That is how great pitches always go. So oftentimes, and this is just every sort of mediocre pitch, mediocre pitch deck that you see will start with, "Oh, here's the market," or something like that, right? Which is like, this isn't a presentation about the market. This is a presentation about you. And so if you are going to say that you're the only founder that could start this company, or you have this really unique insight, start there. Even though it feels like you haven't built up to it yet, or anything like that, you don't have to, you'll backfill all of that later. But getting their attention so that they close the tab, they put down their phone, that's the most important thing. You can still lose them later in the narrative, but getting attention, just going to market and getting attention for a startup is the kind of P0 for any of those interactions.

Lenny (09:16):
I love that. So start with the insight. That's a really good piece of advice. I could see a lot of decks improve having done that. And I know a lot of VCs look for, "what is the unique insight this founder has?" And so that's a really good idea to start with that and blow people's minds a little bit.

Merci Grace (09:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (09:32):
Speaking of amazing founders, I want to segue a bit and to talk about Slack and your experience there with Stewart. What's something about Slack that maybe most people don't know?

Merci Grace (09:44):
Oh, yeah. It's funny, especially now, many years later, but Slack internally in 2015 kind of timeframe, it wasn't totally clear to people that the social aspect of Slack wasn't something that was important or meaningful to Slack internally. And so people would email us or talk to us at parties about, "Hey, have you seen Discord? They're coming for you." I'm like, "It's similar. It's not going after the same market." And people would actually join the company with some very concrete ideas or expectations about the social use case for Slack. And so, one of the best things, honestly, that the early founding team at Slack did and were able to give to those of us who followed them was the understanding that this is a tool for work. And that made thousands of small decisions instant and obvious.

(10:47):
There was this internal campaign that was very irritating to me at the time from people saying, "We absolutely need to allow people to block each other on Slack." All these people who are using open source communities, all these different sort of use cases for it. And I went on a bit of a rant, I would call it in... I think it was our culture channel, which was just its own sort of total shit show, but this channel where people would this meta thinking about Slack, and there was this consistent question about blocking. And so I went on quite a little tirade about how blocking is a tool. And so, yes, if someone is, you feel, harassing you and you would like to block them in the immediate moment, it will make you feel better. It'll make you feel a little more safe.

(11:41):
But businesses have an HR function and they should absolutely know. You're first of all sort of brushing it under the rug and letting this person go off and treat other people in this negative manner. And then the sort of counterpoint that I also provided is that blocking isn't always used by people to protect themselves. It could be used by people who don't like you at work to exclude you from important meetings or discussions. Your performance drops off. You eventually get put on a PIP or you have issues continuing to perform your job at work because people singled you out and multiple people blocked you and excluded you from the conversation. And I think that argument eventually made headway with people, but the fact that it was such an open conversation at the company really helped me see that it wasn't obvious to everyone that Slack was a work tool because it feels so social and it feels so fun.

Lenny (12:45):
I love that reversal and coming back to why this might hurt you versus why you may think you really need this feature. What this makes me think about is I actually use Slack for social feature in a big way. My newsletter subscribers, there's about seven, 8,000 people in a Slack.

Merci Grace (13:01):
Wow.

Lenny (13:02):
And it's the use case that you don't believe Slack should have done. I'm curious, and no hard feelings, do you feel like they will focus on this in the future? Or should they, maybe in the future? I'm guessing there's just not a lot of money to be made there. And so I could see why that's not a focus, but do you think that'll change?

Merci Grace (13:21):
Yeah, it's interesting. So you are participating in this creator economy that wasn't around at the same level in 2015. The kinds of communities that were happening on Slack would be a Burning Man community, an open source community that was massive and everyone had a weird Linux set up, and so it was usually time-consuming for our support team to help get people's machines working and things like that. So I don't know, because what you have is a little bit of a prosumer use case, right, where people have a personal but also very much a professional community with you as well. And I think that Discord is moving more in that direction. It's a little bit more of a natural step for them to take, I think. And it's funny, because for me, Slack doesn't exist anymore in the way that it did even a few years ago. It's not an independent company anymore. And so I think the question would be whether it aligns with the long-term interests of Salesforce.

Lenny (14:20):
Yep, that makes sense. We don't have to get into it too deep here, but I really like Slack for my use case because my subscribers are generally already in Slack. They're at work. Discord is just such a noisy thing and such a new product for people to use. People often love to hate on Slack because it's this big old thing and they're using it for work, but it's actually amazing for my use case, and so I'm going to keep using it. And Discord-

Merci Grace (14:44):
I know I still have the Women in Product community on Slack as well for that same reason and because it's professional and adjacent and it is tied into your professional identity as a person, but also, yeah, you're already on it. So reengaging your community is more a question of an app channel or a mention than it is having to reengage using an email campaign or something like that in order to get someone's attention.

Lenny (15:09):
Going in a slightly different direction and into growth, correct me if I'm wrong but Slack was one of the early innovators in this whole product-led growth movement. Is that accurate?

Merci Grace (15:21):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (15:22):
Okay, cool. So what I'm curious to hear is what was it like early on helping figure out how to grow this thing that became this behemoth massively successful company and figuring out this idea of product-led growth? And then I'll ask a couple questions as we chat through this.

Merci Grace (15:37):
Yeah. So early on, I mean, I definitely got the job that I got at Slack because I had been a game designer. And Stewart Butterfield, the CEO and founder, and I knew each other from our shared time having both run, it turned out, very unsuccessful gaming committees, and being people, I think, who have the same weird taste in indie games and things like that. And so he knew, and this was part of our discussion, that I would bring a familiar sensibility to the role I was hired to, which wasn't called growth at first, it was new user experience. So it was the onboarding experience, signing up, getting started. And that's really where we started with it, was coming at it from not trying to do a specific number or anything like that but a belief that this is a great product and we had product market fit, that was pretty obvious at the time, and so how do we help clear away the fog of war and let people see the map that is, "Here's Slack, and here's where everything is, and here's how you can get started using it"?

Lenny (16:50):
That is so interesting that so much of that was rooted in game design. I had no idea. That's so interesting that you both had that experience. It definitely shows in the experience. So at that point I imagine product growth was not a thing. It was just, "How do we grow this thing?"

Merci Grace (17:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (17:05):
What did you learn from that experience of just how to grow a thing like Slack that is user first and the way that a lot of companies are trying to grow these days?

Merci Grace (17:13):
Yeah. I think one of the best things that we did is that we really started with curiosity first, and we weren't like, "Okay, here are all of our baseline metrics. We already know what's important. Let's just do this." Because April Underwood, former CPO at Slack, had this great line that she would say internally, which is, "No one has built Slack before." I really loved that as this kind of mental starting place where it's like, there isn't going to be this cookie cutter thing. And it was funny too, in the experience of building out onboarding and running all these experiments at Slack, to see people copy things from the product that we knew were not working.

(17:59):
And so I think when I first joined early 2015, we had an onboarding experience that had these little circles that would animate. It was very light, too light. There were too many of them. I remember my first few weeks doing customer support in Zendesk, and I would get screenshots from people reporting some unrelated bug and notice this person has been a user for six months and I can see they still have these little throbbers all over the place. Okay, this is not working. People don't understand that they're supposed to click on them. I think Discord has a similar design, but they use the little World of Warcraft style exclamation point, which I'm sure is much more effective. But it was hilarious and also kind of sad to watch people trying to replicate things in our product that actually weren't even working for us, but they had no insight into that.

Lenny (18:52):
I had the same exact experience at Airbnb. People just sit there, copy everything Airbnb's doing and have no idea. There's so many failed experiments that haven't been unlaunched, and we're just trying to figure things out.

Merci Grace (19:04):
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We're all trying to learn. I think it is very dangerous to say this specific metric is a North Star for every business. I think one of the most surprising things, and of course when something's true it becomes obvious and not at all surprising, but we had thought of Slack as a sync but also async kind of a platform, but then over the course of a bunch of experimentation and user research saw that a bunch of the things that moved the needle for us were about getting people into their new Slack team at the same time. So, Jules Walter, PM on the GRIF team, did some experiments around push notifications on mobile, just getting people in. It's still live in the product today because it was, it turns out, massively successful. It really matters that someone is there to greet you when you join.

Lenny (19:57):
Did you have a rule of thumb how many people needed to be in a Slack for it to start to take off?

Merci Grace (20:02):
We had a activation metric that we got to through some initial regression analysis, and then we tested the hypotheses that we developed from that regression analysis and made it into the product. And so for us it was three people, real human beings, not bots, and 50 messages, real messages, not people, because that was our real messages, not bot messages. Three people ended up being the lowest number at which things do start to break. So having a one-on-one conversation is a lot easier, having one-on-one text message or email, any other thing is going to be more straightforward. There's almost nothing, and especially when we were comparing ourselves so actively and successfully at the time to email, there is nothing broken about a 35 message one-on-one email conversation. It's totally fine. It's a series of letters back and forth. As soon as you add one more person to that, it gets a lot messier.

Lenny (21:08):
I forgot about that initial vision of Slack, trying to replace email.

Merci Grace (21:13):
I know.

Lenny (21:13):
That's not even something we talk about anymore. Interesting.

Merci Grace (21:14):
We never talk about it. Yeah. And now it's funny. I'll see some of the media that gets created or the television commercials and I'm like, "What is..." Balls moving around and little grooves and stuff. And I'm like, "I'm not sure what they're supposed to be comparing themselves to. Maybe just themselves."

Lenny (21:34):
Right. I think Slack is Slack now, and you don't need to replace email. I think they found a niche.

Merci Grace (21:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (21:40):
That also reminds me, I actually tried using Slack with my wife. It was just me and my wife in Slack. We tried to use that as our main communication hub, and it was a little much. We moved away.

Merci Grace (21:50):
Yeah, it is. It's funny how it's just a little too much architecture, a little, yeah, too big of a house for two people, kind of.

Lenny (21:59):
That's right. Yeah. But it was fun. We had channels for events and love. We had a love channel. Anyway.

Merci Grace (22:05):
No.

Lenny (22:07):
So you mentioned this push notification feature being really effective. Is there anything else that just stands out to you as, these are just lessons I've learned in how to grow a product that's kind of prosumer product-led bottom-uppy, things that stick with you that you bring to future products?

Merci Grace (22:22):
Oh, yeah. One of the big ones in that regard is the understanding that there are people who are just more social, right? I'm sure you're this kind of person. You're a connector and you know a lot of people, you love introducing them, bringing them together. We are who we are, fundamentally. And so within any population, including a user base, there will be people who are more likely to invite other people to the product or to bring people around into it, especially if it's something like a collaboration product. And so I thought it was much easier to get those people to share the product with bigger groups of folks than it would be to get someone who's just not like that, who never is the host, who doesn't invite people to stuff. It's a lot easier to get someone to send more invites than it is to get someone who's a little shy to even send one.

Lenny (23:16):
So what that makes me think about is just pick the right persona, an ICP. A person, especially for a social oriented product, will invite people into the product. Is that how you think about it?

Merci Grace (23:27):
Yeah, exactly. It's knowing the persona and then it's also doing things like making sure that someone has multiple opportunities to invite, even though it's a counterintuitive thing. Across many types of products I have seen user interviews where people are going through an onboarding experience, and they come to the invite screen and they say, "Oh, I would never invite someone. I haven't seen the inside of this product. I wouldn't do this," et cetera. That is advice to not listen to. You need to have invites early and often so that you catch people who want to share it, are social people. And then for the people who would never participate in that, they can ignore it or skip it. But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be all over the entire product.

Lenny (24:17):
And it's optional at that point, right? It's just like, if you want to invite, invite, but you don't have to.

Merci Grace (24:23):
Yeah, yeah. I'm never a dark pattern person. I think it was Marco Polo, the async video chat app, did a bunch of dark pattern stuff, I remember, maybe three or four years ago where they would auto-select a ton of people and send them a text message that looked like it was from you. It was really awful. So I'm definitely not a dark pattern growth at any cost kind of a person, but it is like have the invites there for the people who will want to and the people who, even though they sound pretty offended in their tone of voice when they talk about, it's not enough for them to not engage with your product.

Lenny (25:00):
I find the same pattern effective with credit cards for a subscription app and B2C subscription. Just like, "This is a trial. You can enter your credit card now if you want, or you could do later." I find that drives a lot of growth in revenue because a lot of people are just like, "Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Let's just do it."

Merci Grace (25:15):
Yeah, exactly. I think people often, and this is probably even a larger statement about human beings, but we're so focused on ourselves, right? I think that's one thing that parents tell middle schoolers is, "I know you feel really awkward right now, but so does everyone else. No one's thinking about you. They're just thinking about themselves and how they come off." And then we'll do that to our own detriment in business where you'll set up something like a timed trial and say, "Okay. Well, I want to start getting revenue as soon as possible. So we'll just let people have this for a week." But the truth is for every week that you continue to let people use it, you get incrementally more people who do convert because their timing on buying your product has nothing to do with your schedule or how quickly you want revenue and everything to do with, where in the quarter is it for them? Do they have a new project that they can use to try out your product?

Lenny (26:12):
I love that advice. Just step out of yourself and recognize people have different motivations and are in different stages of the journey and may just be ready to go. And if you give them a chance it may actually work out really well. I wanted to chat a bit about onboarding. You mentioned that you initially started working on onboarding and that kind of turned into this growth team. I find onboarding often ends up being one of the biggest levers for retention, obviously for activation, and then just broadly growth. Is there anything that you've learned over time of just how to think about onboarding and how to optimize onboarding, how to approach onboarding as a growth team and maybe just as a startup?

Merci Grace (26:49):
Yeah. My thoughts and feelings about onboarding really go back to my experience designing games where I would design the game from the onboarding experience. So there wasn't a sense of, okay, here's exactly the game and all of the game dynamics. But how you introduce something, how you frame something matters a lot. How will someone discover this? And so if you can think about even an online product that you're working on from that first introduction, "What will it be like for someone to come in here? What will I be asking them to integrate with? Will I be asking them to upload something, to invite someone else? What are the steps between the user and the full value of your app?" is something that's very useful to think about literally from the first days that you're designing the product.

(27:46):
Unfortunately, many people think about onboarding at the last minute and it ends up being the final piece of product work, or, and this may be a little bit controversial of an opinion, but I'm not a fan of the plug and play frameworks for onboarding for that reason. I've seen them advertised actually using, "Here's how to replicate Slack's onboarding in using our tool," and things like that. And I'm like, "Oh God, don't do that because what worked for Slack won't necessarily work for you." And it certainly won't be native and feel deeply tied into the product experience, which it absolutely should be.

Lenny (28:29):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I ask product managers and designers on Twitter what software they use most, Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, whiteboarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs, and that includes thousands of built-in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer. Visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up. That's whimsical.com/lenny. For somebody that's trying to improve their onboarding and think about onboarding, are there examples of companies and flows that you think of that are really good, maybe other than Slack?

Merci Grace (29:25):
Yeah. The ones that I really find a lot of delight in tend to be ones that are deeply intertwined with the product. So throughout the course of using the product you learn you get onboarded to the value of it. Probably the clearest tools in which you can see this dynamic are things like to-do lists, where there will be an item on the to-do list that says, "Click the square next to this to mark this task as complete." And now you've just completed your first task and it's really in there, and it doesn't feel like this fake kind of veneer on top of it. I really like something that is not pasted on top of the experience but something that uses the product to teach someone else how to use the product.

Lenny (30:13):
You're telling me there's no easy plug and play silver bullet solutions? God damn it.

Merci Grace (30:18):
Yeah, I'm sorry. It turns out it's just hard work. The other thing that people don't do enough is stay in touch with the real human experience of what onboarding is for your product. So it's very easy, especially if you work at a company that has a high volume of signups every day, to just always look at the conversion number and that anonymized pile of people winding their way through your actually made up benchmarks for them. It is messier and way more awkward to have to talk to human beings, but absolutely necessary. You want to hear the tone of voice. You want to see the expression on their face. So once a month, ideally, you should just have some sort of a schedule for yourself where if you're at a larger company and you have a user researcher who can recruit people for you, that's great, but if not, just go find people who either fit the demographic for your user or even are your user and have them sign up for an account and walking through it. And it is embarrassing, but very educational.

Lenny (31:26):
That's awesome advice. It makes me think about Teresa Torres and her framework around continuous discovery habits, where she has this whole framework of setting up count leads, where people could just book you and you automatically talk to a customer every week. And we're going to have her on a different episode, maybe before this, maybe after this. I'm not sure how it's all going to play out. But yeah, that's a great reminder to invest in actually talking to customers. And that's a good segue. I wanted to come back to the whole idea of product-led growth, especially because it's so popular and hot and everyone wants to be product-led these days because it's cheaper and grows quickly and there are big sales teams. So first question is what have you found in looking at companies, talking to companies, advising companies, what are the most common mistakes would you say startups make when they think about figuring out product-led growth?

Merci Grace (32:13):
Oh, yeah. So one of the most common things that I see folks do when they haven't had much experience really simplifying onboarding down or something like that is they'll often have an idea of, "Okay, here are the seven things that you have to know about our product." And one of those is usually some power user feature that an executive really likes or something. They'll have this idea that they want to have a carousel that meets you when you open up the product and it takes you through all of these informational panes. And what's funny is that then if you were to talk to those same people in a usability study for some other product, they'd be like, "Oh, yeah. No. Click. I'm not going to read that."

(32:58):
But again, that's that sort of, we have this expectation of our users that they're going to give a shit, that they're going to read the text, that they're going to be at the level of investment in our product that we are, which is just categorically false. You have to understand that people have really limited attention and no one cares about your product the way that you do. And so it can feel like you're dumbing it down or oversimplifying. And if you don't feel that way about your onboarding, about the growth work that you're doing, it's probably too complex.

Lenny (33:34):
Do you find that if you have a carousel, something's gone wrong? Or are there times when a carousel and a little guide makes sense?

Merci Grace (33:41):
If the carousel is in a product where that's the modality of the product, so I could see a carousel, honestly, working for something like Tinder, where that's basically what the product is, right, you're swiping through it, sure, you can use a carousel for that, right? But only because it matches the user experience of the core product. But most apps that use carousels at the beginning, it is actually this pane that's built to be dismissed quickly.

Lenny (34:15):
Interesting. So what should people do when they're just like, "Oh, you're going to create this whole introduction carousel"? Is your advice simplified such that you don't really need that, broadly?

Merci Grace (34:26):
If you haven't been able to talk someone out of it, you can always show them. So I'm a huge fan of learning without shipping and building paper prototypes or building prototype in Figma, or ProtoPie, or something like that, and just do a bake off and prove the point, not with you saying, "Hey, CEO, you're wrong about X, Y, Z. We shouldn't have this three image carousel." Just come up with some different alternatives, like tool tips that are embedded in product, things that are obvious next steps that you can guide people to within a sort of constrained user experience, and then you'll just be able to actually compare whether people understood it, experience A, or whether more people understood experience B. And it can be shockingly clear.

Lenny (35:18):
Awesome. Yeah. I think in that you can probably tell people aren't going to want to sit through a carousel and check every step. They're just like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to figure it out."

Merci Grace (35:26):
Yeah. Or even ask someone, "Oh, what was the last carousel that you remember?"

Lenny (35:33):
"That you finished?"

Merci Grace (35:34):
Yeah. Just like, "What was the last one?"

Lenny (35:36):
Right.

Merci Grace (35:37):
"Oh, that's right. I always close them."

Lenny (35:40):
I love that. Coming back to product-led growth and figuring out how to do that well, what are signs that your product and just general business can be product-led versus like, "Okay, we're going to try it. It's probably not going to work out. We're probably going to have to hire salespeople quickly"?

Merci Grace (35:56):
Ideally, that's something that you've thought about pretty deeply before you even started to code the product, because whether you thought about it consciously or not, you have already decided whether it is going to be product-led or sales-led. If it is the type of a solution that you need buy-in from the head of HR to use because you need to integrate with systems that have a lot of PII in them and no IC has the keys to that system at any size of a company, boom, you know have a sales-led motion. That is what it is.

(36:32):
And so I think just having that sort of objective distance to your own product is always a fruitful kind of place to begin. If you have a product that even if it's for a specific function but anyone at any seniority level in that function could pick it up to use it, so DevTools are probably the most successful product-led growth companies that we don't talk about being product-led, but that's totally how they grow. A junior engineer or a really senior engineer can pick up some dev tool and play around with it and start using it, decide to take it into work or not.

(37:09):
So anything that you can pick up without needing to have the keys to Dad's Porsche in order to test out can be product-led. More and more I'm also seeing companies that have a enterprise sales motion to capture the customer at the point of adoption, but then they want to use product-led growth frameworks or tools to expand their usage to either drive up retention or to actually expand the number of seats and the number of departments that are using that tool. And that's actually a very good use for all of the same sort of frameworks and user experience concepts.

Lenny (37:53):
We're throwing out a lot of these terms, and I realize it might be helpful just to try to set a little context. I don't know if you have a clean definition of these things, but how do you define product-led versus bottom-up versus sales-driven, I think is pretty obvious, but how do you define these terms and think about them?

Merci Grace (38:10):
Yeah. For product-led, I think about it being something that anyone can get value out of your tool immediately and that the tool doesn't need to be augmented by a conversation, or a webinar, or anything like that with someone else in order for them to get to a certain threshold of value. Often you learn a lot as a business from doing a white-glove onboarding for certain personas, and they didn't need you to do that, but you wanted to do it. So, that's still really product-led.

(38:46):
And then it's funny, bottoms-up is often used in exactly the same way, but I would think of bottoms-up as being not just product-led but also something that can be adopted by anyone at any level within the organization. So there's tools for people managers, like a range, and a bunch of other ones, whereas a manager is running their one-on-ones, getting feedback from their team, et cetera, using this tool. That's a product-led tool often, but that's not really bottoms-up, because in order to grow that tool, you need to do a very good job of finding where managers are in businesses, targeting them, retargeting, and doing things to specifically reach out to someone in that particular function. Whereas, bottoms-up should be literally anyone at a 500 person company could start using this.

Lenny (39:40):
Got it. That's really helpful. I imagine the Venn diagram overlap of product-led and bottom-up is very overlapped. But in theory, you could have a sales-driven bottom-up strategy or a product-led top-down strategy. Is that right?

Merci Grace (39:57):
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Lenny (39:58):
Very cool. Okay. So we've talked through the context and just definitions of these things, when a company can be product-led. It sounds like the main thing you look for is can an individual adopt this product at a company? That's like a sign that this can be product-led.

Merci Grace (39:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (40:14):
Is there anything else that you think is important that if these things don't exist, you should probably not try to be product-led?

Merci Grace (40:23):
Yeah. The other one that I don't hear people talk about very often is whether there's really day zero value in the tool. This is something that came up for me a lot when I was looking at a lot of these sort of video apps. So both the Presence app, where you're replicating a kind of office experience, or pre-pandemic, now I think this use case is a little more obvious, but pre-pandemic, getting on video chat with someone. And what it does is creates an automatic transcript of your meeting.

(40:55):
There isn't necessarily a lot of day zero value from doing one meeting on a tool like that, but often the pitch would be, "Hey, in six months or three months, you'll be glad that you recorded the transcripts for all of these interviews that you did because of X, Y, Z reason." That is not something that is valuable if they've been using it for months. It is not something that can be product-led because there's product-led in one direction, there's product-led back out in that same direction. And that can be the frustrating part about product-led growth is that the easier you make it to come in, also the easier it can be to leave.

Lenny (41:37):
Got it. So you're finding that it's really important for people that adopt it to stick around. And basically, finding value immediately is a way to increase retention and keep people around. And you're finding that if people don't stick around, it's not really going to work. And you need people there, salespeople, basically, keeping them on the product and using it.

Merci Grace (41:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:56):
Very cool. Eventually most companies end up hiring a salesperson. I was doing some research on this, and I found 100% of product-led growth companies hire a salesperson and a massive sales team eventually, like 100%. Do you have any thoughts, insights, experience on when it might make sense to bring in that first salesperson?

Merci Grace (42:13):
Yeah. So founders are always selling. So even from the time that you have your very first alpha customers. And it's funny, because I often reference actually the post that you did about how to find your first fast B2B customers.

Lenny (42:28):
How recursive.

Merci Grace (42:29):
Yeah, I know, and here we are again. It's all in that initial network, right? So the founder is always the first salesperson. So in that way it is often the case that one of the first three or four people who work in a company is actually a salesperson. But the point at which you should start to hire someone else to do that is when you, as the founder, absolutely cannot meet the demand even though you're getting up really early and staying up really late and building your investing deck on the weekend instead so you can continue to meet with customers.

(43:01):
And then the other time to do that, apart from just being maxed out, is when you are moving in to and usually up to a customer that both wants and expects to meet with a salesperson. That was what we went through at Slack, was moving from that engineer-driven SMB motion to then getting adopted at companies that really wanted to have a conversation with someone before they continue to spend a lot of money on their product. I think that's one of the things that maybe younger founders or people who haven't worked at enterprise companies before can discount is the customer preference. And then actually there's a whole set of customers that literally have to talk to someone before they can buy anything or just really want to.

# Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's talk about product market fit.

Rahul Vohra (00:00:01):
You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users, and this is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. That's what we're here to do, is to make something that people want, but it can't be all people. And the question becomes, how do you listen to them? And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you? The trick here is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time. A lot of CEOs think they need to spend time on hiring or org building and you intentionally, "I will spend time on product and marketing design."

Rahul Vohra (00:00:36):
This is a technique that I call the switch lock. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. How can we capture that? So I came up with the following idea. What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
What's the most pivotal moment in your career, in your life?

Rahul Vohra (00:00:58):
I learned the real secret behind virality. There is no such thing as a truly viral product. What then is the true secret? It is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today my guest is Rahul Vohra. Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful and insightful and articulate founders that I've met. As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills and also his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.

(00:01:32):
This episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles. And also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company, including why they manually onboarded every single new user for years and why they decided to stop. Why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit, and also how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company. Also, the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy, what Rahul has learned about building scaled products on top of AI and LLMs and so much more.

(00:02:07):

(00:05:04):
Rahul, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Rahul Vohra (00:05:07):
Hello, hello and thank you for having me Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):
I have so many questions for you. We're going to have so much to talk about. I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman. When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you, what's the most pivotal moment in your career in your life? And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company Rapportive to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life and just why was it so pivotal?

Rahul Vohra (00:05:37):
So for folks that don't know, Rapportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people look like, where they work, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile and everything else that they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling in BD, super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I then ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. That by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career, prior to starting Superhuman.

(00:06:22):
Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with. Because I reported to LinkedIn's head of Growth, Elliot Shmukler. He was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to when I joined, north of 250 million members. And during my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint, it's not about viral mechanics. Overall that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):
Okay. Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there, what the secret is to virality. What did you learn there?

Rahul Vohra (00:07:08):
Well, in my first one-on-one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, "Hey, I'm here to learn. Please teach me everything that you know about virality." And he said, "Okay. Well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a truly viral product." I said, "What do you mean? How do you explain Facebook for that matter? How do you explain LinkedIn?" And he said, "What I mean is, no app has sustained a viral factor of greater than one for any real period of time." Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7. And he told me that lasted for perhaps a year, so one person was creating about 0.7 new users.

(00:07:57):
I double-clicked again and I said, "Well Elliot, what about the address book import?" This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book, and then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn. And he said, "That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time." So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4, and that's considered good.

(00:08:28):
 0.4 is good for a viral feature, 0.6 is great, something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere up with Facebook at that time. So I said, "Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to Peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding. Which actually makes sense, it would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?" And he said, "It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product." That really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
Wow, you're such a great storyteller. I'm just listening here, just captivated, "What is he going to say next?" That was fascinating. I actually have a post that I'm going to link to that, that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled, Virality is a Myth mostly. It's based, I forget, on this book where they do all this research on actual viruses. It turns out they're not actually spreading in this exponential way, there's one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.

(00:09:52):
That's actually apparently what the data shows. I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is, when people think of an app as going viral, it's one person with a massive platform sharing it and their audience adopts it and that's just one to many and then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral, but it's a person to many people, not many people to many people. Thoughts on that?

Rahul Vohra (00:10:14):
Yeah, we've definitely found that there are whales, to use the gaming terminology, that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, 100 people, and they may have various motivations for doing that. In Superhuman, as an individual subscriber, if you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket.

(00:10:39):
We have people who send many, many hundreds of invites and there are some people who essentially have free Superhuman for life now due to how many people they've invited. But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product, so you have to then come up with new motivations for those people. That's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last, probably about two years.

(00:11:15):
Early last year we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea is, we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default, Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack, was still firmly stuck in its single-player origins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):
I want to come back to something that you mentioned that I didn't come back to you that I think is really core to what you just shared, which is word of mouth being so important. People talk about all these viral features and sharing contact books and all these things. And your point is, that takes you to a place, but really what helps a consumer-ish product spread is word of mouth, people sharing with each other. Which, then the question is, how do you do that? We're going to talk about a lot of things that you did to make Superhuman something people want to share, but in the end it's just making something people want to share. That's the definition almost. Then it's like, what makes people want to share stuff? It's amazing, it's helping them, something that is remarkable.

Rahul Vohra (00:12:22):
Well, it turns out, because you mentioned remarkableness, that is one of our core company values. If you think about what a company has to do, it has to grow. How do things grow? Well, let's take Elliot's advice at face value, and I believe it's true, it's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something remarkable, and you used that word, and that is one of the core values of Superhuman.

(00:12:53):
We have, create delight, create something that is so joyful that really truly brings people delight. We have deliver remarkable quality, something that is so striking, so compelling and worthy of attention that people can't but help tell others about it. Then we have build the extraordinary, which is a measure of the efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. That's another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
I didn't know that was one of your values. That makes so much sense. Okay, we're going to come back to that, because I think that is... There's so much to learn about how you think about product and how you think about building the company that builds the product. But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be.

(00:13:41):
The CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv, tweeted months ago, he tweeted this and we're going to show this if you're on YouTube, "Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late. Does anyone else notice this?" I saw that, I'm like, "I completely have noticed this. It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just a new company." And I tagged you on the tweet. I'm like, "Hey Rahul, what's changed?" And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's a lot to learn about what you did.

(00:14:12):
Because a lot of companies are in this phase of just, "Things aren't moving as fast as we want. We used to be so much faster, we used to ship all these features and now we don't." So I think this is a really cool real case study illustrative example that we can analyze. So let me ask you this, what did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster?

Rahul Vohra (00:14:37):
I think what we noticed was this sentiment, and we felt it first ourselves, but we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, from our customers, that we'd slowed down. And as a founder, as a CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear. It's our job after all to speed things up. When I ask people what do they mean by slowing down, they didn't mean the product, of course, the product wasn't working any slower, but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.

(00:15:09):
I think to break this down, it's important to start by defining what we mean by a slowdown. There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces, and then there is the kind of slowdown that is quite avoidable. We actually had both. So starting with unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market widening. Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better.

(00:15:50):
There are some spaces, there are some markets, there are some platforms where market widening is really fast and really easy, and there are some spaces, email is one of them where market widening is really hard and really slow. But when we started we had a great deal of focus. We only supported Gmail, we were only on the web. In those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy, every engineering dollar, into solution deepening, making the product better for existing users. And of course users loved it. It's how we got to product market fit. It's how most startups do.

(00:16:24):
But at a certain point, almost every company then has to start investing in widening the market. For example, the market of people who will use a new Gmail front end but without a mobile app, does exist, but it is relatively small. This is something that every new email startup is going to learn sooner or later. In order to keep on growing, you are going to have to need to add an iOS app and then a MacOS app, and then a Windows app, and then an Android app. Then you'll soon want to support Office 365. But that's not one thing, that's actually three things, because you have to support Office 365 on desktop and then on iOS and then on Android. That's all much easier said than done.

(00:17:04):
I think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no other company knows, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. So fast-forward to today, and Superhuman now works wherever you do on every combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, Web, iOS, Android, and this actually turns out to be a really great technology moat. Almost no other email app can claim this. It's taken many years of intense investment. I think we'll touch on this later, but it's one of the main reasons why we can sell into the enterprise, because we now know everyone can use it.

(00:17:37):
But this is the hard part, when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution deepening, so your perceived product velocity may decrease. You can avoid some of these things with some smart technology decisions, but mostly you just have to grind through it, and it is worth it to get to the other side. Then there's the kind of slowdown that is avoidable. If I remember my answer to Rajiv's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about. In that case it was our management structure, or who does what.

(00:18:07):
When we hired our initial executive teams, I followed very conventional wisdom. I ended up with a set of VPs and eight, I think direct reports, maybe even nine. I thought that's what you were meant to do. That's how startups are meant to scale. But as anyone who's been there knows, eight direct reports is a lot. It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting, it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations, and fortunately also it's a lot of firing. No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try. That time I had for the things that I think I can genuinely be world-class at things like product and design and technology and marketing, that all began to rapidly disappear, and as a result the organization began to slow down.

(00:18:54):
Unfortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely, I had this crazy way of tracking it. At one point I noticed I was spending six to 7% of my week on these areas, these areas where I can truly be world-class at. So I had two realizations. Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale, and we were definitely at that scale, you can actually define what you want the role of a CEO to be at your company. And number two, the Superhuman opportunity deserves everyone who works at the company to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius, so that includes me as well as everybody else. What I did is, I hired a really great president, I went from eight direct reports to two, and the amount of time that I spend on product design, technology and marketing went up from six to 7% to about 60% to 70% of my week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):
Just to mirror back a few things. One is, people may feel like you are not shipping as much as you used to because you're actually building things they don't care about, which is support for office and all these things that they don't need, but the business needs to expand, integrations with Microsoft and Android and all these things. I think that's such a good point, that it looks like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff happening for other users that aren't you.

(00:20:15):
Then there's this point about people delegate. Then a leader of delegates, hires all these execs and they're like, "This is not what I wanted. Why have I done this?" And you think it's going to speed up, but it slows down. A couple threads here that are really interesting. One is this time tracking thing, I need to know how do you do this? The fact that you knew seven to 8% or whatever the number is, to that granularity of your time you're spending on things you wanted was that low, how do you do time tracking? Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?

Rahul Vohra (00:20:48):
This is a technique that I call the Switch log. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. So how can we capture that? And actually, how can we create a system of work that isn't tethered to a calendar, where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says you do or you don't have to do? So I came up with the following idea, what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted? What if every single time I change task I just Slack DM'd my EA, but this also works in Slackbot, it just has to go somewhere. I Slack DM'd my EA and I said, "TS:," and then a few words for the task I was doing.

(00:21:45):
Well, that would create certain changes. Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar and think, "Oh, should I stop this task, start that task, I can just do what I want." If what I feel right now is, "Oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast, I'll go ahead and do that." And if I get bored or distracted eight minutes in, which sometimes happens because something else just bubbles up to the top of my mind, well, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it up to the top of my mind. I also practice transcendental meditation, so I'm very keen on the idea of being aware and listening to what's bubbling up.

(00:22:20):
So it's okay for me to then go and attend to that thought as opposed to start to expend my focus points or my discipline or willpower on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing. All I'd have to do is I'd go back to Slack, "TS: Dealing with this other thing." And by the way, you should obviously turn up for your meetings. I'm not saying just blow through your meetings and not turn up for your one-on-ones. Definitely do those things. What I'm saying is, do what feels right for as long as it feels right to do. Then at the end of the week you can see where your time is going.

(00:22:55):
I realized at one point that I was spending only in those days 5% of my time on recruiting, whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30% or more of my time on recruiting. But the biggest thing was, I saw I was only spending six to 7% of my time on product, on design, on technology and marketing. These are things where I know I'm really good at them. I should either be teaching people how to do them or doing them or some combination of both. That's probably the best thing for me. It keeps me really happy, very joyful, it keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization. So that's how we had that kind of an insight. Once you have this Slack Log, you can then graph it and chart it and see where your time is actually going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
How cool. Clearly this is an app opportunity or an agent opportunity where you're just telling this thing every time. It's essentially tracking context, which we're always hearing, try not to avoid context which switches.

Rahul Vohra (00:23:50):
I think context switches are fine. There's definitely this idea that, for every interruption you have, the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average to recover, to get back to the efficacy before that you were disturbed. It's a big deal, of course, I'm building productivity software, we designed Superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction and disruption that's possible within the app. But if you are working on something and at the back of your mind something bubbles up, you have to attend to it in one way or the other. Sometimes I just write it down, actually, I don't have my notebook with me, but it's really big. I have a gigantic, whatever twice the size of A4 is, I guess A3 sketchbook and I always have a 4H pencil, so whenever one of those thoughts comes up, I just scribble it down. Or I actually stop what I'm doing and I attend to that task, because there's a reason it's bubbling up right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:44):
I love that you know exactly the type of paper and pencil, 4H pencil, A3 paper, [inaudible 00:24:51]. Okay, this is going to be a theme. You mentioned meditation, you said you do TM, so you do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes... Do you do it that style or you do a longer session?

Rahul Vohra (00:25:01):
I do about half an hour in the morning, including rest time. The physical rest component of it is very important to me. So it's 20 minutes of the actual meditation, then 10 minutes of rest. I do that in the morning as well as in the afternoon at around 3:00 PM

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
And you just carve that out in your calendar. Everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock, he's going to be out.

Rahul Vohra (00:25:17):
Absolutely. My EA knows, they're the one who's organizing the calendar and making sure things happen when they need to happen. They also know that nothing can override this TM block. Without it I genuinely start to fall apart. But with it, I'm able to access some very deep competencies that I didn't have before. I've been doing this now for about four or five years, and initially I simply felt happier, occasionally even more euphoric coming out of a really great meditation session. But over time I found that my ability to focus was increasing. I could hold attention on something for much longer, but I also was able to become much more creative and much more expressive.

(00:26:02):
These are well-known side effects, as it were, or intended effects for some people of TM. And interestingly about TM, if you compare it to other forms of meditation, they don't have quite the same impact across quite as many executive functions. So there's something particularly interesting that's going on with transcendental meditation as opposed to other forms that folks are still trying to unravel and figure out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
If folks want to, if they're inspired and they want to check out this form of meditation, any advice on where they could go learn?

Rahul Vohra (00:26:32):
Absolutely, a lot. But in summary, have a coach teach you. I had many false starts myself with meditation, trying the various apps, learning from books. None of it really worked for me. What worked was having one-on-one teaching from someone themselves who had been taught one-on-one the Yogic or the Raja tradition of teaching. This person in particular had also been a venture-backed founder multiple times over, so they're very well aware of the kinds of stresses that I tend to be under. And all of his clients are mostly in technology as well. If you're in the Bay Area, this person's name is Laurent Valasek. They run an institution called the Peak Leadership Institute. And this is all about how we can live a more integrated and whole life. Integrating wellness practices like meditation, but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance in life and in business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):
Thank you for sharing that. That is very actionable. We're going to link to that in the show notes.

(00:27:35):
Okay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might be hearing this and be like, "Going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't want to, spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing, amazing." What did this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility and that allowed you to do the stuff you wanted to do?

Rahul Vohra (00:27:58):
The biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and the rest of the company. Think of the president role in Superhuman as an operationally extremely challenging and a very growthful role. It is perfect for someone who wants to go on to be a CEO in their next role. Instead of hiring and firing that team, instead of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone else who's now doing that.

(00:28:35):
In addition, because that's not the only job, in addition, they're also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy. When it comes to, where do we take act one, our email product? How far do we go down the multiplayer path? How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with AI? Are we from a financial perspective okay dipping now and then coming back later? When should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should we keep on hiring in the Bay Area, or as we've done for many of our recent hires, should we continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so on and so on and so on. I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the list is truly endless.

(00:29:27):
Another way to think about it is, it's almost like a grown-up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and Vivek, they've long since gone from Superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization and I'm one those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said, the journey never gets easier, it gets different and you still need that co-founding energy around you. I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles providing that kind of energy, that kind of input, and who thrive off doing so. Then the president role is definitely one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:07):
Incredibly interesting. There's so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll share and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool the solution to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, it's essentially you can find people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured and that could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you. Then I think it's also really interesting, there's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling depleted or just don't have the partner you want, you could bring someone on that could be that person.

Rahul Vohra (00:30:50):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
Okay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected. I want to zoom out a little bit, and there's a couple themes that came up again and again when I talked to folks that you've worked with, investors in Superhuman. The two themes are contrarian thinking, in terms of building the company, and strong attention to detail. Let's spend a little time on attention to detail. Like I said, this is one of the things that came up again and again when I was asking people about you. So I have this quote from Ed Sims, and maybe your first investor. Were they your first investor?

Rahul Vohra (00:31:27):
Yeah, that there's a bunch of people on Twitter who are going to fight for that. But to set the record straight, Ed Sim did actually write the first three checks into Superhuman.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
First three checks? At subsequent rounds.

Rahul Vohra (00:31:38):
Well, yeah. Quick sidebar on that, he runs Boldstart Ventures alongside his partner Elliot Durbin. They have a particular interest in backing second-time founders, but they'll also back first-time founders, and they love application and infrastructure areas like Superhuman, so we were like the perfect investment. He also wrote a check from his previous fund into a Rapportive, and I think I'd made him five X that money. Nothing to write home about, but definitely, "I'm going to back this guy again." So I went to him and I said, "Hey listen, this is going to sound crazy. I want to take on Gmail." He said, "Do you have a deck?" I was like, "Yeah, here it is one slide, here it is." And there was a screenshot of Gmail with most of it scribbled out, "I want to build that and it's going to be amazing."

(00:32:25):
So he said, "Cool, we're in. Can I wire you the money?" And I said, "No, I don't even have a bank account yet." I come back two days later with a bank account and he's like, "Cool, I want to wire you 750 K." And I said, "I don't even know what I'm going to do with that money. I'm not paying myself, I won't for a while. We don't have any employees. I can't think of anything I want to spend it on. Tell you what, I'll just take 250 K." And he was like, "What?" I'm like, "Yeah, I'll just take 250 K." We start having the conversation around venture economics. I'm like, "Yeah, it's fine, we'll figure it out." Then a few months back I took another 250 K and a few months back I took another 250 K as I began inventing ways and finding channels to deploy capital properly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):
I love this story. I love all these stories you're sharing I've never heard before. And by the way, it is awesome. We're talking about him coming on the podcast, maybe breaking our VC rule. So specifically the story he shared with me that is maybe an example of you and your attention to detail is, he said that you created your own font because existing fonts weren't good enough. Is that true?

Rahul Vohra (00:33:31):
Kind of. Okay. The font that we use today is a modified version of Adelle Sans. The story there is, I looked at all of the major font families, and honestly none of them was what I would call truly excellent. That may sound like an odd thing to say. So let's, if you will permit me to talk about typography and email-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Please.

Rahul Vohra (00:33:56):
The first thing we did was, we took our UI and we laid it out in about 15 different styles using examples of the major font families. We actually printed these out and we left them on a desk in the middle of our office. Sometimes with design, you want to tune in to your immediate most visceral response, but sometimes you want to truly let a design marinate. And this was the latter. So we let these designs marinate, we let these font choices percolate. Like I said, none of them was truly excellent.

(00:34:31):
Number one, I was looking for a font that was in and of itself gorgeous. Number two, I was looking for a font that could also convey a message of any kind, without overpowering the sentiment of that message. For example, does the font work when this is inviting you to a party? Many fonts, including almost all serif fonts, are actually too somber or too sober for that. Or to pick another extreme, does the font work if it is informing you of somebody's passing, many fonts are just too jaunty for that. You wouldn't want that kind of message in Comic Sans, for example. And number three, I was optimizing for a font that made reading speed and comprehension really fast. And number four, I was looking for a font that made email addresses themselves look great. So I discarded all the 15 because they weren't good enough, and after searching high and low, I came across a font called Adelle Sans, which is designed by a foundry called Type Together, type-together.com. They have a whole bunch of lovely fonts, go check them out.

(00:35:36):
And if you go through my list, number one, Adelle Sans is gorgeous. I think each character is a work of art. It's beautifully formed. Number two, Adelle Sans is, I would say upbeat, it's optimistic, yet it's serious enough to convey any kind of message. It has just the right amount of personality, yet not too much personality. Number three, Adelle Sans is also unusually narrow, and that actually fits email particularly well. One of my pet peeves with Gmail, which by default uses Ariel, is that the lines are as wide as your window. So if you're in a wide screen, then the lines get really arbitrarily long. The problem with really wide and really long lines, is that they decrease reading speed. Because by the time you've reached the end of one line, your eyes have lost track of the start of the next line. And Ariel itself has fairly wide characters, which further exacerbates that.

(00:36:30):
So at Superhuman we, if you've used the product, you know this, we fix the line length or the typographical measure to the optimal length for reading speed, which depending on the font is around 90 to 120 characters. And Adelle Sans is quite narrow, so it actually lets us do this on quite small windows with fairly dense line. So we get a lot of information on fairly small windows without getting a very long typographical measure, optimizing for reading speed and for comprehension. Then number four, finally Adelle Sans has very unusual treatment of the at symbol in an email address. It actually puts the base of the A in the at on the same baseline as the rest of the text.

(00:37:15):
So for example, if your name has an A, my name does Rahul at Vohra, three A's and or two A's and an at, they're all actually on the same baseline. It's a small thing, but it makes the email addresses look incredibly natural. If you look at that and then you actually look at email addresses laid out in other fonts, those other the fonts look really clunky and awkward because the A is kind of shifted around and it just looks a bit silly in my opinion. Now Adelle Sans isn't perfect. So we then worked with a type designer on some of the specific details that there are some of the glyphs, which get a little pinchy as it were, and what we use today is very close to retail Adelle Sans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):
And this was pre-launch or this was after you'd already launched?

Rahul Vohra (00:37:58):
We'd probably had about 10, 15 users at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
So I think that's pretty contrarian unique to be this focused on the font and the typeface before you even launched. This was like, "Is this even going to be a thing? Will anyone even care?" And I think this says a lot about the way you think about product.

Rahul Vohra (00:38:17):
Oh yeah, that thought never crossed my mind. I think we'll probably come to it later, but the idea that, is this never going to be a thing? I think that's a dangerous thought. We can't start thinking that way, because at what point do you stop second-guessing yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:35):
Interesting. So you were confident this was going to work, so because I am so confident it'll work, I need them to get this right. There's also this trap founders fall into of just spending too much time perfecting a thing that never works and there's always advice launch early, launch often. Thoughts there? How do you find that balance? What's your advice there?

Rahul Vohra (00:38:57):
How much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model. For example, let's say you are building a marketplace in a greenfield opportunity, so imagine the Lyft or Uber in their heyday. There's a strong network effect, because the more cars you have on your platform, the shorter waiting times are, therefore people are going to preferentially use your app versus the other person's app. That's when there's no time to spare, that's when you probably shouldn't even be sleeping. You're going to hire the most aggressive maniacal people possible. You're going to work 120-hour weeks, because every marginal minute actually does matter. Every marginal minute in the market, growing compounding is going to make your next year even better.

(00:39:51):
That's actually not true of all startups and it certainly isn't true of something like Superhuman. Yes, working harder is always better and we work tremendously hard at Superhuman, but not to the point where it made sense to release something that didn't work. I'm reminded of a story of a founder that was in Y Combinator, told me about their demo day experience. They used Mailbox, which some folks may remember was also a startup, and Dropbox famously acquired them for about a hundred million dollars. The reason that they were well known, apart from the acquisition, is they were the first to popularize, swipe to archive or swipe to mark down, which of course is now standard in Superhuman and every other app.

(00:40:43):
This founder was using Mailbox and was having an amazing demo day. They're working the room, they're meeting investors, they're pitching their photography app in this case. He went home that night and went to his laptop, fired up mailbox and sent off a bunch of follow-up emails. He waited the day, didn't hear back, he waited two days, didn't hear back. On the third morning he figured something was up, so he fired up Gmail, went to his sent mail, and you guessed it, there were no sent mails there. So something had broken with mailbox. So he's cursing to himself trying to remind himself everything's going to be okay. Sent all the same emails from Gmail manually and they all came through.

(00:41:37):
But then one of the investors said, "Hey, by the way, you might want to check your email clients, because I've been getting some of your emails twice." Now he goes back into his Gmail, he sees that yes, actually the original emails that were queued up in mailbox have now indeed been sent, and some of the investors, and unfortunately most of the investors he actually pitched twice. Now, is this the end of the world? No, an investor can overlook that. Probably a good thing that you're trying new apps. But was it horrifying and was it really scary? Absolutely.

(00:42:08):
Imagine this wasn't investors, imagine this was a customer, someone who you were trying to convince to buy your thing and that you knew what you were doing and you had attention to detail and you had everything just buttoned up and under control. Well, now you've lost face, now you look foolish. That's why when you have mission-critical products like email where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission-critical. It's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
This is such an important nuance take on, there's always this debate, how much to focus on craft and user experience, how much to focus on time to launch and get it out and speed. What I'm hearing here, which I completely agree with is, it depends on the market you're in and the criticality essentially of your product. So if it's email, it just needs to work and you need to get that right, you need to spend all the time, you need to get that right.

(00:43:03):
This reminds me of something else that when your early investors shared with me, Bill Trenchard from First-Round Capital. He talked about how speed was the thing that you just dialed up as a lever to 11. That's where you just, "We will make this the focus. Speed, speed, speed." I think maybe the lesson there is, you pick the thing that you think will most differentiate you, make you significantly better than what's out there. So just thoughts on how you decided speed was the thing you were going to obsess with, and advice for folks that are trying to decide where to dial up things to 11?

Rahul Vohra (00:43:37):
Bill is right and I agree with him, you have to pick something. Knowing what to pick is the trick. In the early days of Superhuman, I read a book on positioning that really influenced my thinking. It is, I believe called Positioning the Battle for Your Mind. It struck me how the most well-known brands have stood for one clear thing, they have a clear position. So in order for Superhuman to be memorable, I believed that we needed to occupy a clear position that was unique and which was available and which reinforced our product strategy.

(00:44:12):
In the first year of Superhuman, therefore, I interviewed hundreds of potential customers about their experience with Gmail and with Outlook. And predictably, almost everybody says that email takes way too much time. But interestingly, many people also said that Gmail and Outlook were way too slow. That was how I first thought that speed could be an interesting position for us. I then asked myself, "Is the position of speed unique and is it available?" And the answer was overwhelmingly yes, because almost no software was being sold or has ever been sold on the value proposition of speed. The last time I could remember anyone trying to do this, was when Google launched Chrome, and obviously that went incredibly well for them. You may remember they had slow-motion videos where they were comparing Chrome render webpages and showing that was faster than an actual strike of lightning. No one had done it since then.

(00:45:15):
I then asked, "Well, does speed reinforce our product strategy?" And again, the answer was overwhelmingly yes. I knew that our competition was not going to be startups, it was incumbents. And I also knew that incumbents generally struggle with speed, because by definition they have massive scale and usually entrenched architecture. Then finally I did what I call the cocktail party test, which is to look at the cocktail parties and to watch how people pitch your product to other people. In our case the pitches were simple. People would say, "Dude, you have to use it, it's really fucking fast." And that's it. That was the pitch. That's how I knew that speed would be a really great position for us to start with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:08):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:24):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema of FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:47):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. Not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:59):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:19):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's one OneSchema.co.

(00:47:33):
The next area I want to spend time on and I imagine we'll have much insight is, some of the contrarian ways you approach building Superhuman that a lot of companies never thought about doing that you did that worked out for you. So the first is manually onboarding every single new user. Sure, startups have done this, founders bring on some folks and then cool, show it to them and then they stop doing that and then it's self-service or sales teams. How far did you scale this manual onboarding phase of your company? How many people did you have onboarding people, how many people did you manually onboard?

# Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups: Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more | Dalton Caldwell (YC)

## Transcript

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:00):
Seeing everything people apply to YC with. People all have the same idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):
One of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:07):
One of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have this concept of tarpit ideas.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:17):
Seems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
Recently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:28):
We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
A lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:36):
A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Are there other patterns you find across startups that do well?

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:43):
There's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.

(00:01:50):
Why every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors.

Dalton Caldwell (00:04:45):
Yeah. Thanks so much, Lenny. I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
So to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?

Dalton Caldwell (00:05:22):
Have you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, "Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game." If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, "Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one." It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.

(00:06:33):
And so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?

Dalton Caldwell (00:07:14):
The way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?

(00:08:26):
And so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
What's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?

Dalton Caldwell (00:09:01):
I think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.

(00:09:51):
And again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, "Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time." Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Yeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, "Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?" Versus, "Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup." Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, "I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed"?

Dalton Caldwell (00:10:50):
If it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Yeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, "What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?

Dalton Caldwell (00:12:08):
That definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, "Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing." I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.

(00:13:13):
And then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
Wow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:14):
They thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, "We're going to build a new VR headset." And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
Wow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:45):
Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about." And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.

(00:15:41):
In the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, "I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it." Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):
These are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, "Oh, here's a big idea." And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...

Dalton Caldwell (00:16:38):
In the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, "We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better." And then they were like, "Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations." And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?

(00:17:30):
There was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.

Dalton Caldwell (00:17:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
A big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?

Dalton Caldwell (00:18:02):
Again, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, "Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something." When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-

Dalton Caldwell (00:19:18):
Yeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.

(00:20:29):
And they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
He did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.

Dalton Caldwell (00:20:54):
Yeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Also Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:14):
Of course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
I was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:41):
Yeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.

(00:22:37):
And so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.

(00:23:24):
A few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):
This is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?

Dalton Caldwell (00:24:10):
For people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.

(00:25:10):
If you ask your friends, "Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?" They're like, "Yeah, I would love that." You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, "Oh, we're going to fix music discovery." This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
Absolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, "How's it going?" And everyone when they used it, they're like, "Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to." And then they never use it again.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:19):
Do you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
Yeah.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:21):
Years?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
They told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:30):
Yeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
Along these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, "What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.

Dalton Caldwell (00:27:09):
Maybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, "Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no." And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. "I need feedback." That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.

(00:28:05):
And so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, "Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget." They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, "Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no." I don't think that's how this actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
I think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:00):
Yeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, "Yeah." If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Specifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:25):
I think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.

(00:30:34):
And again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
It makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-

Dalton Caldwell (00:30:57):
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):
I think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?

Dalton Caldwell (00:31:32):
Yeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, "Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky." You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, "Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to..." And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):
Fair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?

Dalton Caldwell (00:32:35):
I don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton." And then two years later they're like, "Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up." So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):
To make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. "Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google." And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, "Oh wow, everything went wrong." It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
How do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?

Dalton Caldwell (00:34:39):
I think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.

Dalton Caldwell (00:36:54):
Oh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):
I think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?

Dalton Caldwell (00:37:23):
I completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, "Yeah, we're failing." I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, "We got one more move in us. We got one more try." You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.

(00:38:17):
And so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, "Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore." And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, "I don't want to do this anymore." And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
That is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:16):
Yeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, "I'm done." If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
And you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:41):
I would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, "Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in." And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):
That is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, "Talk to customers. Build things they want." Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, "Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars." Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?

Dalton Caldwell (00:40:57):
Yeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool." And I'm like, "Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?" And they're like, "Well." And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.

(00:41:49):
And you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, "Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers." Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, "Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag."

(00:42:51):
The whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):
When someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:17):
Yeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):
That's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:51):
Yeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
Makes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?

### How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)

# How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)

## Transcript

Elizabeth Stone (00:00:00):
We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density. And in some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. And in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior.

Lenny (00:01:06):
Today my guest is Elizabeth Stone. Elizabeth is chief technology officer at Netflix, and as far as I can tell, the first economist to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company. Prior to this role, Elizabeth was vice president of Data and Insights. Before Netflix, she was vice president of science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst Group. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. We talk about how an economics background has helped Elizabeth in her career and why she expects to see more economists rise in the ranks of tech companies. She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly at so many companies so consistently. We delve into Netflix's very unique culture of high talent density, radical candor, and freedom and responsibility. We also talk about the structure that Netflix has for their data and user research teams, which she believes is a part of Netflix's secret to success. We also get into what biking and triathlons have taught Elizabeth about life and how she brings that into her work and so much more.

(00:04:36):
Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Elizabeth Stone (00:04:41):
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:04:43):
So when we booked this conversation, you are VP of data in Netflix. And since then you got a promotion, you're now the CTO of Netflix, which feels significantly more fancy. Question for you, what is life like now that you are CTO versus VP of data? How is it most different? I'm imagining more meetings.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:01):
I would say the biggest thing that changed is probably the amount of context switching and the degree to which I feel behind or I have a lot to learn. And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the VP of data and insights role that I was in before in part because we cover a lot of different areas of the business and there's always people to learn from, but the engineering organization just takes that to 100 basically. So more people to get to know, more problem spaces, aspects of technical expertise that I'm just not as deeply familiar with. And yeah, a lot more meetings.

Lenny (00:05:41):
I imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:44):
Yes. So thankfully not a lot of meetings that Netflix feel like now you're really in this scary room, but it does feel like the role has more consequence, which is actually an exciting thing.

Lenny (00:05:57):
Kind along the lines of what you just talked about being a CTO. Your background is actually unusual. You're a trained economist, you got a PhD in economics. And from what I can tell, you're the first CTO of Fortune 500 company that is an economist trained in economics. First of all, is that true? I don't know if I think that's true, but you tell me.

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:16):
I have not checked the list. That was one of the things I did not do after getting the title. It might be unusual. I've heard a lot of feedback on that, so I don't know if I'm the one and only, but I will definitely say it's probably unusual.

Lenny (00:06:30):
Yeah. So I guess the question is just, do you think this is an anomaly and going to continue to be really rare? Do you think this some are going to see more at tech companies? And generally do you think tech companies should hire more economists?

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:41):
Yes to the last question. That's the easiest of it. But one of the things I observed even with the focus on data science where I've been deeper for a period of time is that economics is a flavor of data science. So it is a set of technical skills for sure. It's a way of framing certain problems or solving challenges.

(00:07:06):
And so when I was first switching from economics into tech, it was before there was a lot of sort of the frenzy around data science that we've seen more recently and it was harder to make that argument that economics is a flavor of data science and maybe complimentary to other versions of data science. And I feel more strongly about that now that I've seen it up close. And so maybe by extension I would say just like I think data science can be helpful for a lot of different problems that you might not immediately think, "Oh, this is something that we should bring data to," I think that economics is generally valuable for a lot of different challenges and it's a useful perspective to add to things, especially in a business context and especially in how we want to simplify problems in a way that makes them feel tractable.

(00:08:00):
So I feel like that's been a benefit to me to have had that type of formal training and then bring that perspective or way of thinking to different roles. And so I don't know that many people at Netflix think of me as an economist, but I find it comes out in the way I think about things. So to the extent that that's true generally, I think it's useful in a lot of companies. And I feel like even since I made the switch towards tech, I've seen it become much, much more common to think about the value of having economists on teams.

Lenny (00:08:32):
Just to pull on that thread a little bit more, is there something very tactical or concrete that you can share that you find helpful with that background that you found helpful in your career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:08:42):
Other than the dismal dry science of it all? So one example would probably be in an understanding incentives and thinking about unintended consequences. I think that that is true both in terms of internal leadership, so being part of a management team that's thinking about how do we clarify priorities or motivate a company or define the problems we want to solve. And then part of it is more externally oriented. How do we want to think about what Netflix is to consumers and how we want to think about competition?

(00:09:24):
There can be a rational way of thought, which is one version of economics of shouldn't rational intelligent people behave in the following way. And then there's the, well, if given certain incentives, what might you see that we didn't think was optimal or we weren't expecting to happen but could be a consequence or repercussion here? And so I think that that type of framing, I don't know if it's unique to economics in a way because it has elements of psychology to it as well and planning ahead has become really useful for thinking through cause and effect. So that has come up in a lot of different spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've been in.

Lenny (00:10:08):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and looking at your career over the years. It seems like you've had a meteoric rise at four different companies. And I'll just walk through them briefly. So at your first job, you went from associate to vice president in three years. At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager of data science to COO in two years. At Netflix you went from VP to CTO in three years. I think that's really rare. I'm curious what is your secret sauce to being so successful at so many places and especially in the context of what advice can you share with folks earlier in their career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:10:46):
This is one of those questions that sparks the reflection that I wouldn't normally do, so that's great. I really don't think of it as a secret sauce, but maybe I can walk through some of the things that I think have been instrumental. As you listed that out, it sounds like the two to three year point is the real sweet spot, so maybe there's something about that timeline. But I think some things almost feel trite in how I would say them, which is I'm very dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm part of. It's been part who I am for a long time that I give everything I've got to the job that I'm in. And I think that dedication and that I get joy out of that has mattered. It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing. I do the best work I possibly can, less so for myself and my own ambition and more so because I think of myself as being part of a team and so I really need to deliver for that team.

(00:11:52):
I think that framing in my mind and that motivation has helped me in a few fronts, which is the way in which I build partnerships with people I work with that I really care about setting other people up for success and being someone that people want to work with, so I learn from them, they learn from me, and we get better outcomes for the business together, I have found that part of that is being someone that people can leverage to translate from technical to non-technical and non-technical to technical. So that I do think has been a relative advantage in my role. So while I was often sitting in more technically-oriented teams, a lot of the advancement in my career was to roles that required that type of communication fluency. It grew out of being able to partner with people across the businesses who didn't necessarily have the same background, but where we needed to really connect spaces so that we could be more effective.

(00:12:57):
That was something that I think really the training for that came from analysis group where it was a very quantitative set of work that we had to find a way to communicate to judges and juries for economic cases. So that was something that was trained in other roles and I think I've been able to leverage. I'm a relatively introverted only child, so I observe a lot, which means that I learned from other people. And in each of these roles I have tried really hard to watch what other people are doing, think about how could I learn something from them, whether it's the thing that I want to be able to do myself or it's the thing that I think, "Oh, that doesn't quite fit or feel authentic with my style." And I do a lot of that introspection. So I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation and then have been able to leverage that to be stronger in the roles I was sitting in.

Lenny (00:14:00):
I took a few notes here. A few things you mentioned is just like, dedication, essentially working really hard and taking your work seriously, being part of a team and setting other people up for success, translating complex tech language and problems to non-tech people, and then being really good at observing and learning from other people around you. Is there an example or two that you could share of some of these to make it even more concrete for people? Like dedication. Is that just like working many hours, being part of a team? Anything along those lines to share a story maybe to help people put this into practice.

Elizabeth Stone (00:14:35):
No, and it's a good clarification because the dedication piece really isn't about long working hours. It's more about how much I care about excellence, I guess. So giving it my best in those situations. And that might not mean that I work really wild hours or I work weekends or I'm the one who's willing to sacrifice the vacation. I've actually tried to avoid setting that as an expectation, but more that I hold myself to a very high standard.

(00:15:13):
So an example would be, especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me. So whether it's the timing for a meeting or providing input on something or reviewing a document or following through on something I said that I was going to do, and I really try to avoid that, which means that if someone sends me something, I try to be very responsive about it. If I know that I said I'm going to do something, I follow through on it in the timeline that I said I was going to do. If I have a meeting, I try to be on time to that meeting.

(00:16:01):
Those are all flavors of dedication to the work that show up in, "Oh, it seems like Elizabeth works really hard," but the motivation factor is other people are relying on me and I want to show up for them. And so that's when I say dedication and it's related to the second point around showing up well for the team, those would all be examples of I feel urgency in responding to people and doing high quality work.

(00:16:27):
For the other parts of technical to non-technical, I think a great example is actually a very timely one at Netflix, which is, we are making strides to offer live content types. So live events, live TV shows. We announced this week that we're going to be hosting WWE starting later this year and early next year, 2025. That is easier said than done. I know that there's a lot of entertainment companies that have live content. But Netflix has really been in the streaming content business, so live content is something new for us and it's something that's going to require a really close partnership between our content organization and our products and technology organization because there's a content strategy to it, there's a business strategy, there's a technology strategy to it. A big part of my role is, can I explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds competence with the content team? Can I try to understand their content strategy in a way that sets the technical teams up for success and we understand what we need to be able to deliver on here in terms of requirements.

(00:17:46):
I don't think I'd be able to do my current role well if I wasn't able to do that type of translation for something that's going to be a big bet for the business and something we want to invest in jointly. And then to set my partners up for success in that. So I am going to do everything I can to make sure we deliver well for my content partners because I feel like that's what's best for Netflix in the business.

Lenny (00:18:09):
Amazing examples. In terms of life content, I think about the Love is Blind. I think it was for premier, whatever, reunion that we got sucked into that show. So good job. And I think there were some issues with that, right? That reunion streak.

Elizabeth Stone (00:18:24):
Well, yeah, that was about a little less than a year ago now. So the amazing thing about failure is you learn a lot. We learned a lot. We've taken notes on it and we had a couple successful events after that, including the Netflix Cup last October. And we've got some exciting events coming up. So I think that's something that strengthened us, but did reveal that we're tackling a hard problem.

Lenny (00:18:50):
Yeah, the Twitter feeds during that, Love is Blind premiere were hilarious. People are pissed.

(00:18:57):
Okay. And then in terms of the, keeping a high bar for yourself, I love that. I think about a quote that... There's a VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate and she did this interview with Tim Ferris. She shared that her dad always asked her, "Are you doing a World-class job with this? Are you doing a world-class job with your homework? Are you doing a world-class job with your piano recital?" And that's the bar that he always had for her. And I feel like that's a really good way to think about work and life in general if you can.

Elizabeth Stone (00:19:28):
Yeah, my mother used to describe to me, probably still does, though it required more repeating when I was younger, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered. And so it is that framing of the extra effort you put into something to make it world-class or to make it excellent. And so I do like to push myself that way and I hope it sets a good example for other people too. It's very consistent with especially the company cultures that I tend to thrive in where that's the general expectation of the culture. So you don't feel like you're doing it alone, because then I think you can start to feel frustrated by that.

Lenny (00:20:15):
I know that this is a big part of Netflix culture and I want to get into it. But before that, I'm curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in this skill of having a really high bar? And an example I'll give as you think about maybe an example is the way I described this to my PMs was, you want to have this aura that you've got this that, "If you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I feel like this thread will not disappear. He won't drop this ball." Is there anything that you've learned as a good way to help someone learn this kind of skill, understand why this is so important?

Elizabeth Stone (00:20:53):
It shows up for the people who report to me, is one part example setting. So if I don't do it, why would they do it? I treat that very seriously that we should all be held to the same standards.

(00:21:12):
And as a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard. So I think one of the things I've observed especially with people on my teams is that the expectations aren't always clear and you can't assume that they're clear if you don't share them. When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I am expecting or to show up in the way that I'm expecting.

(00:21:55):
And then the third and probably most important thing is help them fill that gap. So that would mean... Let's take an example. It certainly has happened frequently in many jobs. A document is okay, it's not great, it's not going to be easy for people to follow, it's not as crisp as it could be. There's things that would strengthen it. I can both give the feedback on that to make sure like, yes, it's going to take another round of iteration, yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it, but pushing people to get there, and then jumping into the document and helping.

(00:22:32):
So I feel very strongly about, and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example of like, "Let's work on this together," and then through that, help people uplevel themselves so the next time around they know the expectations and they've had help getting there in the past. So that's probably happened a thousand times in my career where I jump in with both feet because something needs to be better and I think the teams are better for it afterwards, or I hope they are.

Lenny (00:23:00):
I think that's such a good framework just to kind of mirror back what you said, "Set expectations that the bar is going to be really high and here's what I'm expecting from you." Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them fill that gap. I think a lot of people may feel this and hear this and they're like, "Oh man, I don't want a manager that's like this high of an expectation person and it just feels really stressful." But I've had these managers and I feel like that's when I've learned the most and leveled up the most, is having someone that had really high expectations and then helped me understand, "Here's where you're not doing as well as you can. I know you can do better. Go back and work on this." I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice it ends up helping you most in your career. I imagine you've seen a similar result.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:45):
I think so. I mean you'd have to ask some of the people on my team. So I might look at it differently that they look at it.

Lenny (00:23:51):
[inaudible 00:23:52] differences.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:53):
It's a hard skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like you know someone's put a lot of effort into something. And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver that feedback so it feels like we're on the same team and I'm trying to help them be successful, not to help encourage failure. And that's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping in to help can make people feel like, "I'm in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful. My manager's helping me here." I do often do that behind the scenes. So maybe that's another flavor of this, which is, I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of all the people where the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer space to say, "Here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time." So it gives people a little grace and a little bit of an ability to absorb that feedback without feeling like it's kind of on a stage.

Lenny (00:25:02):
Another thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is like, "Oh my god, it's going to take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with." And I know you said that this doesn't mean necessarily many hours. Do you have any advice or thoughts on just how to avoid burnout and working all the time, but also keeping this really high bar and high expectations?

Elizabeth Stone (00:25:21):
It truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying, "If we're clear on the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time. So if we're going to come together to talk through..." Like quarterly business review was the example, what were the highlights? What were the low lights? What were the learnings from the quarter? Where are there places of misalignment? The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going, to have a debate about things where maybe we're stuck. It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation.

(00:26:08):
So my feedback in that instance would be, I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about what's the conversation we really want to have? "How do I tee that up?" Not, "Could I spend another 20 hours to make it look like everything's perfect in this document?" And so I think in that sense it's not just excellence, like you wrote the perfect document, I should probably be careful to not use that as the only example, but instead we really got to the outcome we wanted to get to because we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot of energy and time and iteration into making sure we got to that outcome.

Lenny (00:26:43):
And is this an example where you gave someone feedback that they spent too much time on the polish or is this earlier? And to give the pyramid of this framework you kind of shared of set expectations, give specific feedback, help them fill the gap and then do it in private, is this the expectation setting in this example or is this feedback you spend too much time on this?

Elizabeth Stone (00:27:01):
This is expectation setting. So one of the things in my new role is that there's some practices that the team has had where they're trying to understand, Are we still going to have those practices? What's going to be the same versus different about those things?" and get an understanding of my expectations. So it's great that people ask that question so that I can be clear about, "Oh wait, if you're on the last 20% of this polishing the dock, I'd rather spend time over here. And here's how I would like the conversation to go so we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like it's just a leadership reviewer on my behalf." So in this specific situation, it was setting expectations ahead of time so that we can set everyone up for success.

Lenny (00:27:44):
Awesome. Okay. So we've kind of been talking around this, but this is an important part of the Netflix culture. Just broadly, Netflix has a really special and unique culture. Even though it's been around for I think over 25 years now, it feels like the culture has come up many times. There's that initial culture deck that came out that blew everyone's minds. There's a recent book, No Rules Rules I think it's called. And it feels like Netflix has done a great job at maintaining its culture.

(00:28:10):
It feels to me there's these three important elements, and maybe there's more. One is very high talent density and a focus on high performers. Two is candor and being really direct. And then three is giving people freedom and responsibility and getting rid of useless processes like vacation time and things like that. So maybe just to dive into that first one of high talent density and this focus on high performance. I guess the question there is just like, what does this look like in Netflix? And I imagine part of it is hiring, part of it is performance reviews. And then just why is it so important? Why is this such a focus on Netflix? What happens when you have such a high talent density?

Elizabeth Stone (00:28:51):
It's just so intrinsic to who Netflix is as a company. And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes and that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.

(00:29:37):
A big piece of that talent density is definitely hiring. So who are the people coming in and joining the team? But a lot of it is, we can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density.

(00:30:03):
And so in some ways it's not the end, it's the means to the end in what Reed and the rest of the leadership team has been trying to build. And so in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback, this gets into the second bucket. So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations when they're not being met, what could be better in helping people improve, and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high? Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being and stays a perfect human being the whole time. We all have ways that we could grow and improve. And so in order to keep that bar high, you have to be willing to have those types of very uncomfortable conversations. It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback in order to keep that bar high.

(00:31:10):
And then the other piece of it is another thing that doesn't come naturally to humans, which is making a call in pretty timely fashion if someone's not able to meet the bar, and to say either, "I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role, or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you," and to make that something that is part of best practice to get to a point where you could make that decision. And that's where we refer to the keepers test, which is really just a mental framing to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this. Where if I'm asking myself the question, "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?" If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, "Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?", if I might be a little bit relieved if you said you were leaving.

(00:32:20):
The reason the keeper test and that question is useful is because no one wants to think that way. It's very hard to say to someone, "I think this isn't the right fit. I think you should move on from the company." So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior. And we also then want to get to a place where when you're having that tough conversation, people aren't surprised by it. That is easier said than done. But you can only get to that conversation around, "I don't think Netflix and you are the right fit for one another" if you've been giving feedback along the way. And so it feels like in its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation. In practice, it's not always that smooth. Obviously we are humans. But that all feeds on itself in order to make sure that we're really holding ourselves to what we say our behavioral norms as part of the culture.

Lenny (00:33:17):
How is that operationalized? Is that just mental model that you should have in mind? Or is it like every quarter you should go through this exercise? Is it part of the performance review process? How does that actually operationalize at Netflix?

Elizabeth Stone (00:33:29):
It's definitely a mental model. So when we talk to managers about what does it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would mean you should be with some frequency asking yourself this about the people on your team. People ask me frequently, "Am I passing your keeper test?" So it becomes part of a regular manager direct report, one on one. And it is just another way of saying, "Am I meeting your expectations? What's going well? What's not going well? How are you thinking about things?" And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have. So in the middle of a lot of like, "We have to talk about this project or that deliverable or this thing that's happening," to take the time to step back and just say, "How am I doing?", can feel loaded sometimes. And the keeper test, while it feels like a very heavy concept, creates a lightness around being able to have that conversation regularly. So we do operationalize it. A point that you made, I'll just clarify, we don't have performance reviews.

Lenny (00:34:33):
Oh, wow.

Elizabeth Stone (00:34:34):
So we don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we would think about reflecting on a rating of how things are going. We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from a lot of people, but it's not an input to some output, it's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle. And we have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how are people doing? And so you think about performance as part of both promotions and as part of compensation, but in that way it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Interesting. I didn't know that. So the idea there is just ongoing, like the whole... So what many people dream of, no performance reviews, we'll give you ongoing real-time feedback. We don't have to wait six months. I feel like people talk about this but rarely do this, but that's how you guys operate.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:36):
In ideal.

Lenny (00:35:37):
In ideal, yeah.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:38):
In practice. It's like you have to keep reminding yourself, "This is our ideal" because it's really easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle. And all of a sudden I do get about 300 pieces of feedback. And some of those things are on things that happened six months ago and I think, "Oh, I wish you had told me this at the time, that would've been more living the Netflix culture." So we have to push ourselves to do it that way. But yeah, that is if working well, it's very timely direct feedback. The 360 site goal is sort of the annual check-in on, "Let me get the full picture. Let me be able to distill some themes. Let me tee it up for a conversation with my manager." And then it does remove the sort of crutch of an every six month performance review or something like that.

Lenny (00:36:31):
When you talked about this example of someone asking you often, "Am I meeting your keeper test?", it makes me feel like someone's just super nervous. They're like, "Am I passing your keeper test?" And it makes me feel like it could create a culture of just like a lot of stress and worry and this hunger games mentality of like, "I got to compete and worry and I might die or get fired any day." I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural. This is just the way we work. You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this keeper test. How do you avoid this just constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you may not be hitting the bar?

Elizabeth Stone (00:37:08):
In my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations than by not having them. So in many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or things I could be doing better on, and I didn't quite know how to get that information. And that made me feel much more stressed or nervous or at risk than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations.

(00:37:45):
So the thing that I think can be nerve wracking, and I feel it myself, is the high bar for excellence at Netflix and if we're doing this while you're surrounded by amazing people. And that can feed a sense of, "Am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else is doing? I know the bar's high." For the most part, that can drive people and in a good way, but in some ways it makes people nervous. And that's where I think it's helpful to know we expect to have these conversations so you can just kind of let your shoulders relax a little bit of, "Yes, the expectations are high, but my manager says I'm doing a great job, or my manager says I'm not doing a great job, but they gave me concrete things that I could do better." And so I think knowing is better than not. And so in that sense, it's the culture combined with the conversations around performance I hope take a little bit of that stress out of it. But I've certainly heard it a lot that without that conversation, people can be nervous.

Lenny (00:38:49):
That's such a good point and such a good example that I feel like every company wants to have a high bar and have only high performers and keep the bar really high for every person they hire. I'm curious, I know this could be its own podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring people that are amazing and keeping this bar of excellence, is there anything you can point out that might be helpful to other companies hiring to help identify amazing people and make sure that bar stays high? One thing I know is you guys pay a top market for salary. I think that's one unique thing about Netflix, is we just pay people. So maybe that's an part of this answer, but just what advice do you have for people to keep a really high bar in their talent?

Elizabeth Stone (00:39:33):
Yeah, I mean on the compensation point, we pay what we call personal top of market, meaning we want to be highly competitive in the pay, but we don't want pay to be like the golden handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than paying people a strongly competitive compensation. So I think that that's important for attracting and retaining talent and has been a big part of the culture, but almost more importantly, we hope we don't have to rely on that to want people to want to be at Netflix or for us to be able to assess whether people are going to thrive at Netflix.

(00:40:20):
The way that I've thought about hiring with that context is we know we're going to offer you very highly competitive compensation, but are you going to come to Netflix and help us identify the right problems to solve or new ways to solve existing problems? And that's a different way of hiring than you might think about, especially at scale where you're saying, "Does this person have this skill, this skill, this skill? Check they're going to fit in this box and they're going to deliver this work that I need them to do." I'm being intentionally simplistic. I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually that way. But at Netflix we try really hard to say we're looking for the new perspective or the person who's actually going to make us stronger as a team. So thinking about additive skills, additive perspectives, people who are going to push our thinking on something. That tends to help us with thinking about talent density because you're constantly introducing people to the team who uplevel.

(00:41:25):
So then the questions you have to ask in an interview might be different because yes, we're trying to assess do you have the baseline skills to be successful here, but we're also looking for the things that make people exceptional or even stronger than the team we've got. And then you think about making the magical teams comprised of all those amazing minds and what can you get out of that. And that feels like more that the talent density and practice.

Lenny (00:41:50):
Got it. So the advice there essentially is, don't look for someone just simply great. Look for someone that raises the bar for the whole team, brings in a whole new perspective.

Elizabeth Stone (00:41:58):
Yes. That's a great way to say it. Yeah, it's a good way to say it.

Lenny (00:42:00):
I think what's great about this idea of just maintaining excellence consistently is that the best people want to work with the best people. And as soon as there's one person that sucks and the company allows for that, it just brings everyone down because they know, "Hey, we can be okay. We'll stick or no one's going to do anything about it." And when you make it clear, we only want the best and only hire the best and only keep the best, it keeps the best there, right? I imagine that's part of the strategy.

Elizabeth Stone (00:42:29):
Yeah. It's definitely the goal. And I think understanding that having gaps in the team and people's skillsets or their behavior can be really toxic for other people on the team. So it's a cost.

(00:43:54):
So I asked on Twitter what questions to ask you. And there's a great question that came in from Nan Yu. He's the head of product for Linear and he asks, "What practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do because their talent level is so much higher than other companies?"

Elizabeth Stone (00:44:15):
That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell. So let me explain that. It's a good question. It's kind of related to what I was saying earlier, that talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate. So if we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems or the scope of problems that they could tackle, assuming they're highly impactful for the business, and we don't have a lot of process around that work, so think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation, we get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore and question things and experiment in a way with solutions. I think that that would be very hard if not dangerous if we didn't have a high talent density.

(00:45:32):
It's really not a top down do A, then B, then C. Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or thinking about how we think about priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team and that requires talent density. And then there's things like you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders experience. We do give people a lot of responsibility on those things. So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on we've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment.

Lenny (00:46:18):
This is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice is, "Just hire amazing people, get out of their way and let them do their job," which is often not a successful experience. What are examples that either things that came out of this freedom, I don't know, products or features or ideas that came out of this or policies or processes you don't have that everyone else might have? So I know there's no vacation time, there's unlimited vacation time, I assume. Is that still a thing? Unlimited vacation time?

Elizabeth Stone (00:46:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:49):
Okay, cool. All right, great. And I know performance reviews, you talked about that. So I guess in either direction, is there an example of something that came out of this freedom or some process that which surprised people that you don't have or a framework or system?

Elizabeth Stone (00:47:05):
We've been able to deliver... I'll speak to my own team around innovations in our content delivery network or innovations in encoding or innovations in discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, "I think this is a priority." They were driven in many cases by individual contributors who had great ideas for innovation. So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded in, came from creating space for people on the team. So there's probably thousands of examples of product features and things like that that came out of creating this space. And right now, the trick is finding the sweet spot so that we can operate efficiently at this type of scale without snuffing out some of that, what was kind of the core beauty of the culture.

Lenny (00:47:55):
Maybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit. I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, "Oh wow, that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor."

Elizabeth Stone (00:48:15):
There's a couple things that come to mind. I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well. And in practice, that means I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes it's just letting people know, "Here's what leadership's talking about so that they have a sense of what's top of mind." But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about, doesn't exist a lot of other places. I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share... I can't always share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that probably push the boundary a little bit in the team, feeling like they understand what's happening across the company and what I'm thinking about.

(00:49:22):
And then there's a second example that comes to mind, which is, until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix. So all engineers were just senior engineers, all data scientists were senior data scientists, and we did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago almost exactly. And it was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred of it. A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions. This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews, because promotions really weren't at play. And it gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry about that type of structure. But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type of scaffolding to say, "We want to talk about how we compose teams. When do we need the person who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad?" Because that's what the work requires. We didn't have a language for it.

(00:50:27):
So I introduced Levels a couple of years ago and we had quite a change rollercoaster is the only way I can describe how it went.

Lenny (00:50:38):
That's a good phrase.

Elizabeth Stone (00:50:40):
Yeah, it was sort of like being the tumble dry machine for a few months, and so really talking through it with the team. That's just context and backdrop. For an example of candor recently, which is, we had kind of a postmortem or a retro on how has it gone with IC levels. So it's kind of like wells, not wells. And I would normally think in a lot of cultures it would be like, "Well, we got past that change. We're living that change." Don't reflect on it. Because that kind of opened some of that early debate. And I felt differently about it. I think it's a good example of being candid about, this was a big change for us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better in how we implement levels at Netflix. And I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and we achieved every objective. So I think that I try to build examples like that because I do think that level of candor and reflection helps build the sense of community and trust across the team.

Lenny (00:51:44):
That's an awesome example. Kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom and responsibility, something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this idea of Chaos Monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure that just kills random processes and things and just to see what breaks and make sure things are stable when things actually start falling apart. Is Chaos Monkeys... Was that what it's called? And then is that still a thing? Is there still some Chaos Monkeys running around the servers?

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:19):
Not unbridled Chaos Monkeys. No.

Lenny (00:52:22):
Okay. Contains chaos and niche.

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:24):
Bur no, we carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member experience to inject pain, though we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience, and that does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than B. And so that happens across engineering systems really at scale. But it is not for pure chaos, it's for intentional learning and so we can avoid making bigger mistakes. And then as we go into new efforts like cloud games, we have a beta that's out now, Live would be another example. We do try to come up with intentionally low profile examples where we can test the bounds of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience. But that's less randomness, more by design. And so we're doing that in a few places that feels mostly good engineering practice so we can understand when it's really showtime and we're going to really test our systems, will they be able to perform like we want them to.

Lenny (00:53:42):
RIP Chaos Monkey.

Elizabeth Stone (00:53:45):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:47):
So kind of along these lines of data, so data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix. My understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful. And that's the team you led before you moved into this new role. Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective?

Elizabeth Stone (00:54:14):
Yeah. I certainly like to think of it as being special. It's unusual. I can explain why. So the scale of company that Netflix now is very often data oriented teams are embedded in other parts of the business. So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they are organized more functionally separating data engineers from data scientists, from analytics engineers, from consumer researchers. We've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse. So across all those types of functions that I just described and works on nearly every area of the business from within the team. I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this because it really does require basically extraordinary partnership that we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that are relying on them.

(00:55:30):
But the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise. So are we really world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists? And how do we continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective? It gives people better career paths because there's more mobility across the teams. It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems to solve. And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way.

# Lessons from working with 600+ YC startups | Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator, Airbnb)

## Transcript

Gustaf Alströmer (00:00:00):
If I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is like it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Gustaf Alstromer. Gustaf is a group partner at Y Combinator where he's been for almost six years. Prior to that, Gustaf was at Airbnb for over four years where he started the original Airbnb growth team and where I was very lucky to get to work alongside him for a number of years. Gustaf is also at the heart of YC's increased focus on climate tech, and in my opinion is one of a handful of people who've had an incredible impact on the increasing amount of investment and people flowing into climate tech.

(00:01:10):
We chat in depth about what's happening in climate tech, why things have shifted so much recently, what's new and exciting, and how to think about the space if you're hoping to make the jump. We also get deep into Gustaf's experience working with over 600 startups over his time at YC. We talk about what are the most common mistakes that early stage startups and founders make, what advice YC partners give founders most often, the most common attributes of successful founders, the importance of having a technical co-founder and why that's the case, so much more. I guarantee you will leave this episode smarter and more inspired and I can't wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Gustaf Alstromer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:01:53):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you? What does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear is designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress, and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large established companies such as Vercel, Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:03:02):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools while trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at getepo.com. Get, E-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:04:15):
Gustaf, welcome to the podcast.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:04:17):
Thank you, Lenny. Honestly, it's so great to see you. I'm excited to be talking to you.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a while ever since we booked this. We worked together at Airbnb for many years. I was really lucky to get to work with you before you moved on to bigger and better things at YC. Speaking of Airbnb, you once tweeted about how special an experience that was for you, and I think even more interestingly, how many of the people that have left Airbnb can't find another place that's as special that just like that bar has been set too high. And so my first question is just like, what do you think it was that made Airbnb so special? Why was it such an important experience for you and other people? And even more importantly, just what is it that you take from that experience that you bring to startups that you work with now?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:02):
Yeah, it's funny. I think this year in a couple of months it'll be 10 years ago since you and me started Airbnb.

Lenny (00:05:07):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:08):
It was 2012. The reason I treated that was I asked everyone that I'd met after Airbnb, because I had this experience of like, this was the highlight of my career up until then, at least being in the team like that and I asked everyone, "Have you found anything better?" Besides maybe one or two people, I haven't heard anybody say that they found something better. And they all missed that dearly. I thought a lot about why that was the case, but I would say Airbnb did not feel like a normal job. It felt like more like a group of friends trying to just do something together and we were friends. At least in the beginning it did not feel like this was a job. It was sort of like an ongoing project and an assembly of amazing people. I think in the end we managed to build two things, like a really successful company, thanks to Joe and Nate and Brian just for starting this. Without them there would be nothing to build.

(00:06:04):
I think people don't like to use the word family, but I feel like that way because when I go and meet with Airbnb alumnis from that team. We have a very special bond that reminds me of close social connections more than anything else. It does not remind me of coworkers. I asked myself why this was the case. The best answer I have is probably we brought in a special type of people. We had very diverse backgrounds. A lot of us was former founders. Not many of us were career people from the technology industry of the early days, not many of us.

(00:06:37):
I think that bar that we set, the first, I believe when I joined there was probably five or seven PMs and there was 30 engineers or something and you joined a little bit before me, those people set the bar or set the standard of what we were looking for afterwards. I think it took a long time to change that narrative. I mean, eventually you have to hire people that only had big corporation careers, but I don't remember we did that for a long time. When I actually read my goodbye note recently, my words there still means a lot to me and it means sort of like you're trying to reflect on exactly these things on like, building a great company that became successful and being part of this sort of family of really close friends.

Lenny (00:07:21):
So it sounds like if you had to boil down what Airbnb did, it sounds like hiring was the main piece that impacted the way it turned out just like the founders being very specific about the type of people they were hiring.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Is there anything that's like, I don't know, a take away there of just what you recommend to founders, like hiring. People know, be very careful who you hire. The first, I don't know, 10 people will impact the culture long term. But I don't know. Is there anything just abstracting away there of just what to look for in that first batch of hires?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:50):
It's a tricky one because I would like to say that all the things that we did were the cost of the outcome of this, but that's not really how the world works. Some of the things we did work, some of the things that we did did not work. It's hard for us to actually disentangle what those things are, but I think we can talk about the things that we did. First of all, we made sure we hired people that were really excited to be there, right? They wanted to build Airbnb and they were really excited to work on Airbnb. That was the most important thing. Of course people had other offers, but I think you can figure out from those offers are you excited to be here or not. So that was probably the first thing.

(00:08:30):
The second thing I think is trying to understand the true motivations of the people that were there, like lower, "Why are you here?" We did something we call culture interviews that I think the founders have written about or there's probably content online about this. We did a lot of culture interviews early on to try to figure out we got the people that were there that mapped our core values and were really excited to work on Airbnb. I think finally, I don't know how this happened, we did pick people from diverse backgrounds. Most startups don't have most of the PMs being former founders, but I believe that was the case for the first 10 or 12 or 15 PMs at Airbnb. A lot of us were former founders. I think that that made a big difference for how you make decisions and how you get started on things.

(00:09:21):
I think I actually see this a lot in the Airbnb founders. They really care about the time at YC and they tried to recreate YC inside Airbnb a couple of times with demo day and with so new products completely isolated from the rest, starting with doing things that don't scale and talking to customers. So I think that that experience had made a big impact on them, but it's hard to say just these two things go and apply these things. It's actually kind of hard to say, "Well that will work at it as Airbnb." I think that's a really tricky question to answer.

(00:09:51):
The last thing I would say is Airbnb had an incredible business model, an incredible business from early on and it was hard to fail. What I mean by that is it's hard to fail with a company. You can fail with individual things inside the company, but a company was still going to succeed. I think we all felt that. A lot of companies don't have the ability to take risks like Airbnb did early on because they don't have something that's so obviously great.

Lenny (00:10:18):
That's a really interesting point on the last piece that you may have the most amazing culture and hire incredibly well, but if the company doesn't work out, it's not going to be looked back as like, "Wow, that was an amazing experience, but we failed."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:10:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:30):
Yeah, that's interesting. So you mentioned YC and this kind of is a good segue to where I want to focus most of our time. You mentioned that you've worked with over 600 companies at this point, which is absurd. It feels like it's you get some statistical significance on takeaways at this point of what works and doesn't work. So I have just a bunch of questions about your experience working at YC and with all these companies. The first is I think about this quote that Elad Gill tweeted once and he wrote, I think, a post about it. Elad Gill is a legendary angel investor. He said that starting a company is an act of desperation. You're either desperate to change the trajectory of your career or you're desperate to make a bunch of money, you're desperate to achieve some kind of mission or build a specific product that you're just like, "I need this to exist." I'm curious if you agree with that sentiment and then I have a follow-up question around that.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:11:20):
Yeah, actually I haven't heard it before, but you know me, I'm an optimistic person. I think it probably reflects on my view of this question, but I would say desperation sounds like a negative place that you're starting at. I actually think that most people to start companies start from a positive place. But the motivations, I agree with what he said, can be very diverse for successful founders, right?

(00:11:41):
So we actually asked this in one of the early Group Office Hours sessions. We asked them, "Why are you doing this?" And we don't want to hear an answer like, "I found this niche of the market.' That's not the why. The why is like, "Why will you come in and work late after four years when you have no money left and everything's going to shit?", right? Then the niche market is not the answer. There's something deeper than that. We've learned that it varies a lot for people's motivations to start companies. Some of them just want to solve some technical problem that they feel are passionate about solving. Some of them want to prove themselves in front of others or prove themselves towards themselves. Some have grand really important motivations to change the world and they will say things like, "I want to give everyone water or I want to solve climate change or I want to democratize publishing." You can imagine any number of large ideas. Some people just want to start a big company and just want to be successful.

(00:12:44):
It doesn't matter, in my experience, what your motivation is. I don't think either of these motivations. It sounds like some of them will be better than others. In my experience, it's not the case. The motivation will change over time to just running this thing, right? Like once something becomes big, it's hard to think every day about exactly why you got started because the motivation is just like it can be fun and work on boring things because it's fun to build something big. Everything doesn't have to be shiny and big and grandiose because there are many ideas that are "boring," but just the idea of running the company becomes the motivation eventually.

Lenny (00:13:17):
That is really interesting that one of the main things you look for, it sounds like when you're interviewing, is how strong and durable is that drive to build this company. Is that what you're saying?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:13:26):
It's actually kind of hard for screen for motivation, I would say, in interviews because the purpose of this kind of Office Hour question is to highlight why someone is there and highlight the diversity of reasons people are there and sometimes even highlight from one founder to another co-founder why they are doing this. They might have never talked about this. Actually, surprisingly, often founders have not talked about why they're doing this. And just knowing why someone is here really helps with conflict resolution for example, really helps with understanding why someone is there on a certain day or something like that. So it's not something we screen for as much as I think we try to help founders discover this among themself and really know this about themself. I've just accepted that the motivations to start companies is widely diverse.

Lenny (00:14:13):
Do you ever discourage founders from starting a company when you see that maybe it won't be a durable kind of lasting motivation or whatever other reasons just knowing how hard starting a company ends up being?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:14:23):
It's a good question. I would say sometimes if someone doesn't have a motivation or don't know why they're doing this, they're doing this because they read that it would be a natural career step. So a good reason to not start a company is if you think of starting a company as a career step. Well, it is not. Because if it's successful, it'll be your entire career. It'll be 10 years most likely. And if it's not successful, then it's not something that people generally aspire to start. So non-successful startups. So I think people will start companies because this is sort of something they want to put on their resume. They have not understood what startups are or why you should do them.

(00:14:58):
Sometimes you can screen and kind of figure this out, but sometimes people don't even know why they're starting a company when they get started and it kind of gets figured out along the way. And that's okay. I don't want to discourage people who don't know exactly why they're starting this company just to start a company. They might figure out along the way and find the true motivation after doing this for a little bit or finding that it's really fun.

(00:15:21):
I think I discourage people to start startups if they have so many other things that are important than their life that are more important than the startup. So if there are financial constraints or family constraints or relationship constraints and they are going to trump this, then yeah, you should think a second time perhaps because startups are hard. They're much harder than a normal job. Equally hard if they're successful or failure, right? There's no middle way, we're like, "Oh, my company is doing great so I can chill." That doesn't work that way either. So I don't really discourage or encourage people, I just want them to have all the information.

Lenny (00:16:03):
You mentioned YC Office Hours and I had a question around this. I'm working on this piece where I'm interviewing a bunch of B2B founders of companies that are doing super well and I asked them a few questions like, "How'd you come up with the idea? How'd you find your first few customers?" it's shocking how many of them bring up a conversation in YC Office Hours as the most pivotal point that set them on the trajectory that they're on now. I'm curious what happens in these Office Hours? What are the most common pieces of advice that you give or maybe most surprising pieces of advice that you give in these Office Hours so that people can get maybe a glimpse into these conversations you have?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:16:43):
So at YC we have two type of Office Hours, two of the common ones. We have regular Office Hours, which is usually a one-on-one or basically the founders talking to me, or me plus another partner. They happen every week or every other week throughout the entire program. And they happen years after the program on the regular basis. Then we have Group Office Hours, which is you and six or seven other startups talking to us. They have [inaudible 00:17:07] a little bit different purpose. So the goal of the regular Office Hour, I always ask the question, "What's holding you back from moving faster? We don't want to hear updates, we don't want to hear strategy questions. We want to understand what's slowing you down or what's holding you back from moving even faster. You generally have a specific goal."

(00:17:27):
And I think that question of what's slowing you down or were holding you back crystallizes the priorities. There are only so many things you can do as a startup and there are only so many things that matters at that stage. And by asking that question, we can start digging into, "Okay, what's the goal? What are the things that drives towards that goal? What are the things that's slowing you down towards that goal?" Usually, the founders don't know what's slowing it down, so the conversation and us probing questions actually leads to us or them discovering what it is just slowing them down.

(00:17:59):
In the Group Office Hour, it's a little bit different. The Group Office Hour holds a couple of different purposes. One of them is if I think back on Paul and Jessica's motivation to start YC, this is a surprise to them, but starting a company is incredibly lonely. You can't really lean on your employees and say, "Hey, I'm feeling really shitty as a founder today. Everything is going to shit." Employees isn't going to take that well. So you lean on perhaps your investors, but they're not really available. But what you can lean on is other founders because they're all in the same situation. It's sort of like when you ask a founder the question, "How are things going?", it's so emotional for them to answer that question because it's never going well, right? It's never like, "Oh, everything is going fantastic." They might say that, but everybody knows all founders, when they look each other's eyes, then no, that's not the answer.

(00:18:48):
So founders have infinite number of problems that they're thinking about all the time, which is why they're allergic to the question, "How are things going?" But when YC started, we put all the founders in a group together in a room and they started learning that all founders, all companies are broken in some way, right? They're all having these massive problems and they're all feeling that anxiety when they hear the question, "How are things going?" And just hearing other founders explain their problems, perhaps solving their problems, is a really good way for yourself to both feel motivated to do it yourself and see how problems get solved when other companies are having similar problems. Nowadays because of the scale at YC, we group companies together that have the same problems or the same area that they're operating in.

(00:19:30):
The second thing that Group Office Hours do well is accountability, right? We ask you, "What were your goals? What were your goals for the last two weeks? Did you hit them?" And then that gives founders accountability because founders are competitive. They don't want to look bad. They don't want to come back after two weeks and say "Nothing worked," or at least like, "We didn't learn anything." They want to learn something and make progress whether it's positive or negative.

(00:19:54):
Group Office Hours to me is the most magical moment because it really creates this very intense three or four month period. Founders often come back to us afterwards and say, "Hey, we want to do that again. We don't have this really intense, really productive period. We don't have a program exactly. We have other programs, but we don't have anything exactly that mimics that experience." But we do encourage founders to continue with Group Office Hours after YC. Many of them do and many of them, ad hoc, continue to meet for years in this group setting where they ask the same kind of questions to each other, to hold themselves accountable, to learn from each other, and to just have someone else to lean on. I think this was unknown and somehow the world didn't know before that starting company is super lonely and you have all these anxiety. By just talking to other people who have the same problems, it's just one of the best thing you can do.

Lenny (00:20:45):
There's so many things that come up when you talk about this. One is I had a startup at one point and we worked in the coworking space. We joined the coworking space because we're like, "Oh, we'll meet other founders. It'll be social, we won't be alone." But it turns out everyone's just heads down, headphones on, "I don't have time for anything. I just need to work." It's like a microcosm of that experience that even if you're surrounded by founders, no one has time to do anything. They're just working.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:09):
You got to schedule it and force it and put the laptops on the floor and the phones on the floor and you just sit there with pen and paper. That's how you have to do it. We tried to mimic that as much as we could over Zoom. But honestly the best experience of this was in person, in a ring, in mountain view with no computers and everyone just paying attention to everyone. That was the best experience. Yeah, that's what I remember is one of the most meaningful parts of YC. I didn't have it myself when I did YC, but now everyone has it.

Lenny (00:21:36):
The other thing that's made me think about is someone tweeted once, "Don't ever ask a founder how they're doing or how it's going. It just creates all this anxiety because nothing's ever going great."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:44):
Don't do it. Everybody looks at each other's eyes and they know that they're allergic to that question.

Lenny (00:21:50):
That's hilarious. So just to summarize the questions you said you asked, the one is in the individual Office Hours, is what's holding you back. And then in the group setting, what was the question again that you asked?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:01):
What are your goals for next two weeks and what were your goals for the last two weeks and did you hit the goals? And if you didn't hit them, what came in the way of hitting the goals? It's very simple. That can uncover lots of problems that other founders are having exactly in the same way. Just by talking about the things that held you back or the things that allowed you to hit your goals, uncover something material for the other seven companies doing that in the ring.

Lenny (00:22:26):
If you kind of zoomed out a little bit and thought about the startups you've worked with, what would you say are the most common mistakes that early stage startups make broadly?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:36):
There's so many. I mean, this is how I initially learned about startups, by searching for that on Google and landing on Paul Graham's articles because he kept-

Lenny (00:22:45):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:45):
I think I've written many articles about this topic because it is so common. So this topic can go on forever. But if I take the most recent experience I've had in YC, I would say startups fail, one, because they don't talk to customers. And if you don't talk to customers or users, you don't actually know what's important. If you don't know what's important, it doesn't matter what you build, it doesn't matter kind of what ideas you have in your head if you don't actually know what it is that you need to build and you don't validate with customers. That's where a lot of the failure stems from. A lot of early YC for us or early part of the program is us pushing and probing founders to be like, "Tell us about the conversations you've had with the customers. What did you learn? Can you show us the organizations?" Or like all these questions, like, "What are the software they're using? What are they paying for? What problems do they have? How are they describing the intensity of that problem?" So that's what we spent a lot of time early at YC.

(00:23:43):
After that, I would say one of the commons mistakes in... I'm not talking about generally startups here, I'm talking inside YC. The second most common thing I see in YC is people are just afraid to talk to customers. They're just not trying hard enough to get in front of customers. I think this comes from, technical people tend to think that software is just sort of solution to everything. But really what you should need to do is to talk to someone over Zoom or over phone or in person, even better. People are just afraid of doing that and they're afraid of being rejected. These are common, people that want to build good products are just really afraid of people saying no.

(00:24:25):
The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters. It doesn't matter if you have something new and cool, they're just not interested. They are not incentivized to take risks in their job to try something new. They're just incentivized to not take risks and just continue what they're doing. Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're The ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have to reach 10 to find one. And then you convince that one person to get on the phone or a video call with you. And that takes work and it takes a lot of work. I think people don't really think of this. This is common knowledge, basic stuff for salespeople, but founders should never done sales before just get surprised by the percentages and the sort of what it means to do this.

(00:25:12):
If I think of more generally outside of YC, so these are two kind of things I experience within YC, but I think generally outside of YC, I would say the two most common problems the same one is not talking to customers, the other one is not being technical and not knowing what it takes to build successful technology company. It means having technical founders and it means being able to build the first prototype. This is something we screen for when we interview people in YC and we aren't accepting a whole lot of team that don't know how to build or get their first prototype built themselves because we know it is a super common value pattern.

(00:25:50):
I can go on and on and on and on for this one, but honestly if I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:26:23):
This is really interesting and good advice. It's interesting that... Like, "Talk to customers," people hear that all the time. They're like, "Of course we're going to talk to customers. We're going to do that of course." And your experience is they know this but they just don't do it probably because they're afraid. Maybe also because they think they already know what they need to build and it's like, "Yeah, we're good."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:26:41):
And you have all these validators, right? So the people are validating that even if you don't talk to customers, why has he accepted you? This investor invested in you. This investor said you were great, like blah blah blah. All these different validations that you confuse with product market fit, right? We have to remind everyone on the first day in YC, "None of you have product market fit because you probably don't," right? Almost nobody has. Because people confuse this external validation with the thing that matters the most, which is talking to customers and learning what matters. It's just like a thing that just keeps coming back. Some get really good at it. And that is the source of successful startups, is when you really get good at this.

Lenny (00:27:21):
It reminds me coming back to Airbnb, one of the most important moments in Airbnb history was Paul Graham telling the founders of Airbnb, "Where are your customers?" And they're like, "Oh, they're in New York" and he's like, "Why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?" And they talk about that all the time.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:27:35):
Yeah, it's absolutely true. I think he wrote the article Do Things That Don't Scale as a learning.... The learning there was the Airbnb founders doing the trips to New York and learning about how to build Airbnb, which is a very counterintuitive idea, which is when you have to spend the most amount of time with your customers. I think Airbnb is sort of one of the best stories inside YC of doing this well.

Lenny (00:27:57):
This also reminds me, I've been talking to a bunch of founders recently. I asked them, "How many customers have you talked to help figure out this idea?" So just the other day it was 150 financial CROs that they talked to before they actually started raising this round. Another company, actually two Airbnb guys that started, they actually ran ads I think on LinkedIn to find specific people to talk to and that specific role. And they talked to probably at least 100, maybe 200. So there's a strong correlation there.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:26):
Yeah, I think that's the volumes that people don't expect. They think they might have to talk to five, but I think you have to talk to 25 to 50. That means you have to reach out to a lot more to be able to get to people that are potentially early adopters. Those ones you talk to are also the ones that become your customers. So you are already doing most of the sales by just doing this work anyway.

Lenny (00:28:45):
Do you have maybe one tactical tip you could share of just either getting over your fear of talking to customers or just holding yourself accountable to actually doing it?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:55):
Yeah, I tell this story, I actually told this story yesterday. So remember when you sign up first service that's a cool service and you hear about in TechCrunch or something like that and then you realize you already signed up a year ago, right? And then from the founder's perspective, you sign up to something you never used it. So the founders who build those services, their inclination to think is that "Everybody hates me because they sign up and they never use me." They never use the service. The fear of that is that basically the fear of rejection. So if I put my thing out there and most people won't use it and they will tell all their friends how shitty this thing is, you should never even sign up for it, that's the fear people have, but the truth is that people sign up for it and be like, "Oh, I'm busy. I got something else to do." And they actually don't remember or care.

(00:29:43):
So whenever you sign for something that you signed up a year ago, think of yourself that that is the common customer experience, which is that you just sign up for a lot of stuff you don't even remember you. You never have this, "I hate this thing' reaction. You always have this like, "I'm indifferent to this thing. I don't actually care to even complete the sign up flow or try it out," right? I think that's the thing that people need to remember, is that the worst thing that can happen to startup is not that people hate what you're doing, it's that they're completely indifferent to what you're doing. It's not the worst thing, but the most common thing that happens is people just is indifferent. But it doesn't give you a second chance. Let's say, it always gives you a second chance and you really need to internalize that people have busy lives and if people don't actually use what you're building, that's fine. You can reach out to them a year from now or six months from now or two weeks from now and they probably will if you make some improvements.

(00:30:37):
I think people just have this fear that, "If I get a lot of rejection, that means everything is bad." But the rejection should be put in context to the early adopter idea and that most people who don't care are not early adopters, who don't want to dig into new things. And that the more narrow of a solution you have to a specific problem, the fewer people actually want to dig in. But that's where you have to start because you cannot build the whole thing right up front and make everybody loves you. That doesn't really work that way.

(00:31:07):
Even Airbnb was like air mattresses or staying in someone's homes when they're home. That was not the complete solution of Airbnb. But there were early adopters who dug in and be like, "Yep, I like that. I like those two things. I want to have people stay in my living room in my mattress." But that's not what Airbnb is about today, and a lot of those things were unknown at the time. But I think people are just afraid of rejection and you just need to overcome that fear and just learn that there's nothing that's really that bad that can happen when people don't use the service or sign up and don't care. It's not really that bad.

Lenny (00:31:42):
It reminds me of a quote that I always love for Mark Andreessen, that everyone's time is already allocated. They don't have space for your product right now. They already have plans for their day.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:31:42):
Totally.

Lenny (00:31:51):
And it takes a lot to convince someone to pay attention to anything. I guess that just comes back to why it's so important that your product is solving a real pain and not just a nice little toy that is better than what's out there, but not so much better that you're like, "I need this right now." So maybe just along those lines, do you have any thoughts on just the importance of that pain and just how critical that is?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:32:15):
I actually recorded... I'm happy of these videos, but I've recorded two videos on YouTube as part of YC Startup School last fall. You can go watch them on YouTube right now. One of them is how to talk to users and the other one is how you sell or how you use sales. The one about talking to users, I think there's a difference in asking someone, "Do you have a problem with X, Y, Z? Is this podcasting setup working for you?" And people say, "Yeah, it's kind of working." But if you are a podcasting setup experts and you watch people use some other thing that's really shitty, they might also think that it's pretty good. But you have to watch them do it. And the best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them or to watch them solve the thing that they do.

(00:33:06):
You know how a lot of non-technical people don't know how to automate things? So they will do the same thing in Excel like a million times by just tapping because that's the only thing that they know and they're not technical enough to write some kind of script to do it, and you just have to watch those people to just feel the pain. You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, y, z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them. So the best thing I've learned about how to discover the pain is to watch people, have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow about the area where you're doing some discovery. That is the best thing.

(00:33:43):
I'll give you another example. So there's a bunch of waste companies that are doing EV charging for electric cars and they're like, "What are the problems in EV charging?" And I was like, "Just rent an EV and go and charge at all the non Tesla chargers and see what they say, see what you experience." And the truth is that it's just like garbage. A lot of EV charting systems are just so shitty and the apps are terrible. You just have to just use them yourself to know how bad it is.

Lenny (00:34:13):
It's cool how often it just comes back to, "Just go do the thing. Do things that don't scale." Classic YC advice. I want to come back to something you mentioned that I want to pull a thread on as the technical co-founder, being technical early on, just to cover that. So I know YC looks to... Having a technical founder is an important variable in you're deciding to accept a company. Say someone doesn't have a technical co-founder, do you have any advice for what they could do, like what often can work?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:34:41):
Yeah, I think the first thing is to understand the value of technical co-founder. So some people who are in this situation where they have an idea of something they want to build and they don't have anyone to help build them in building it, I had a friend Paul who gave this incredible quote, he said, "I have an idea for a song, I just need a musician to help me make it," right? That's kind of similar to how it is with engineering. If you view output of engineering as like, "I just have an idea for a song, I just need someone to actually make it for me" and then you're not valuing software engineering or mechanical engineering or any engineering skill set deep enough, right?

(00:35:17):
The truth is that the engineering part is the really hard part. The first thing I would say is you need to learn how to value the engineering piece. Let me give you an example of how you don't do that. You applied to YC and you have 90% for yourself and 10% for the engineer. You're basically saying that like, "Oh, the engineering part of this company is only worth 1/10th of me. I'm the non-technical person." So that to me is a signal that you're not really valuing engineering.

(00:35:44):
Okay, so how do you go out about and find someone? Well, the truth is that there are a lot of technical co-founders. The technical people, they also want to find business co-founders. They don't want to do other part. They don't want to do sales and they actually don't really care that much about fundraising. They just want to solve the problem. And that's fine. We built something called co-founder matching where those funders can meet, but if you don't participate in that, you can just start by asking the best technical people that you know. "Are you interested in starting a company with me?" Same thing with rejection. Many of them will just say, "No, I have a great job, I'm really happy." But some of them will have thought about starting a company for a while and was hoping that someone would come and ask them to do that. So you have to remove your fears and go and ask the best people.

(00:36:29):
The reason you want to have a technical co-founder and not a hired engineer or not a hired contracting team is because so many of the decisions you're going to make are technical and so many of the iterations you're going to make relies on engineering. And if you don't understand that, you won't actually make the right decisions anyway. It's not like service. You have an idea for a product, you build a product and you're done. There's infinite number of iterations in that process.

(00:36:54):
And then finally, I would say a lot of people learn how to code themselves, right? So there are a lot of places online that you can learn the skillset that takes to build a prototype. You might not be the best engineers. So there are many successful startup founders who are not the best engineers because they stop coding when they hire three or four engineers, that's fine. But you need to be sufficiently good that you understand the value of engineering and that you understand that the best way to solve most of the problem is with software. There are a lot of founders who just, for whatever reason, study something else that doesn't have to be a conscious or very precise reason that you had when you were 18 or 19 and then you're 25, you're like, "Oh, I wish I know how to code" and then just learn to code and they learn how to code. It's not that more difficult than that.

Lenny (00:37:42):
Have you ever seen a startup work out if they had a contracting firm, like engineering firm build a product? Does that ever work or were you just like, "No, do not ever do this"?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:37:53):
Basically, I can't recall any specific ones where people have a contracting firm but I've recalled founders where let's say you had two non-technical founders, but they valued engineering and they had an ability to build a team of great people that were not co-founders and they gave them equity and they become successful. There are many examples of that I would say, but I don't remember any specific examples where you had a contracting team building the whole thing. I think the reason for that is it takes more than just sort of riding a spec to build a product. You can't actually spec yourself to a great product. You have to just be part of the iterations yourself. That's why I think someone being the engineer, having the idea of what iteration looks like and just doing it is how you do things.

(00:38:38):
I think that the cases where I've seen non-technical founders make this work is that they have really good engineering teams who feel like they're founding team. It might not be co-founders per YC-7 definition of having 10%, but they feel like they're the bonding team.

Lenny (00:38:52):
This reminds me of a story of just the recent podcast interview I did with the CPO of Calendly. She talked about how when Calendly started, they actually had a Ukrainian dev team built the first product. Not only did they help them build the first product, they actually ended up driving all the growth initially because they saw Calendly and started using it within their firm.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:14):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:14):
And then everyone that they knew started using it and spread within Ukraine and they actually continue to work with that firm. They're still the [inaudible 00:39:20] team for Calendly or some part of it.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:22):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:24):
Yeah

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:24):
Wow, that's cool.

Lenny (00:39:24):
There's a success story.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:26):
I mean, I would say it's certainly the case that in some countries people have other jobs while they start the startups, so like the engineers. In Ukraine for example or in Eastern Europe, it's very common that if they start their own startup, they actually have a full-time job as a contractor while they're starting the startup because that's how you pay the bill because often you can't raise money. And that's fine too.

Lenny (00:39:46):
Amazing. That's some hustle.

(00:39:49):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time-consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(00:40:47):
I want to zoom out a little bit and ask another big question and see what answer you have for this. If you just think about the most successful startups in YC or even just the companies you worked with, if you had to pick just one or two attributes of what's most common across successful companies, what would that be?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:41:04):
I would say the most common reason that I've seen founders succeed or companies succeed, it comes down to the founders and characteristics of those individuals. The most important characteristics of those individuals are they're really determined to win and they don't give up when things are hard and they have an internal motivation that's just really infectious to people around them, which is how they end up building really good teams around them. People are actually going to want to go and work for them. I have numerous examples of people like this where the CEO or one of the founders are just really inspirational people.

(00:41:42):
The second thing I would say is they are technical. So that's kind of like they're technical enough. If I would grade companies on a scale of technical to less technical, more technical founders are more likely to succeed, I would say. And then I would say they figure out how to talk to users and move fast early on so they don't wait for permission from their investors or from YC or from someone else to make progress. They're like, every day or every week there's continuous progress. They're not doing this for someone else, they're doing this for the customers. They're not doing this for the investors, that's for sure. The investors are sort of in the way more or less. And they're just naturally focusing on the customers.

(00:42:29):
Finally, what I would say is the skill that's really attributed to great founders is excellent communication skills. So the ability to communicate really complicated ideas clearly, to enjoy the communication part, right? Enjoying communication is often kind of correlated with enjoying doing fundraising, which is an important part of some companies' success. Not all of them, but for some of them. I would say communication or storytelling is part of the same arc, right? And those are part of the same thing that actually motivates people around you. If you can communicate why you're building, what you're building and why it's important to the world, tell a story about that, that can motivate people around you to just want to follow you. I think it's rare that I've seen founders succeed where the founder isn't in some way an inspirational person or someone that is a good communicator. Most of the time, you at least have respect or you somewhere know that they're going to succeed, right? And that is what inspires you to be around them or be on their team.

Lenny (00:43:33):
That is a really cool list. So just to summarize, one, they have the strong will to win, and with that they're inspirational. They kind of pull people along and get people really excited. Two is they're more likely to succeed if they're technical and can build a thing. Three, they figure out how to talk to customers, don't wait, just start doing it. And they're just obsessed with that versus what investors want them to do and they don't want to talk to the investors to make time for the customers. And then excellent communication skills, which comes back to the first. They're able to story tell and get people excited. Is that right?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:44:06):
Yeah, I would say those are the attributes of successful things. To be a super successful company, there's something else that have to happen. Those things are not things you can put on a list because they are the outliers, right? If you look at startups on a typical YC batch, there'd be a couple billion companies. Those are the outliers. They'll almost certainly have all the things that we've talked about. Many other companies in the batch will have that too, but then what makes someone a true outlier is something that is unknown. That's why so many investors said no to Airbnb when they were not trying to raise money because that was an outlier idea. It was an idea that was not logical and did not make sense to most people. Those kind of ideas, the ones that end up succeeding often don't make sense to people. There's some reason that no one has done this before because they're just not natural next step of the world.

Lenny (00:44:57):
That's a great segue to a question I've been meaning to ask, which is, how good are you at predicting in a batch which startups are going to be the monster hits? So maybe like you and then just generally YC, how good are you all at knowing what's going to work out, is going to be the next Airbnb or Dropbox?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:45:14):
I think the truth is that we're not very good at knowing what's going to succeed. Certainly we cannot figure out who's going to be the really successful company in the batch. That's not possible. What we're good at is knowing what failure looks like. What we sometimes like to tell founders at the beginning of the batch is like, "If you fail, please do it in some new exciting way. Not one that we've seen 100 times." Because we have seen people fail for a large number of reasons. The best way for us to sort of not predict, but the best way for us to make more companies succeed is to tell them how they might fail, right? Be very direct and honest with them and say, "You doing these three things, these things are likely going to lead that you won't succeed." And if we do our job well, most people get that feedback and they're on the track for succeeding.

(00:46:06):
Now, which of those companies end up becoming the best? There are so many things that are uncorrelated to being the best, and it's the things that people don't like. I'm in a hot industry, I was writing up on TechCrunch like, this investor started talking to me. You'd be surprised how many of the things I just mentioned are uncorrelated to outlier success, right? That's why it's so hard to actually do this. I think people really want these questions to be answered. People really want to believe that you can pick really great companies at the seed stage, but everything I've learned from the plus 600 companies that I've worked with is that it's just not that easy and it's maybe not even possible and certainly not possible when you talk about finding the outlier companies. I don't think it's that easy. And if it was easy, then we would accept a lot fewer companies. We just accept those ones, but it's just not that easy.

Lenny (00:46:59):
Do you have a sense of which ones are likely to work out better than others? Or is it just like, "We have 150 really unclear, but one of these, hopefully."

# The rise of Cursor: The $300M ARR AI tool that engineers can’t stop using | Michael Truell

## Transcript

Michael Truell (00:00:00):
... our goal with Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a very different way to build software. So a world kind of after code, I think that more and more being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What is the most counter-intuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor?

Michael Truell (00:00:20):
We definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role?

Michael Truell (00:00:29):
Many people you hear hire too fast, I think we actually hired too slow to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
You guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year and a half, which is historic. Was there an inflection point where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:00:43):
The growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential. And exponential to begin with feels fairly slow when the numbers are really low, and it didn't really show off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:00:53):
I think it's been...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today, my guest is Michael Truell. Michael is co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of Cursor, it is the leading AI code editor, and is at the very forefront of changing how engineers and product teams build software. It's also one of the fastest growing products of all time, hitting 100 million ARR just 20 months after launching, and then 300 million ARR just two years since launch.

(00:01:22):
Michael's been working on AI for 10 years. He studied computer science and math at MIT, did AI research at MIT and Google, and is a student of tech and business history. As you'll soon see, Michael thinks deeply about where things are heading, and what the future of building software looks like. We chat about the origin story of Cursor, his prediction of what happens after code, his biggest counter-intuitive lessons from building Cursor, where he sees things going for software engineers, and so much more.

(00:04:26):
Michael, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Michael Truell (00:04:30):
Thank you. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:33):
When we were chatting earlier, you had this really interesting phrase, this idea of what comes after code. Talk about that, just the vision you have of where you think things are going in terms of moving from code to maybe something else.

Michael Truell (00:04:45):
Our goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look. With the technology that we have today, and as it matures, we think you can get to a place where you can invent a new method of building software that's [inaudible 00:05:16] higher level, and more productive, in some cases, more accessible too.

(00:05:21):
And that process will be a gradual moving away from what building software looks like today. I want to contrast it with maybe the vision of what software looks like in the future that I think... A couple of visions that are in a popular consciousness that we at least have some disagreement with. One is, there's a group of people who think that software building in the future is going to look very much like it does today, which mostly means text editing, formal programming languages, like TypeScript, and Go, and C, and Rust. And then there's another group that kind of thinks you're just going to type into a bot, and you're going to ask it to build you something, and then you're going to ask it to change something about what you're building, and it's kind of like this chatbot, Slackbot style where you're talking to your engineering department.

(00:06:10):
And we think that there are problems with both of those visions. I think that on the chatbot style end of things... And we think it's going to look weirder than both. The problem with the chatbot style end of things is that lacks a lot of precision. If you want humans to have complete control over what the software looks like, and how it works, you need to let them gesture at what they want to be changed in a form factor that's more precise than just, "Change this about my app." In a text box, removed from the whole thing. And then the version of the world where nothing changes we think is wrong, because we think the technology is going to get much, much, much better.

(00:06:54):
And so a world after code, I think that it looks like a world where you have a representation of the logic of your software that does look more like English, you have written down... You can imagine in [inaudible 00:07:08] form, you can imagine in kind of an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode. You have written down the logic of the software, and you can edit that at a high level, and you can point at that. And it won't be the impenetrable millions of lines of code, it'll instead be something that's much Terser, and easier to understand, easier to navigate. But that world where the kind of crazy, hard to understand symbols start to evolve towards something that's a little bit more human-readable, and human-editable, is one that we're working towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
This is a profound point. I want to make sure people don't miss what you're saying here, which is that what you're envisioning in the next year essentially is kind of when things start to shift, is, people move away from even seeing code, having to think in code in JavaScript and Python, and there's this abstraction that will appear, essentially pseudocode, describing what the code should be doing more in English sentences.

Michael Truell (00:07:59):
Yep. We think it ends up looking like that, and we're very opinionated that that path goes through existing professional engineers, and it looks like this evolution away from code. And it definitely looks like the human still being in the driver's seat, and the human having both a ton of control over all aspects of the software and not giving that up. And then also the human having the ability to make changes very quickly, having a fast duration loop and not just having something in the background that's super slow and takes weeks, go do all your work for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
This begs the question for people that are currently engineers, or thinking about becoming engineers, or designers, or product manager, what skills do you think will be more and more valuable in this world of what comes after code?

Michael Truell (00:08:50):
I think taste will be increasingly more valuable. And I think often when people think about tastes in the realm of software, they think about visuals, or taste over smooth animations, and coloring things, UI, UX, et cetera on the visual design of things. And the visual side of things is an important part of defining a piece of software, but then, as mentioned before, I think that the other half of defining a piece of software is the logic of it, and how the thing works.

(00:09:22):
And we have amazing tools for specing out the visuals of things, and then when you get into the logic of how a piece of software works, really, the best representation we have of that is code right now. You can kind of gesture at it with Figma, and you can gesture at it with writing down notes, but it's when you have an actual working prototype. And so I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood.

(00:09:59):
I think taste will be increasingly important. I think one aspect of software engineering, and we're very far from this right now, and there are lots of funny memes going around the internet about some of the trials and tribulations people can run into if they trust AI for too many things that comes to engineering, around building apps that have glaring deficiencies, and problems, and functionality issues. But I think we will get to a place where you'll be able to be less careful as a software engineer, which, right now, is an incredibly, incredibly important skill. We'll move a little bit from carefulness, and a little bit more towards taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
This makes me think of vibe coding, is that kind of what you're describing when you talk about not having to think about the details as much, and just kind of going with the flow?

Michael Truell (00:10:49):
I think it's related. I think that vibe coding right now describes exactly this state of creation that is pretty controversial, where you're generating a lot of coding, you aren't really understanding the details. That is a state of creation that then has lots of problems, you don't really... By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
One more question along these lines. You threw out this word taste. When you say taste, what are you thinking?

Michael Truell (00:12:01):
I'm thinking having the right idea for what should be built. It will become more and more about effortless translation of, here's exactly what you want built, here's how you want everything to work, here's how you want it to look. And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
Awesome. Okay. I'm going to come back to these topics, but I want to actually zoom us back out to the beginnings of Cursor. I have never heard the origin story, I don't think many people know how this whole thing started. Basically you guys are building one of the fastest growing products in the history of the world, it's changing the way people build products, it's changing careers, professions, it's changing so much. How did it all begin? Any memorable moments along the journey of the early days?

Michael Truell (00:13:05):
Cursor kind of started as a solution search of a problem, and a little bit where it very much came from reflecting on how AI was going to get better over the course of the next 10 years. There were kind of two defining moments, one was being really excited by using the first beta version of Code Pilot, actually. This was the first time we had used an AI product that was really, really, really useful, and was actually just useful at all, and wasn't just a vaporware kind of demo thing.

(00:13:43):
And in addition to being the first AI product that we'd use that was useful, Code Pilot was also one of the most useful, if not the most useful dev tool we'd ever adopted, and that got us really excited. Another moment that got us really excited was the series of scaling on papers coming out of OpenAI and other places that showed that even if we had no new ideas, AI was going to get better and better just by pulling on simple levers, like scaling up the models, and also scaling up the data that was going into the models.

(00:14:12):
And so at the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this got us excited about how AI products were now possible, this technology was going to mature into the future. And it felt like when we looked around, there were lots of people talking about making models, and it felt like people weren't really picking an area of knowledge work and thinking about what it was going to look like as AI got better and better. And that set us on the path to an idea generation exercise, it was like, "How are these areas of knowledge work going to change in the future as this tech gets more mature? What is the end state of the work going to look like? How are the tools that we use to do that work going to change? How are the models going to need to get better to support changes in the work? And once scaling and pre-training ran out, how are you going to keep pushing for technological capabilities?"

(00:15:07):
And the misstep at the beginning of Cursor is we actually worked on... We sort of did this whole grand exercise, and we decided to work on an area of knowledge work that we thought would be relatively uncompetitive, and sleepy, and boring, and no one would be looking at it, because we thought, "Oh, coding's great, coding's totally going to change with this AI, but people are already doing that." So there was a period of four months to begin with, where we were actually working on a very different idea, which was helping to automate and augment mechanical engineering, and building tools for mechanical engineers.

(00:15:44):
There were problems from the get-go in that. Me and my co-founders, we weren't mechanical engineers. We had friends who were mechanical engineers, but we were very much unfamiliar with the field. So there was a little bit of a blind man and the elephant problem from the get-go. There were problems around, how would you actually take the models that exist to today and make them useful for mechanical engineering? The way we netted out is, you need to actually develop your own models from the get-go. And the way we did that was tricky, and there's not a lot of data on the internet of 3D models of different tools and parts, and the steps that I expect to build up to those 3D models, and then getting them from the sources that have them is also a tricky process too.

(00:16:30):
But eventually what happened was, we came to our senses, we realized we're not super excited about mechanical engineering, it's not the thing we want to dedicate our lives to. And we looked around, and in the area of programming, it felt like despite a decent amount of time ensuing, not much has changed, and it felt like the people that were working on the space maybe had a disconnect with us, and it felt like they weren't being sufficiently ambitious about where everything was going to go in the future, and how all of software creation was going to blow through these models. And that's what set us off on the path to building Cursor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
Okay. So interesting. Okay, so first of all, I love that... This is advice that you often hear of go after a boring industry because no one's going to be there, and there's opportunity. And sometimes it works, but I love that in this journey, it's like, "No, actually, go after the hottest, most popular space, AI coding, app building." And it worked out. And the way you phrased it just now is, you didn't see enough ambition potentially, that you thought there was more to be done. So it feels like that's an interesting lesson. Even if something looks like, "Okay, it's too late, there's GitHub, Code Pilot's out there." Some other products. If you notice that they're just not as ambitious as they could be, or as you are, or you see almost a flaw in their approach, that there's still a big opportunity. Does that resonate?

Michael Truell (00:17:46):
That totally resonates. A part of it is, you need there to be leapfrogs that can happen, you need there to be things that you can do. And I think the exciting thing about AI is, in a bunch of places, and I think this is very much still true of our space, and can talk about how we think about that and how we deal with that, but I think that just the ceiling is really high. And yes, if you look around, probably even if you take the best tool, any of these fields, there should be a lot more that needs to be done over the next few years. Having that space, having that high ceiling, I think is unique amongst areas of software, at least the degree to which it is high with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Let's come back to the IDE questions. So there's a few routes you could have taken, and other companies are doing different routes. So there's building an IDE for engineers to work within and adding AI magic to it, there's another route of just a full AI agentic dev product, and then there's just a model that is very good at coding, and focusing on building the best possible coding model. What made you decide and see that the IDE path was the best route?

Michael Truell (00:18:54):
The folks who were from the get-go working on just a model were working on end-to-end automation programming. I think they were trying to build something very different from us, which is, we care about giving humans control over all of the decisions in the end tool that they're building. And I think those folks were very much thinking of a future where end-to-end, the whole thing is done by AI, and maybe the AI is making all the decisions too. And so, one, there was a personal interest component. Two, I think that always, we've tried to be intense realists about where the technology is today, very, very, very excited about how AI is going to mature over the course of many decades. But I think that sometimes people... There's an instinct to see AI do magical things in one area, and then kind of anthropomorphize these models, and think it's better than a smart person here, and so it must be better than a smart person there.

(00:19:55):
But these things have massive issues, and we... From the very start, our product development process was really about dogfooding, and using the tool intensely every day. And we never wanted to ship anything that wasn't useful to us, and we had the benefit of doing that because we were the end users part of our product. And I think that that instills a realism in you around where the tech is right now, and so that definitely made us think that we need the humans to be in the driver's seat, the AI cannot do everything. We're also interested in giving humans that control too for personal reasons, and so that gets you away from just your model company that also gets you away from just this end-end stuff without the human having control.

(00:20:39):
And then the way you get to an IDE versus maybe a plug-in to an existing coding environment is the belief that programming is going to flow through these models, and the active programming is going to change a lot over the course of the next few years. And that the extensibility that existing coding environments have is so, so, so limited, so if you think that the UIs may change a lot, if you think that the form factor programming is going to change a lot, necessarily need to have control over the entire application.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
I know that you guys today have an IDE, and that's probably the bias you have of this is maybe where the future is heading, but I'm just curious, do you think a big part of the future is also going to be AI engineers that are just sitting in Slack and just doing things for you? Is that something that fits into Cursor one day?

Michael Truell (00:21:20):
I think you'll want the ability to move between all of these things fairly effortlessly, and sometimes I think you will want to have the thing kind of go spin off on its own for a while, and then I think you'll want the ability to pull in the AI's work, and then work with it very, very, very quickly, and then maybe have it go spin off again. And so these kind of background versus foreground form factors, I think you want that all to work well in one place. And I think the background stuff, there's a segment of programming that it's especially useful for, which is type of programming tasks where it's very easy to specify exactly what you want without much description, and exactly what correctness looks like without much description.

(00:22:05):
Bug fixes are a great example of that, but it's definitely not all of programming. So I think that what the IDE is will totally change over time, and our approach to having our own editor was premised on, it's going to have to evolve over time. And I think that that will both include, you can spin off things from different surface areas like Slack, or your issue tracker, or whatever it is, and I think that will also include the pane of glass that you're staring at is going to change a lot. We just mostly think of an IDE as the place where you are building software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I think something people don't talk enough about with talking about agents and all these AI engineers that are going to be doing all this stuff for you, is basically we're all becoming engineering managers, with a lot of reports that are just not that smart, and you have to do a lot of reviewing, and approving, and specifying. I guess thoughts on that, and is there anything you could do to make that easier? Because that sounds really hard. Anyone that has had a large team, being like, "Oh my god, all these junior people just checking in with me doing not high quality work over and over." It's just like, "What a life. It's going to suck."

Michael Truell (00:23:11):
Yeah. Maybe you [inaudible 00:23:12] one-on-ones with [inaudible 00:23:15].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
So many one-on-ones.

Michael Truell (00:23:17):
Yeah. So the customers we've seen have most success with AI I think are still fairly conservative about some of the ways in which they use this stuff. And so I do think today, the most successful customers really lean on things like our next edit prediction, where your coding is normal, and making the next into actions you're going to do. And then they also really lean on scoping down the stuff that you're going to hand off to the bot, and for a fixed percent of your time spent reviewing code, from an agent, or from an AI overall, you could... There's two patterns. One is, you could spend a bunch of time specifying things up front, the AI goes and works, and then you then go and review the AI's work, and then you're done. That's the whole task.

(00:24:07):
Or you can really chop things up. So you can specify a little bit, AI writes something, review, specify a little bit, AI writes something, review. Autocompletes all in the way of that spectrum. And still we see often the most successful people using these tools are chopping things up right now, and keeping things fairly [inaudible 00:24:28].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:27):
That sounds less terrible. I'm glad there's a solution here. I want to go back to you guys building Cursor for the first time. What was the point where you realized this is ready? What was a moment of, "Okay, I think this is time to put it out there, and see what happens"?

Michael Truell (00:24:41):
So when we started building Cursor, we were fairly paranoid about spinning for a while, without releasing to the world. And so to begin with too, we actually... The first version of Cursor was hand-rolled. Now we use VS Code as a base, like many browsers use Chromium as a base, and hit foot off of that. To begin with, we didn't, and built the prototype of Cursor from scratch, and that involved a lot of work. We had to build our own... There were a lot of things that go into a modern code editor, including support for many different languages, and navigation support for moving amongst the language, error tracking support for things. There's things like an integrated command line, the ability to use remote servers, the ability to connect to remote servers to view and run code. And so we kind of just went on this blitz of building things incredibly quickly, building our own editor from scratch, and then also the AI components.

(00:25:45):
It was after maybe five weeks that we were living on the editor full-time, and had thrown away our previous editor, and we're using a new one. And then once it got to a point where we found it a bit useful, then we put it in other people's hands, and had this very short beta period. And then we launched it out to the world within a couple of months from the first line of code, I think it was probably three months. And it was definitely a, "Let's just get this out to people and build in public quickly." The thing that took us by surprise is we thought we would be building for a couple hundred people for a long time. And from the get-go, there was an immediate rush of interest, and a lot of feedback too. That was super helpful, we learned from that. That's actually why we switched to being based off of VS Code instead of just this hand-rolled thing. A lot of that was motivated by the initial user feedback, and then had been iterating in public from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:44):
I like how you understated the traction that you got. I think you guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year, year and a half or something like that, which is historic. What do you think was the key to success of something like this? You just talked about dogfooding being a big part of it. You built it in three months, that's insane. What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:27:12):
The three-month version wasn't very good, and so I think it's been a sustained paranoia about, there are all of these ways in which this thing could get better. The end goal is really to invent a very new form of programming that involves automating a lot of coding, as we know today. And no matter where we are with Cursor, it feels like we're very, very far away from that end goal, there's always a lot to do. A lot of it hasn't been over rotated on that initial push, but instead is the continued evolution of the tool, and just making the tool consistently better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
Was there an inflection point after those three months where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:27:51):
To be honest, it felt fairly slow to begin with, and maybe it comes from some impatience on our part. I think there's the overall speed of the growth which continues to take us by surprise. I think one of the things that has been most surprising too is that the growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential, of just consistent month-over-month growth, accelerated at times by launches on our part and other things. But an exponential to begin with feels fairly slow and the numbers are really low, and so it didn't really feel off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:32):
To me this sounds like build it and they will come actually working. You guys just built an awesome product that you loved yourselves as engineers, you put it out, people just loved it, told everyone about it.

Michael Truell (00:28:42):
It being essentially all just us, the team working on the product, and making the product good in lieu of other things one could spend one's time on. We definitely spent time on tons of other things, for instance, building the team was incredibly important, and doing things like support rotations are very important. But some of the normal things that people would maybe reach for in building the company early on, we really let those fires burn for a long time, especially when it came to things like sales and marketing.

(00:29:15):
And so just working on the product, and building a product that you like first, your team likes, and then also then adjusting it for some set of users, that can kind of sound simple, but then, as you know, it's hard to do that well. And there are a bunch of different directions one could have run in, a bunch of different product directions.

(00:29:35):
I think focus, and strategically picking the right things to build, and prioritizing effectively is tricky. I think another thing that's tricky about this domain is, it's kind of a new form of product building, where it's very interdisciplinary in that we are something in between a normal software company and then a foundation model company, in that we're developing a product for millions of people, and that side of things has to be excellent, but then also one important dimension of product quality is doing more and more on the science, and doing more and more on the model side of things in places where it makes sense. And so that element of things doing that well too has been tricky. The overall thing would note is maybe some of these things sound simple to specify, but doing them well is hard, and they're a lot of different way you can run in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Speaker 3 (00:30:38):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):
So what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, and [inaudible 00:30:46], and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files?

Speaker 3 (00:30:55):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:22):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.

Speaker 3 (00:31:30):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record, in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system, and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:51):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co., that's oneschema.co.

(00:32:05):
What is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor, building AI products?

Michael Truell (00:32:11):
I think one thing that's been counterintuitive for us, [inaudible 00:32:14] added a little bit before, but is, we definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development when we started. As mentioned, when we got into this, there were companies that were immediately from the get-go going and just focusing on training model from scratch. And we had done the calculation for what it to train before, and just knew that that was not [inaudible 00:32:36] going to be able to do. And also felt a bit like focusing one's attention in the wrong area, because there were lots of amazing models out there, and why develop all this work to replicate what other players had done. Especially on the pre-training side of things, taking a neural network that knows nothing, and then teaching it the whole internet.

(00:32:55):
And so we thought we weren't going to be doing that at all, and it seems clear to us from the start that the existing models, there were lots of things that they could be doing for us that they weren't doing, because there wasn't the right tool built for them. In fact though, we do a ton of model development, and internally, it's a big focus for us on the hiring front, and have assembled a fantastic team there.

(00:33:18):
And it's also been a big win on the product quality side of things for us. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way. So that was definitely counterintuitive, and surprising, and it's been a gradual thing, where there was an initial use case for training our own model, where it really didn't make sense to use any of the biggest foundation models. That was incredibly successful, moved to another use case that worked really well, and had been going from there. And one of the helpful things in doing this sort of model development is picking your spots carefully, not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to focus on places, and maybe where the best foundation models are excellent, but instead kind of focusing on their weaknesses, and how you can complement them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:05):
I think this is going to be surprising to a lot of people hearing that you have your own models. When people talk about Cursor and all the folks in the space, they would kind of call them GPT wrappers, they're just sitting on top of ChatGPT or Sonnet. What you're saying is that you have your own models, talk about just the stack behind the scenes.

Michael Truell (00:34:21):
Yeah, of course. So we definitely use the biggest foundation models a bunch of different ways, they're really important components of bringing the Cursor experience to people. The places where we use our own models, so sometimes it's to survey a use case that a foundation model wouldn't be able to serve at all for cost or speed reasons. And so one example of that is the autocomplete side of things. And so this can be a little bit tricky for people who don't code to understand, but code is this weird form of work, where sometimes, really, the next 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes of your work is entirely predictable from looking over your shoulder.

(00:35:02):
And I would contrast this with writing. So writing, lots of people are familiar with Gmail's autocomplete, and the different forms of autocomplete that show up when you're trying to post text messages, or emails, or things like that. They can only be so helpful, because often, it's just really not clear what you're going to be writing just by looking at what you've written before. But in code sometimes, when you edit a part of a code base, you're going to need to change things, and in other parts of code base, and it's entirely clear how you're going to need to change things.

(00:35:30):
So one core part of Cursor is this really suit to autocomplete experience, where you predict the next set of that you're going to be doing across multiple files, across multiple places within a file. And making models good at that use case, one, there's a speed component of, those models need to be really fast, they need to give you a completion within 300 milliseconds. There's also this cost component of, we're running tons, and tons, and tons of molecules, every keystroke, we need to be changing our prediction for what you're going to do next. And then it's also this really specialty use case of, you need models that are really good, not at completing the next token, just a generic tech sequence, but are really good at autocompleting a series of diffs, looking at what's changed within a code base, and then creating the next set of things that are going to change, both deleted and added and all of that, and we found a ton of success in training models specifically for that task.

(00:36:23):
So that's a place where no foundation models are involved, it's kind of our own thing. We don't have a lot of labeling or branding about this in the app, power is a very core part of Cursor. And then another set of places where a user own models are to help things like Sonnet, or Gemini, or GPT, and those sit both on the inputs of those big models, and on the output. On the input side of things, those models are searching throughout a code base, try to figure out the parts of a code base to show to one of these big models. You can kind of think about this as a mini Google search that's specifically built for finding the relevant parts of the code base to show one of these big models.

(00:37:02):
And then on the output side of things, we take the sketches of the changes that these models are suggesting, you make with that code base. And then we have models that then fill in the details of, the high level thinking is done by the smartest models, they spend a few tokens on doing that, and then these smaller specialty incredibly fast models, coupled with some inference tricks, then take those high level changes and turn them actually into full code diffs. And so it's been super helpful for pushing on quality in places where you need a specialty task, and it's been super helpful for pushing on speed, which is such an important dimension of product quality for us too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
This is so interesting. I just had Kevin Weil on the podcast, CPO of OpenAI, and he calls this the ensemble of models, that's the same way-

Michael Truell (00:37:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):
... they work, to use the best feature of each one, and to your point, the cost advantages of using cheaper models. These other models, are they based on Llama and things like that, just open source models that you guys plug into and build on?

Michael Truell (00:38:00):
Yeah. So again, we try to be very pragmatic about the place that we're going to do this work, and we don't want to reinvent the wheel. And so starting from the very best pre-trained models that exist out there, often open source ones, sometimes in collaboration with these big model providers that don't share their weights out into the world, because the thing we care about last is the ability to read line by line, the matrix of weights that then go to give you a certain output. We just care about the ability to train these things, to post-train them. And so by and large, yes, open source models, sometimes working with the closed source providers too to tune things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
This leads to a discussion that a lot of AI founders always think about and investors, which is moats, and defensibility in AI. So it feels like one is custom models, is a moat in the space. How do you just think about long-term defensibility in the space, knowing there's other folks, as you said, launching constantly trying to eat your lunch?

Michael Truell (00:39:03):
I think that there are ways to build in inertia and traditional moats, but I think by and large, we're in a space where it is incumbent on us to continue to try to build the best thing, and everyone in this industry. And I truly just think that the ceiling is so high that no matter what entrenchment you build, you can be leapfrogged. And I think that this resembles markets that are maybe a little bit different from normal software markets, normal enterprise markets of the past. I think one that comes to mind is the market for search engines at the end of 1999, or at the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s. I think another market that comes to mind that resembles this market in many ways, it's actually just the development of the peripheral computer and many computers in the '70s, '80s, '90s.

(00:40:03):
And I think that, yes, in each of those markets, the ceiling was incredibly high, it was possible to swish. You could keep getting value for the incremental hour of a smart person's time, the incremental R&D dollar for a really long time, you wouldn't run out of useful things to build. And then in search in particular, not on the computer case, adding distribution was helpful for making the product better too, in that you could tune the algorithms, you could tune the learning based off of the data and the feedback you're getting from users. And I think that all of those dynamics exist in our market too. And so I think maybe the sad truth for people like us, but then the amazing truth for the world is, I think that there are many leapfrogs that exist, there's more useful things to build. We're a long way away from where we can compete in 5, 10 years, and it's incumbent in our state to keep that going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):
So what I'm hearing, this sounds like a lot more like a consumer sort of moat, where it's just, be the best thing consistently so that people stick with you versus creating lock-in and things like that, where they're just... Like Salesforce, where it's just contracts with the entire company, and you have to use this product.

Michael Truell (00:41:10):
Yeah. I think the important thing to note is, if you're in a space where you run out of useful things to do very quickly, then that's not a great situation to be in. But if you're in a place where big investments, and having more and more great people working on the right path can keep giving you value, then you can get these economies of scale of R&D, and you can deeply work on the technology in the right direction, and get to a place where that is defensible. But yes, it is... I think there's a consumer-like tendency to it, and I really think it's just about building the best thing possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):
Do you think in the future there's one winner in this space, or do you think it's going to be a world of a number of products like this?

Michael Truell (00:41:53):
I think the market is just so very big. You asked about the IDE thing early on, and one thing that I think a trip of some people that were thinking about the space is, they looked at the IDE market of the past 10 years, and they said, "Who's making money off of the editors?" It's this super fragmented space where everyone kind of has their own thing, with their own figuration, and there's one company that actually makes money off making great editors, but that company is only so big. And then the conclusion was, it was going to look like that in the future. And I think that the thing that people missed was that there was only so much you could do building an editor in the 2010s for coders, and the company that made money off of editors was doing things like making it easy to navigate around a code base, and doing some error checking and type checking for things, and having good debugging tools.

(00:42:57):
Which were all very useful, but I think that the set of things you can build for programmers, I think the set of things you can build for knowledge workers in many different areas just goes very far and very deep. The problem in front of all of us is the automation of a lot of busy work and knowledge work, and really changing all the areas of knowledge work in front of us to be much higher level and more productive.

(00:43:19):
So that was a long-winded way to say, I think the market's really, really big that we're in. I think it's much bigger than people have realized than the other building tools for developers in the past. And I think that there will be a bunch of different solutions. I think that there will be one company, to be determined if it's going to be us, but I do think that there will be one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software, and that will be a very, very generationally big business. But I think that there will be kind of niches you can occupy in doing something for a particular segment of the market, or for a very particular part of the software development life cycle. But the general programming shifts from just writing formal programming languages to something way higher level. This is the application you purchase and use to do that. I think that there will be generally one winner there, and it will be a very big business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
Juicy. Along those lines, it's interesting that Microsoft was actually at the center of this first, with an amazing product, amazing distribution, Copilot you said was the thing that got you over the hump of, "Wow, there could be something really big here." And it doesn't feel like they're winning, it feels like they're falling behind. What do you think happened there?

Michael Truell (00:44:34):
I think that there are specific historical reasons why Copilot might not have lived up... So far have lived up to the expectations that some people have for it, and then I think that there are structural reasons. I think the structural reason is... And to be clear, Microsoft, in the Copilot case, obviously a big inspiration for our work, and in general, I think they do lots of awesome things, and we're users of many Microsoft products, but I think that this is a market that's not super friendly to incumbents, in that a market that's friendly to incumbents might be one where there's only so much to do, it kind of gets commoditized fairly quickly, and you can bundle that in with other products, and where the ROI between different products is quite small. And in that case, perhaps it doesn't make sense to buy the innovative solution, it makes sense to just kind of buy the thing that's bundled in with other stuff.

(00:45:31):
Another market that might be particularly helpful for incumbents is one where there's... From the get-go, you have your stuff in one place, and it's really, really excruciatingly hard to switch, and for better or for worse. I think in our case, you can try out different tools, and you can decide which product you think is better. And so that's not super friendly to incumbents, and that's more friendly to whoever you think is going to have the most innovative product. And then the specific historical reasons, as I understand them are the group of people that worked on the first version of Copilot have, by and large, gone on to do other things at other places. I think it's been a little hard to coordinate among all the different departments and parties that might be involved in making something like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):
I want to come back to Cursor. A question I like to ask everyone that's building a tool like this, if you could sit next to every new user that uses Cursor for the first time, just whisper a couple tips in their ear to be more successful, most successful with Cursor, what would be 1 or 2 tips?

Michael Truell (00:46:32):
I think right now, and we'd want to fix this at a product level, a lot of being successful with Cursor is kind of having a taste for what the models can do, both what complexity of a task they can handle, and how much you need to specify things to that model, but having a taste for the quality of the model, and where its gaps exist, and what it can do and what it can't. And right now, we don't do a good job in the product of educating people around that, and maybe giving people some swim lanes, giving people some guidelines.

# Inside ChatGPT: The fastest growing product in history  | Nick Turley (OpenAI)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart. Now, you're the PM of the most consequential product in history.

Nick Turley (00:00:05):
I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab. My first task was I fix the blinds, or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
When someone offers you a rocket ship, don't ask which seat.

Nick Turley (00:00:13):
We set out to build a super assistant. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What was it called before?

Nick Turley (00:00:17):
It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be a successful product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
And then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it."

Nick Turley (00:00:23):
This is a pattern with AI, you won't know what to polish until after you ship. My dream is that we ship daily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
By the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5.

Nick Turley (00:00:31):
About 10% of the world population uses every week. With scale comes responsibility. It just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human. This model has taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):
Kevin Weil, your CPO, said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?"

Nick Turley (00:00:43):
I just really want to jump to the punchline, "Why can't we do this now?" I always felt like part of my role here is to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Everyone is always wondering, "Is Chat the future of all of this stuff?"

Nick Turley (00:00:52):
Chat was the simplest way to ship at that time. I'm baffled by how much it took off, even more baffled by how many people have copied.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter.

Nick Turley (00:01:02):
That is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive. I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):
Can you give us a peek into where this goes long-term?

Nick Turley (00:01:09):
ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS. We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today, my guest is Nick Turley. Nick is Head of ChatGPT at OpenAI. He joined the company three years ago, when it was still primarily a research lab. He helped come up with the idea of ChatGPT and took it from 0 to over 700 million weekly active users, billions in revenue, and arguably the most successful and impactful consumer software product in human history. Nick is incredible. He's been very much under the radar. This is the first major podcast interview that he has ever done, and you are in for a treat. We talk about all the things, including the just launched GPT-5.

(00:01:50):

(00:03:22):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:31):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:34):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:41):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names, like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain, start and scale their security programs, and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:20):
That is very much our experience, but before the company, and some extent, during it, but the idea is, with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:36):
We appreciate you for doing that, and you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's vanta.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:50):
Thank you!

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Nick, thank you so much for joining me, and welcome to the podcast.

Nick Turley (00:04:59):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):
I already had a billion questions I wanted to ask you, and then you guys decided to launch GPT-5 the week that we're recording this. So, now, I have at least 2 billion questions for you. I hope you have a lot of time. First of all, just congrats on the launch. It's coming tomorrow, the day after recording this. Just congrats. How are you feeling? I imagine this is an ungodly amount of work and stress. How are you doing?

Nick Turley (00:05:22):
It's a busy week, but we've been working on this for a while, so it also feels really good to get it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):
So, by the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5, the newest ChatGPT. What's the simplest way to just understand what this is, what it unlocks, what people can do with it? Give us the pitch.

Nick Turley (00:05:39):
I'm so excited about GPT-5. I think for most people, it's going to feel like a real step change. If you're the average ChatGPT user, and we have 700 million of them this week, you've probably been on GPT-4o for a while. You probably don't even think about the model that powers the product. And GPT-5, it just feels categorically different. I'll talk about a lot of the specifics, but at the end of the day, the vibes are good, at least we feel that way. We hope that users feel the same. And increasingly, that is the thing that I think most people notice, right? They don't look at the academic benchmarks. They don't look at evaluations. They try the model and see what it feels like. And just on that dimension alone, I'm so excited. I've been using it for a while, but it is also the smartest, most useful, and fastest frontier model that we've ever launched.

(00:06:33):
On pure SMARTs, one way to look at that is academic benchmarks on many of the standard ones, whether or not it's math, or reasoning, or just raw intelligence. This model is state of the art. I'm especially excited about its performance on coding, whether or not that's SWE-bench, which is a common benchmark, or actually front-end coding is really, really good as well, and that's an area where I feel like there's the true step change improvement in GPT-5. But really, no matter how you measure the SMARTs, it's quite remarkable, and I think people are going to feel the upgrade, especially if they weren't using o3 already.

(00:07:13):
And the second thing beyond SMARTs is it's just really useful. Coding is one axis of utility, whether or not you have coding questions or you're vibe coding an app, but it's also a really good writer. I write for a living, internally, externally. I just wrote a big blog post that we published Monday, and this thing is such an incredible editor. And compared to some of the older models, it's got taste, which I think is really exciting. And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model. And it just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human in a way that is hard to articulate until you try it. So, feel good about that.

(00:08:06):
And yeah, as mentioned, it's faster. It thinks, too, just like o3 did, but you don't have to manually tell it to do that. It'll just dynamically decide to think when it needs to. And when it doesn't need to think, it just responds instantly, and that ends up feeling quite a bit faster than using o3 did. And then maybe the thing that's most exciting is that we're making it available for free, and that's one of those things that I feel like we can uniquely do at OpenAI. Because many companies, I think, if they have a subscription model like us, they would gate it behind their paid plan. And for us, if we can scale it, we will, and that just feels awesome. We did that with 4o as well. So, everyone is going to be able to try GPT-5 tomorrow, hopefully.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):
How long does something like this take? I don't know if there's a simple answer to this, but just how long have you guys been working on GPT-5?

Nick Turley (00:08:51):
We've been working on it for a while. You can view GPT-5 as a culmination of a bunch of different efforts. We had a reasoning tech, we had a more classic post-screening methodologies, and therefore, it's really hard to put a beginning on it, but it really is the end point of a bunch of different techniques that we began for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):
Can you give us a peek into the vision for where ChatGPT is going, GPT in general is going? If you look at on the surface, it's been the same idea with a much smarter brain for a long time. I'm curious where this goes long-term.

Nick Turley (00:09:28):
So, to maybe back up a bit, now, you think of ChatGPT as, "Is this going to be ubiquitous product?" Again, about 10% of the world population uses every week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):
Holy shit.

Nick Turley (00:09:39):
I think we have 5 million business customers now. It's an established category in its own right. But really, when we started, we set out to build a super assistant, that's how we talked about it at the time. In fact, the code base that we use is called SA Server. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base, but things always turn out a little bit differently. So, yeah, in some ways, that is still the vision. The reason I don't talk about it more than I do is because I think assistant is a bit limiting in terms of the mental model we're trying to create. You think of this very personified human thing, maybe utilitarian, maybe a... And frankly, having an assistant is not particularly relatable to most people, unless they're in Silicon Valley and they're a manager, or something like that. So it's imperfect.

(00:10:24):
But really, what we envision is this entity that can help you with any task, whether or not that's at home, or at work, or at school, really any context, and it's an entity that knows what you're trying to achieve. So, unlike ChatGPT today, you don't have to describe your problem in menu to detail because it already stands your overarching goals and has context on your life, et cetera. So, that's one thing that we're really excited about. The inverse of giving it more inputs on your life is giving it more action space. So, we're really excited to allow it to do, over time, what a smart, empathetic human with a computer could do for you. And I think the limit of the types of problems that you can solve for people, once you give it access to tools like that, is very, very different than what you might be able to do in a chatbot today. So, that's more outputs.

(00:11:19):
And I often think, "Okay, I'm a general intelligence. What happened if I became Lenny's intern, or something?" And I wouldn't be particularly effective despite having both of those attributes that I just mentioned, and it's because I think this idea of building a relationship with this technology is also incredibly important. So, that's maybe the third piece that I'm excited about is building a product that can truly get to know you over time. And you saw us launch some of those things with improved memory earlier this year, and that's just the beginning of what we're hoping to do so that it really feels like this is your AI. So, I don't know if supersystem is still the right exact analogy, but I think people just think of it as their AI. And I think we can put one in everyone's pocket and help them solve real problems, whether or not that's becoming healthy, whether or not that's starting a business, whether or not that's just having a second opinion on anything. There's so many different problems that you can help with people in their daily life, and that's what motivates me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
So an interesting between the lines that I'm reading here is the vision is for it to be an assistant for people not to replace people. It feels like a really important piece of the puzzle. Maybe just talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:12:29):
AI is really scary to people, and I understand there's decades of movies on AI that have a certain mental model baked in. And even if you just look at the technology today, everyone, I think, has this moment where the AI does something that was really deeply personal to them and you're thought, "Hey, AI can never do that." For me, it was weird music theory things where I was like, "Wow, this thing actually understands music better than I do," and that's something I'm passionate about. And so it's naturally scary. And I think the thing that's been really important to us for a long time is to build something that feels like it's helpful to you, but you're in the driver's seat, and that's even more important as the stuff becomes agentic, the feeling of being in control, and that can be small things.

(00:13:15):
We built this way of watching what the AI is doing when it's in agent mode. And it's not that you actually are going to watch it the whole time, but it gives you a mental model and makes you feel in control in the same way that, when you're in a Waymo, you get that screen, for those of you who've tried Waymo. You can see the other cars. It's not like you're going to actually watch, but it gives you the sense that you know how this thing works and what's happening, or we always check with you to confirm things. It's a little bit annoying, but it puts you in the driver's seat, which is important. And for that reason, we always view technology and the technology that we build as something that amplifies what you're capable of, rather than replacing it, and that becomes important as the deck gets more powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:53):
Okay. So you mentioned the beginnings of ChatGPT. I was reading in a different interview. So you joined OpenAI. ChatGPT was just this internal experimental project that was basically a way to test GPT-3.5, and then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it, maybe see if people find this interesting," yada yada, yada. It's the most successful consumer product in history, I think both in growth rate in users and revenue, and just absurd. Can you give us a glimpse into that early period before it became something everyone is obsessed with?

Nick Turley (00:14:24):
Yeah. So we had decided that we wanted to do something consumer-facing, I think, right around the time that GPT-4 finished training, and it was actually mainly for a couple of reasons. We already had a product out there, which was our developer product. That's actually what I came in to help with initially, and that has been amazing for the mission. In fact, it's grown up. And now, it's the OpenAI platform with, I don't know, 4 million developers, I think. But at that time, it was early stage, and we were running into some constraints with it because there was two problems. One, you couldn't iterate very quickly because, every time you would change the model, you'd break everyone's app. So, it was really hard to try things.

(00:15:03):
And then the other thing was that it was really hard to learn because the feedback we would get was the feedback from the end user to the developer to us. So it was very disintermediated, and we were excited to make fast progress towards AGI and it just felt like we needed a more direct relationship with consumers. So we were trying to figure out where to start. And in classic OpenAI fashion, especially back then, we put together a hackathon of enthusiasts of just hacking on GPT-4 to see what awesome stuff we could create and maybe ship to users, and everyone's idea was some flavor of a super assistant. They were more specific ideas, like we had a meeting bot that would call into meetings, and the vision was maybe it would help you run the meeting over time. We had a coding tool, which full circle now, probably ahead of its time. And the challenge was that we tested those things, but every time we tested these more bespoke ideas, people wanted to use it for all this other stuff because it's just a very, very generically powerful technology.

(00:16:04):
So, after a couple of months of prototyping, we took that same crew of volunteers, and it was truly a volunteer group, right? We had someone from the supercomputing team who had built an iOS app before. We had someone on the research team who had written some backend code in their life. They were all part of this initial ChatGPT team, and we decided to ship something open-ended because we just wanted a real use case distribution. And this is a pattern with AI, I think, where you really have to ship to understand what is even possible and what people want, rather than being able to reason about that a priori. So, ChatGPT came together at the end because we just wanted the learnings as soon as we could, and we shipped it right before the holiday thinking we would come back and get the data and then wind it down. And obviously, that part turned out super differently because people really liked the product as is.

(00:16:56):
So I remember going through the motions of like, "Oh, man, dashboard is broken. Oh, wait, people are liking it. I'm sure it's just going viral and stuff is going to die down," to like, "Oh, wow, people are retaining, but I don't understand why." And then eventually, we fell into product development mode, but it was a little bit by accident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):
Wow. I did not know that ChatGPT emerged out of a hackathon project. Definitely the most successful hackathon project.

Nick Turley (00:17:21):
I like to tell this story when we do our hackathons because I really do want people to feel like they can ship their idea, and it's certainly been true in the past, and we'll continue to make it true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):
If you don't want to share these things, but I wonder who that team was.

Nick Turley (00:17:34):
The team is largely still around. Some of the researchers working on GPT-5, actually, were always part of the ChatGPT team. Engineers are still around. Designers are still around. I'm still here, I guess. So, yeah, you've got the team still running things, but obviously, we've grown up tremendously, and we've had to because with scale comes responsibility. And we're going to hit a billion users soon and you have to begin acting in a way that is appropriate to that scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
Okay. So let me spend a little time there. So, I don't know if this is 100% true, but I believe it is that ChatGPT is the fastest growing, most successful consumer product in history. Also, the most impactful on people's lives. It feels like it's just part of the ether of society now. It's just my wife talks to it. Every question I have, I go to it, voice mode. My wife is just like, "Let me check with ChatGPT." It's just such a part of our life now, and I think it's still early. So many people don't even know what the hell is going on. Just as someone leading this, do you ever just take a moment to reflect and think about just like, "Holy shit"?

Nick Turley (00:18:45):
I have to. It's quite humbling to get to run a product like that, and I have to pinch myself very frequently, and I also have to sometimes sit back and just think, which is really hard when things are moving so quickly. I love setting a fast pace at the company, but in order to do that with confidence, I need at least one day every week that I'm entirely unplugged and I'm just thinking about what to do and process the week, et cetera.

(00:19:14):
And the other thing is I've never ever worked on a product that is so empirical in its nature where, if you don't stop, and watch, and listen to what people are doing, you're going to miss so much, both on the utility and on the risks, actually. Because normally, by the time you ship a product, you know what it's going to do. You don't know if people are going to like it, that's always empirical, but you know what it can do. And with AI, because I think so much of it is emergent, you actually really need to stop and listen after you launch something and then iterate on the things people are trying to do and on the things that aren't quite working yet. So, for that reason alone, I think it's very important to take a break and just watch what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):
Okay. So you take a day off every week... not off. Okay, that's not the right way to put it. You take a day of thinking time, deep work.

Nick Turley (00:20:12):
I need it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I need to hard unplug on a Saturday, or something like that. Obviously-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
On a Saturday [inaudible 00:20:16].

Nick Turley (00:20:16):
But it's just not possible otherwise. This has been a giant marathon for three years now. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Like a sprint marathon.

Nick Turley (00:20:26):
Sprint marathon, that's right, or interval training, or something. I don't know how to exactly describe the OpenAI launch cadence, but you've got to set yourself up in a way that is sustainable. Even if this wasn't AI and it didn't have the interesting attributes that I just mentioned, I think you would need to do that. But especially with AI, it's important to go watch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
So, along those lines, I talked to a bunch of people that work with you, that work at OpenAI. Joanne specifically said that urgency and pace are a big part of how you operate, that that's just something you find really important, to create urgency within the team constantly, even when you are the fastest growing product in history, growing like crazy. Talk about just your philosophy on the importance of pace and urgency on teams.

Nick Turley (00:21:08):
Well, it's nice of her to say that. Two things, with ChatGPT, when we decided to do it, we had been prototyping for so long and I was just like, "In 10 days, we're going to ship this thing," and we did. So, that was maybe a moment in time thing where I just really wanted to make sure that we go learn something. Ever since then, I spent so much time thinking about why ChatGPT became successful in the first place, and I think there was some element of just doing things where there was many other companies that had technology in the LLM space that just never got shipped. And I just felt like, of all the things we could optimize for, learning as fast as possible is incredibly important. So I just started rallying people around that, and that took different forms.

(00:21:55):
For a while, when we were of that size, I just ran this daily release sync and had everyone who was required to make a decision in it, and we would just talk about what to do and to pivot from yesterday, et cetera. Obviously, at some point, that doesn't scale, but I always felt like part of my role here, obviously, was to think about the direction of the product, but also to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat for our teams. And again, this is important anywhere, but it's especially important when the only way to find out what people like and what's valuable is to bring it into the external world. So, for that reason, I think it's become a superpower of OpenAI, and I'm glad that Joanne thinks that I had some part in that, but it really has taken a village.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I love this phrase, "the resting heart rate of your team". That's such a perfect metaphor of just the pace of being equivalent to your resting heart rate.

Nick Turley (00:22:46):
I actually learned that at Instacart, when I showed up there, because we were in the pandemic and it was all hands on deck. For a while, there was this... I think there was a company-wide stand-up because we disbanded all teams. We were just trying to keep the site up. And for me, I had been used to taking my sweet time and just thinking really hard about things, and that's important, but I really learned to hustle over there, and I think that's come in handy at OpenAI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:12):
Okay. So, along these same lines, I asked Kevin Weil, your CPO, what to ask you, and he said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?" Talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:23:22):
That's funny, we have a Slack emoji, apparently, for this now because I used to say that. Now, I try to paraphrase. Sometimes, I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, "Okay, why can't we do this now?" or, "Why can't we do it tomorrow?" And I think that it's a good way to cut through a huge number of blockers with the team and just instill... especially if you come from a larger company. At some point, we started hiring people from larger tech companies. I think they're used to, "Let's check in on this in a week," or, "Let's circle back next quarter to see if we can go on the plan." And I just, as a-

Nick Turley (00:24:00):
... on the plan and I just kind of as a thought exercise, always like people asking, "Okay, if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do?" That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good forcing function for understanding what's critical path versus what can happen later. And I've just always felt like execution is incredibly important. These ideas, they're everywhere. Everyone's talking about a personal AI, you might've seen news on that and I really think that execution is one of the most important things in the space and this is a tool. So, it's funny that that became a meme. It's like a little pink Slack emoji that people just put on whatever they're trying to force the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):
I was going to ask, what theme [inaudible 00:24:47]. So, it's a little pink, is there something in there like-

Nick Turley (00:24:48):
It's a Comic Sans emoji that says, is this maximally accelerated?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:53):
Okay. And so, the kind of the culture there is when someone is working on something, the push is, is this maximally accelerated? Is there a way we can do this faster? Is there anything we can unblock?

Nick Turley (00:25:02):
Yeah. And we use that sparingly, right? Because it needs to be appropriate to the context. There's some things where you don't want to accelerate as quickly as possible because you kind of want process. And we're very, very deliberate on that where your process is a tool. And one of the areas where we have an immense amount of process is safety. Because A, the stakes are already really high, especially with these models, GPT-5 which is a frontier in so many different ways. But B, if you believe in the exponential, which I do and most people who work on this stuff do, you have to play practice for a time where you really, really need the process for sure, sure, sure. And that's why I think it's been really important to separate out the product development velocity, which has to be super high from, for things like frontier models, there actually needs to be a rigorous process where you red team, you work on the system card, you get external input, and then you put things out with confidence that it's gone through the right safeguards.

(00:26:02):
So, again, it's a nuanced concept, but I found it very, very useful when we needed and for everything product development, you're a dead on arrival, so it's important to get stuff out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
We got to open source those memes so that other teams can build on this approach.

Nick Turley (00:26:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
So, interestingly with ChatGPT, and it's not a surprise, but not only is it the fastest-growing, most successful consumer product ever, retention is also incredibly high. People have shared these stats that one month retention is something like 90%, six month retention is something like 80%. First of all, are these numbers accurate? What can you share there?

Nick Turley (00:26:39):
I'm obviously limited on what exactly I can share, but it is true that our retention numbers are really exciting and that is actually the thing we look at. We don't care at all how much time you spend in the product. In fact, our incentive is just to solve your problem and if you really like the product, you'll subscribe, but there's no incentive to keep you in the product for long. But we are obviously really, really happy if over the long run, three month period, et cetera, you're still using this thing. And for me, this was always the elephant in the room early on. It's like, "Hey, this may be a really cool product, but is this really the type of thing that you come back to?" And it's been incredible to not just see strong retention numbers, but just see an improvement in retention over time even as our cohorts become less of an early adopter and more the average person, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:29):
Yeah. So, that note is something that I don't think people truly understand how rare this is when a product... The cohort of users comes, tries it out and then retention over time goes down and then it comes back up, people come back to it a few months later and use it more. It's called a smiling curve, a smile curve, and that's extremely rare.

Nick Turley (00:27:48):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's some smiling going on that's just on the team and I feel like have technology, some of it is not the product. I think people are actually just getting used to this technology in a really interesting way, where I find, and this is why the product needs to evolve too, that this idea of delegating to an AI, it's not natural to most people. It's not like you're going through life and figuring out what can I delegate? Certain sphere of Silicon Valley does that because they're in a self-optimization mode and they're trying to delegate everything they can. But I think for most people in the world it's actually quite unnatural. And you really have to learn, "Okay, what are my goals actually and what could another intelligence help me with?"

(00:28:26):
And I think that just takes time and people do figure it out once they've had enough time with the product. But then of course there's been tons of things that we've done in the product too, whether or not it's making the core models better, whether or not it's new capabilities like search and personalization and all that kind of stuff, or just standard growth work too, which we're starting to do. That stuff matters too, of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
So, you might be answering this question already, but let me just ask it directly. People may look at this and be like, "Okay, they're building this kind of layer on top of this God-like intelligence. Of course it will grow incredibly fast and retention will be incredible. What do you guys actually doing that sits on top of the model that makes it grow so fast and retain so much?" Is there something that has worked incredibly well that has moved metrics significantly that you can share?

Nick Turley (00:29:18):
One thing we've learned, I'll answer that question in a minute, but one thing we've learned with ChatGPT is that there really is no distinction between the model and the product. The model is the product and therefore you need to iterate on it like a product. And by that I mean obviously you typically start by shipping something very open-ended, at least if you're OpenAI [inaudible 00:29:38] that's kind of a playbook. But then you really have to look at what are people trying to do? Okay, they're trying to write, they're trying to code, they're trying to get advice, they're trying to get recommendations and you need to systematically improve on those use cases. And that is pretty similar to product development work. Obviously the methodology is a bit different, but discovery is the same. You got to talk to people, you got to do data science and you got to try stuff and get feedback.

(00:30:04):
So, that's one chunk of work that we've been very consciously doing is improving the model on the use cases people care about. And there's also such thing as vibes because I'm sure you know and that's one of the things that I'm excited about in GPT-5 is that the vibes are really good. So, that too is, we have a model behavior team and they really focus on what is the personality of this model and how does it speak and talk. So, there's that kind of work. I would say that's maybe a third of the retention improvements that we see or so just roughly. And then I think another third is what I would call product research capabilities. They're research driven for sure. They have a research component, but they're really new product features or capabilities. And search is one example of that where if you remember in the olden days, maybe 20 months ago or something, you would talk to ChatGPT and it'd be like, "As of my knowledge cut off..." Or, "I can't answer that because that happened to recently," or something like that.

(00:31:00):
And that is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive and for good reason. It just allows you to do more with the product personalization, like this idea of advanced memory where it can really get to know you over time is another example of a capability like that. I think that's another good chunk. And then the third stuff is the stuff you would do in any product and those things exist too. Not having to log in was a huge hit because it removed a ton of the friction. I think we had this intuition from the beginning, but we never got to it because we didn't have enough GPU or other constraint to really go do that. So, there's the traditional product work too. So, I often think about it as roughly a third, a third, a third, but really we're still learning and we're planning to evolve the product a ton, which is why I'm sure there's going to be new levers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:52):
You mentioned something that I want to come back to real quick. You said that it was something like 10 days from Hackathon to Sam tweeting about ChatGPT being live?

Nick Turley (00:32:01):
The Hackathon happened much earlier and we were prototyping for a long time, but at some point we basically ran out of patience on trying to build something more bespoke. And again, that was mostly because people always wanted to do all this other stuff whenever we tested it. So, it was 10 days from when we decided we were going to ship to when we shipped. And the research we'd been testing for a long time, it was kind of an evolution of what we'd called instruction following, which was the idea that instead of just completing the sentence, these models could actually follow you instructions. So, if you said summarize this, it would actually do so. And the research had evolved from that into a chat format where we could do it multi-turn. So, that research took way longer than 10 days and that kind of baking in the background, but the productization of this thing was very, very fast and lots of things didn't make it in.

(00:32:50):
I remember we didn't have history, which of course was the first user feedback we got. The model had a bunch of shortcomings and it was so cool to be able to iterate on the model. The thing I just talked about, treating the model as a product was not a thing before ChatGPT because we would ship in more hardware where there'd be a release GPT-3 and then we would start working on GPT-4 and these weird giant big spend R&D projects that would take a really long time and the spec was whatever the spec was and then you'd have to wait another year. And ChatGPT really broke that down because we were able to make iterative improvements to it just like software. And really, my dream is that it would be amazing if we could just ship daily or even hourly like in software land because you could just fix stuff, et cetera. But there's of course all kinds of challenges in how you do that while keeping the personality intact while not regressing other capabilities. So, it's an open field to get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
That's such a good example of is it maximally accelerated? Okay, we're going to ship ChatGPT 10 days.

Nick Turley (00:33:48):
[inaudible 00:33:48]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):
Holy moly. We've been talking about ChatGPT. Clearly it's kind of a chat interface. Everyone's always wondering is chat the future of all of this stuff? Interestingly, Kevin Weil made this really profound point that has always stuck with me when he was on the podcast that chat is actually a genius interface for building on a super intelligence because it's how we interact with humans of all variety of intelligence. It scales from someone at the lower end to a super smart person. And so, it's really valuable as a way to scale this spectrum. Maybe just talk about that and is chat the long-term interface for ChatGPT, I guess it's called ChatGPT.

Nick Turley (00:34:27):
I feel like we should either drop the chat or drop the GPT at some point because it is a mouthful. We're stuck with the name, but no matter what we do, the product will evolve. I think that I agree that there's something profound about natural language. It just really is the most natural form of communicating to humans and therefore it feels important that you should be communicating with your software in natural language. I think that's different from chat though. I think chat was the simplest way to ship at the time. I'm baffled by how much it took off as a concept. Even more baffled by how many people have copied the paradigm rather than trying out a different way of interacting with AI. I'm still hoping that will happen. So, I think natural language is here to stay, but this idea that it has to be a turn-by-turn chat interaction I think is really limiting.

(00:35:24):
And this is one of the reasons I don't love the super system analogy, even though we used to always use it is because if you think that way, then you kind of feel like you're talking to a person and GPT-5 it's amazing at making great front-end applications. So, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't have AIs that can render their own UI in some way. And you obviously want to make that predictable and feel good. But it feels limiting to me to think of the end-all-be-all interface as a chatbot. It actually kind of feels dystopian almost where I don't want to use all my software through the proxy of some interface. I love being in Figma, I love being in Google Docs. Those are all great products to me and they're not chatbots.
