# Why most public speaking advice is wrong—and how to finally overcome anxiety | Tristan de Montebello

## Transcript

Tristan de Montebello (00:00:00):
People tend to get into a public speaking voice. We'll be in a class and they'll be chatting normally and look super normal. And then we'll say, "Okay, now just a timer, I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline," and I click play, and suddenly I say, "The important part about doing this," and they enter into a different version of themselves, a professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversation. So the cue I often give people is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Today my guest is Tristan de Montebello. Tristan is the co-Creator of Ultraspeaking, which is the best public speaking workshop I have ever come across. In 2017, Tristan became the fastest competitor to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. And based on that experience, built a very unique course that helps you quickly build the skills to become better and to become more comfortable speaking in public, and especially speaking on the spot.

(00:01:04):
I'd like to spend time on this topic on this podcast because becoming a better speaker is such an accelerant of your professional life. And in this episode, we delve into a bunch of tactics and also misconceptions about how to become a better speaker, and to make it even more fun and interesting, we go through a few of the exercises that Tristan and his team have developed live on the podcast. He goes through them, I go through them, it was a lot of fun. I'm excited to hear what you think. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you, Tristan de Montebello.

(00:01:45):
Tristan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.

Tristan de Montebello (00:01:49):
Thanks so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:51):
So I took an abridged version of this speaking course that you teach called Ultraspeaking, and it immediately made me feel more comfortable public speaking, which I've never felt doing any other course. Public speaking is something it's just is very scary to me as it is for a lot of people, but it's just something I really dread. Even doing these podcast episodes, every time I get nervous before doing these things, as much as it may not seem that way. So this is not my natural habitat speaking, being in public. It may not seem that way to people, but it's true.

(00:02:22):
And the way you approach this stuff is so unique and worked for me. And because of that, I thought it'd be awesome to just bring you on this podcast and basically try to teach people the stuff that you've learned about how to become a better public speaker. I know we're not going to do your course here, but just, what are some very tactical things people can immediately start to apply? And also, I want to make the super interactive, so we're actually going to do some of the exercises that you use in your class. So that's what we're here for. How does that sound?

Tristan de Montebello (00:02:54):
That sounds exciting. I'm in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:56):
Great.

(00:02:59):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation, A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:03:52):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.

(00:04:18):
Today's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites, where you ask a question and it says something like, " Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product. The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions, providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful.

(00:05:11):
Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI. You can sign up at command.ai/lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/lenny.

(00:05:36):
Okay, so let me first ask just kind of a broad question. What do most people get wrong about public speaking? What are some of, what's maybe the biggest misconception about how to become a better public speaker and how to be good at it?

Tristan de Montebello (00:05:49):
I actually think that the biggest misconception with tackling your speaking is that people grossly underestimate just how transformative it could be to your life. And the reason it's so transformative is because speaking is not a specialized skill, it's a meta skill. That means that the better you get at speaking, the better your life gets.

(00:06:16):
So an example of a meta skill is fitness, for example. If you were to start saying, "Okay, I'm going to transform my fitness," and you start lifting weights and you start going on runs, obviously your muscles are going to get bigger, you're going to get more in shape, and your cardiovascular system is going to improve. But that's actually only a sliver of the impact it's going to have on your life because you're going to start feeling more energy, and you're going to start having these nice hormones, these endorphins flowing through your body and you're going to feel better about yourself. And when you walk in front of the mirror, suddenly you're going to have a boost in confidence. So naturally, everything else in your life is going to start to improve as a result of you focusing on your fitness. And for speaking, it's the same thing.

(00:07:01):
This blew my mind when I went on my own speaking journey, is when I started making breakthroughs in speaking, other things started to feel different. So as you get breakthroughs, how you feel at work feels different. How you feel in your group of friends feels different. How you feel in a group of strangers, especially, how you feel and your family can even be impacted. This seeps into everything else in your life. But the thing is, because there's so much self-consciousness that goes with speaking, we often feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety that come with speaking. So it can be hard to realize that underneath these layers, you actually have this extraordinary superpower, because as humans we're evolved to speak, this is what we are. So you don't need to teach a baby how to speak, it will learn by itself with no formal education. So what that means is, we all have this incredible hardware.

(00:08:12):
The thing is, over the course of our life, because of all these little situations that happen, we start getting bugs in the software and we're not really upgrading our software. The moment you get the bugs and things start working, not working, we start avoiding, and suddenly it's like we're not upgrading our software anymore. So we're stuck on old, buggy software. But the reality is, let's not forget that we have incredible software that were evolved for this. So all we need to do is some debugging and some upgrading of the software and suddenly your entire life can change. So that's really one I want to impart on anybody listening. You have it in, you already have what it takes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
Okay. So kind of building on what you just talked about, some of this insight of, your life can improve and how you kind of always have to unlearn stuff. One of my favorite maybe core insights and tenets of the way you approach teaching people to speak, is you talk about how if you don't enjoy speaking, you're doing it wrong. And that really helped me because you kind of encourage, you kind of remind people, try to have fun as you're doing. Can you just talk about that insight and why that's important and how that helps people become better?

Tristan de Montebello (00:09:26):
Well, I think that's very tied to what you were saying. I see enjoyment as a barometer, if I'm doing things right, I'm probably enjoying myself. If I'm doing things wrong, particularly with speaking, because again, this is something we're naturally evolved to do. So if we're naturally evolved to do it, it's not something that we dislike doing. It has to be something that rewards us. So as soon as things start not feeling enjoyable, it's a sign, hey, I'm probably doing this wrong, guy. There's something here that I'm doing that is making this unenjoyable that's probably not helping me.

(00:10:03):
And I think you mentioned that in those people who can hold an audience who are really good communicators in business, it looks like they feel very comfortable, it looks like they feel like themselves. And if you think about speaking, when you're talking with your kids, or with your partner, or with your best friend, your childhood friend, your parents, ever, we all have environments where we feel completely like ourselves. And when we do, communication is extraordinarily enjoyable. It's just a means to connect with other people, a means to share what we have on our mind and it's very, very empowering and it feels very good.

(00:10:42):
Then I take the same person with the same skill set and the same ability and I bring them in a business setting, and suddenly I don't feel like myself anymore. And because of the pressure, I start trying to speak differently. So people start having, I'm going to try to think really hard of what I need to say and I want to control the words that are going to come out of my mouth before they come out of my mouth so I make sure I don't make a mistake. And you basically loop in this thing that is so counter what communication is, which is just a natural subconscious scale. So using speaking as a barometer of, hey, if this is not feeling good, I'm probably overthinking. I probably need to relax and try to just feel a little bit more like myself.

(00:11:27):
But this also applies to practice, where in your practice, because this is not an overnight thing, you can't just snap your fingers, read a book, and be a better speaker. Well, your practice has to be enjoyable as well because otherwise two weeks in, you're going to quit just like a shitty fitness journey or diet. Right? You have to find joy in it and it has to be structured in a way where it rewards you as well, so that you get more energy and you get more enjoyment while you do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:58):
Awesome, and we're going to show people how you do that. You do these games, they're games that you play that help you actually learn these skills. So before that, and also I want to get into actual tactics that we can just give people to become better public speakers. But right before we get there, are there any other core insights or principles or lessons that are fundamental to the way you found that it works to become a better public speaker, that kind of inform a lot of the stuff we're going to be talking about?

Tristan de Montebello (00:12:25):
The day I understood that speaking was a subconscious flow-oriented process and not a conscious process, completely changed the way I approached it. So instead of thinking tactics and frameworks and adding more to the outside of the things I need to think about, when I realized when I speak best, I'm actually not thinking about speaking. It's the last thing I think about is the speaking part. I'm completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey to my audience or the person in front of me. And the goal is to get into a flow state and stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line. That's what really, really changed my mindset about speaking, because then it changes all of the exercise, the exercises you want to do. It changes how you can think about speaking.

(00:13:24):
And one of the ways that changed how I practiced was, instead of focusing on the symptoms of speaking, I started to try and figure out, well, what are the root causes that create these symptoms, and can I address those? So instead of counting my filler words, if that's something that's annoying to me, I'm going to go back and try to figure out, well, what's the root cause of that? Well, the root cause of having lots of filler words or racing in your speaking, is that you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or even pausing when your mind is racing and you feel pressure. Solve that, and not only do the filler words take care of themselves, but the racing takes care of itself and you suddenly have more mind space.

(00:14:11):
And if you feel super constrained in your speaking, very monotonous, then maybe you feel boxed in and you're struggling to allow yourself to feel to be all of what you are under pressure because there's probably a lack of certainty. A lack of trust in, hey, if I let myself be more intense or if I let some of these emotions pop out, or if I take a time to gather my thoughts, is everything going to unravel, or is that going to work for me? And if you haven't proven that to yourself, then you're just going to go for safety and so you're going to be very monotonous and constrained, and that's creates monotony. But if I can solve that, suddenly I have freedom. So thinking through this and understanding that the goal here is upgrading the software and it's really layering, taking all the bad habits away and putting in new habits that I can just stay in this flow state without getting pulled out, that really changes the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:15):
That is a really interesting insight, and I love that you actually demoed that in the way you answered this question, where you took time to get into that state and not just get, um... It's just like, pause.

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:28):
Pause.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
Yeah, that was a really beautiful example of that. Okay, let's get into a few tactics just to give people something they can-

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:29):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:34):
... actually change about the way they speak this week. What are two or three things that you can recommend people tweak in the way that they do public speaking, in the way they speak in meetings and presentations, whatever?

Tristan de Montebello (00:15:47):
I actually thought about this because once you think about speaking being much more about the root causes, like play the games that are going to change you at the root, don't focus on the symptoms, then you find yourself sharing much less purely tactical advice and frameworks because we're trying to get out of our brain into our subconscious.

(00:16:10):
So when I thought about it, I thought of three things I wanted to share. One makes you sound better or look better, one makes you sound better, and one makes you feel better. So the first makes you look better. Now this is super basic and very crunchy, but it's a bad habit that a lot of people have. That when I am trying to gather my thoughts or think, people tend to look down. And if you're looking down on Zoom, it's three times as bad because it looks like you're looking at your phone or looking at notes if you had any, but even when you're in person, it doesn't look very confident. And so you're suddenly giving off of that vibe of, oh, this person feels a little bit uncertain here, and maybe it's going to look like you stopped speaking and you might get more interrupted.

(00:16:56):
If instead you switch that up and you start thinking up. I think up into the right, but you can think in any direction you want, but as long as you're looking up, you actually look thoughtful by default. So suddenly you're looking thoughtful. That means you look more confident because anybody who'd be willing to pause in their speaking is somebody who's confident. And as a result, you're much less likely to get interrupted. So it's a small tweak but makes a real difference.

(00:17:24):
The only thing is if you're not used to doing this, if this is not your habit, then it's going to feel a little bit awkward the first time you do it and you probably won't think about doing it. So I recommend writing, think up, on a post-it and putting it on your computer so that it's there for you. And then once you've done it a few times, this will become the new normal and by default, you'll look more confident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
I'm going to do this as we talk. I have a poster right here. Think up.,

Tristan de Montebello (00:17:48):
Oh, nice. Think up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):
Okay, great. What else?

Tristan de Montebello (00:17:53):
Look more confident. Now how to sound more confident. This is a really important one, and this concept is called end strong. And it's, we had to bring this up because most people tend to end weak. And why is that? They put freestyle rappers in an fMRI, and what they found out is freestyle rappers have to enter a deep flow state. If you're freestyle rapping, you have a beat, you don't have any lyrics, and you have to get into the beat and invent the lyrics and the melody and everything on the fly. So there's no choice but being completely present. What happens is you can see their brain and it's lit up in a very specific place that shows that they're in flow, and when they get to the very end, the brain just blows up. Before they finish, they start getting pulled out of flow. And this is the same feeling of you're running at school and you see the finish line and just a few yards before you start slowing down. It's just, I don't know, we're built that way.

(00:18:53):
And in speaking, it's the same thing. People tend to give a great answer and then either they kind of taper off at the end, which doesn't leave you with a good impression, or they'll actively say the doubts that are coming up in their mind of maybe they'll be giving a great answer and then suddenly they say, "I don't really know if that makes sense."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
I do that all the time. That's very relatable.

Tristan de Montebello (00:19:13):
Yeah, but what the thing is, what happens when you do that? When you do that, it's like you're forcing this lens on your audience, where now even if they had the best of experiences with your answer, now they're looking at everything you said through the lens of, oh, this person was kind of uncertain. So it's like you had a very smooth flight across the Atlantic and your landing was absolutely horrible. You were bumpy when you were coming up, and then when you hit the landing, you bounced three times and you thought you were going to die. You're not going to remember the smooth flight, you're going to remember the ending. So a simple tactic here is, anticipate that as you get to the end of anything you're saying, you're going to naturally start regaining consciousness and you're going to start being a little bit more self-aware, and some of those uncertainties are going to pop up. Know that it's coming and make sure you land the plane.

(00:20:14):
So what that looks like is, either you just make your ending sound like an ending and then leave it at that, or you can prompt your brain. You can use summary prompts, this is incredibly powerful. It just means you say the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of, yeah, the beginning of a sentence, and your brain's going to fill in the gap. It's going to. You're prompting your brain and your brain will always deliver. So you get to the end, you're like, okay, I got to wrap up now. And so you'll say, "So to wrap up..." And your brain's going to fill in the gap. Or, "In summary, so my point here is, so what I want you to remember," and you just place those words and your brain's naturally going to do the work of closing it for you. But make sure you don't let go of the gas pedal at the very last moment, you need to land that plane.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
Awesome. I could definitely get better at this, great tip.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:04):
Yeah, thanks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:06):
I'm going to try to do that as we talk.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:07):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
And what else we got?

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:09):
I'll be paying attention to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
Okay, pressure.

Tristan de Montebello (00:21:15):
Yeah. The third one is staying in character. And these go hand in hand. And what's really powerful is when you start doing these, there's a beautiful feedback loop that happens that gives you a lot of confidence. So staying in character I said is the one that's going to make you feel more confident.

(00:21:33):
What's staying in character? So it's related to end strong in some sense, in that people tend to self-sabotage a lot. I'm speaking, and obviously as I'm speaking, all of my senses are really, really heightened. So I'm aware of everything, if a word comes out a little bit weird or if it's not the word that I was expecting to hear come out of my mouth, I'm going to be very aware of that because I was expecting something and something different happens. But that happens all the time when speaking. I'm starting to not make as much sense or I feel like I'm rambling, going a little bit too long. All of these create insane noise in the back of my mind, the insecurities. And you have a choice there, because I can tell you right now, nobody can tell. People cannot see what you feel, even though it feels that way when you feel really, really strongly, but people can't see it. You're just looking like a normal speaker, competent and confident. But internally, it feels like everybody can see.

(00:22:34):
So you're feeling all this insecurity and it feels like there's an elephant in the room. And so what most people do is they start leaking and they break character. And they'll say, "Oh, man, I'm not making sense right now," or they'll laugh nervously after saying a word that came out weird, which is kind of saying like, "Oh, I also noticed that this word came out weird and it's okay." Right? Or they'll keep letting all of the insecurities and doubts come out when people didn't see it in the first place. So again, it's like I'm forcing these filters onto my audience and now they can only see me through that light.

(00:23:15):
And so one analogy I love for this is, again, a flying analogy. You're on the plane, everything's smooth, you're having a great time watching your movie, and suddenly you're interrupted by the pilot who picks up the intercom and says, "Oh, ladies and gentlemen, so I just had a red light start blinking here in the cockpit, and I'm not sure what this is. It could be really bad, honestly, but I don't know. So don't worry, please, I'll get back to you soon." First thing that's going to happen if you experience that is you're going to think, I wasn't worrying in the first place. But then you start thinking, wait, something probably is going wrong. And now the smallest noise, the tiny little bit of turbulence, a creak on the right, you're going to start thinking, oh no, we're going to die, every time.

(00:24:03):
So you're going to make any little mistake, any little imperfection, you're going to turn that into something big. That's what happens when you speak. If you start leaking and letting the insecurities come out, people are going to start thinking, this person doesn't really know what they're talking about. It's like a leader who isn't clear in their direction. Suddenly I'm thinking, wait, I think I have to second guess everything here because I'm not sure about this guy or this person.

(00:24:33):
And the good news is, the solution is very, very simple. The solution is that is just, don't share your insecurities. Put your best foot forward and stay in it the whole time. Stay in character from beginning all the way through past the ending, because you go all the way through your speech, then you got to end strong, which is a form of staying in character, and then let it be. And that's so important, just let it be and you're going to notice something incredible. If you're the type of person who would break character a lot, start staying in character, and the cue use for myself is, stay in it. And the worse it gets, the more I'll say, just stay in it. And what happens is, you stay in it.

(00:25:21):
And you expect everybody at the end to say, "Oh my God, you looked so uncomfortable, what was happening?" But people can't see that, that you look confident. So they're just going to give you the reaction that a confident person would get, and you're going to notice, oh wow, I am coming off as confident, and that's going to make you feel more confident. And so it's a very reinforcing cycle. If you start staying in character and ending strong, naturally, you're going to be reinforced by this behavior and you're going to realize, oh, I didn't need to break character. I didn't need to hedge every time I spoke, and that's going to give you much more confident, and you're going to start realizing, people just look confident by default. This is a crazy thing. I want everybody to walk around the world and look at people and think, most of the people I'm looking at are actually nervous right now. You're going to look at them and you're like, I can't tell. Most people speaking up in meetings are feeling a level of nervousness, but you can't tell unless it's through the roof.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):
I love this, and it's something I'm extremely guilty of. And I think the reason I do this and the reason I think a lot of people leak, which I love that term of just I don't leak, that you know, feel something's not going right. The reason I do it is I feel like me being upfront, I know this isn't great-

Tristan de Montebello (00:26:41):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):
... makes it okay, but in reality, that's hurting you because it's like when I watch standup comedy. When the comedian's like, "Oh, sorry, that bombed," if he didn't say that or she didn't say that, I'd just forget about it, and we'd move on to the next thing. And it brings all this attention to, oh, I see, okay, it's not going great. Otherwise, you're just like, all right, whatever, I didn't like that joke. And so, yeah, I guess any thoughts on just that, why people do this?

Tristan de Montebello (00:27:07):
Well, I think that's exactly that. It's because you're convinced that everybody can tell. And so two things will happen. Either they could tell because it was a big thing and everybody could tell, but you shining light on it is literally that. It's like, hey, everybody, you're driving a train, everybody's in the train, you're the driver as the speaker, everybody's going with you. So if there's a crash on the side of the road, you can keep going and they'll not be looking at the crash a second later and they'll be looking at the next landscape, or you can stop the train and tell everybody, "Hey, let's look at this crash here real quick. I'm so sorry about it." When you keep going, people will forget it in a second and they're not going to pay attention to you. And with the peak end rule, what we we're seeing, people remember the end of experiences more than they remember the beginning of experiences. So you're going to be left with that feeling at the end.

(00:27:58):
The other piece is, because most people won't notice it in the first place, they'll be in their own minds. So when you share this, you're popping their bubble. And so I see people speaking all the time where I'm super in tune with the feeling I'm getting when they're speaking. I'm listening to the energy, I'm listening to everything that's happening, so I can try to understand, what state are they in right now? So when I get woken up from that state of somebody saying, "Oh man, can I go again right now? That really sucked." It's even more visible for me.

(00:28:36):
And I'll often have to say, "Hey, man, I was so into what you were saying," and I'll poll the audience, "is anyone surprised?" And everybody every time is like, "No, I thought that you were doing great. I was completely with you." So that's the case most of the time, but because we're convinced that people can tell, we want to break that fourth wall or because something happened and we know people can tell, we want to acknowledge it so it doesn't feel like I'm the only one in the room who can't tell that something went wrong here. But this habit of saying, "No, I'm going to be confident, I'm leading, I'm going to keep us going in a certain direction," is extremely powerful and very self-reinforcing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):
Okay, so let's actually show people what this looks like by actually doing some live games. I know one of your principles for Ultraspeaking is you can't learn to speak by not speaking. You need to practice speaking to get better at speaking, and these games are a way to actually do that in a really fun way. So maybe first of all, just why games? When I did this course, I was just like, huh, because it's a bunch of games. I thought this was a public speaking course. So maybe talk about just why you approach it through games, everything you do is a game in this course.

Tristan de Montebello (00:29:48):
Yeah. Well, the first piece of the puzzle is what you were saying, that you can't get better at speaking without speaking. And it's, intuitively you could think, everybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read 100-

Tristan de Montebello (00:30:00):
Everybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read a hundred cookbooks. You actually have to spend most of your time in the kitchen refining your intuition, testing things, experimenting, learning new recipes, and building your timing and everything that goes with it. But in speaking, we tend to do the opposite, probably because it's a little bit scary and because there aren't that many options out there to practice the speaking itself. There aren't that many environments where you can do it right now. So we're kind of left with nothing, so, "Okay, I'll just go read an article or watch a YouTube short and hope that's going to make a difference."

(00:30:38):
But maybe the bad news is, you have to do it. You have to ask yourself, "Am I going to be serious about taking on speaking and making a difference here?" And if you are, then you're going to have to do the thing. You have to practice speaking. But the good news is, it's only the outside that's scary. As soon as you get started, you're going to get rewarded. And then, the better you get at it, the more enjoyable it becomes.

(00:31:03):
So why games then? Well, games number one, are fun to play. And as I was saying earlier, if your practice is not fun, you're going to stop. So you need intrinsic reward with what you're doing. But what all of the Ultraspeaking games have in common is that it's short, deliberate practice, short reps followed by feedback, followed by another rep. So that was more important than the idea that it was a game at first.

(00:31:35):
When we started coaching with Michael Gendler, my co-founder, it was just him and me in my backyard with somebody in front of us testing things out. And we would say, we would give him a speech title just to get a baseline. "Okay, what's the most incredible invention in the world?" And we'd watch this person go into their mind and start freaking out. And they'd think, " The iPhone," and then, "I don't know the iPhone. That's pretty recent. So maybe it's fire. Is it fire though? Was there a bigger maybe communication? I don't know. Wait. Maybe we've evolved for communication."

(00:32:08):
And the longer they spent thinking, the worse their answer tended to be, and the more their confidence tended to go down as they were speaking. So then we said, "Well, we've got to get this person speaking right away." So we'd say, "I'm going to ask you another question, but just start speaking." And so, I'd ask them another question and they couldn't start speaking right away.

(00:32:27):
So we just tried to compress it more and more and more to turn it into something where then it was like, "I'm just going to say a word and you have to say something about it, so horses." "Horseback riding is fun because you can go places." "Cats." "Cats are crazy because if they were bigger, they would eat you." And I just, almost like word association. Let's get words out.

(00:32:46):
Then we started developing different games for everything. Every root cause we were seeing, every symptom we were seeing, we'd figure out the root cause and we'd create some sort of a way to get the person into it as quickly as possible. And it's just one day, six months in that we realized, "Hey, did we just create a game? This feels like a board game." And then we created, I have this, we created Speak Before You Think, the game for people who think too much, and this is a bunch of cards with all of our games. And then, Covid hit and we turned it into online games.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):
Oh, I didn't know that.

Tristan de Montebello (00:33:23):
Yeah. The magic of games is short reps, immediate feedback, practice feedback, practice feedback. And it's enjoyable, you get rewarded, you get to adjust as you go. And what's changing is your internal feeling as you're going. So you're learning lessons, but you're internalizing. All of the practice is happening through speaking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):
To reinforce what you just shared, I haven't shared this with you, but after I took the course, the mini course, I went to see my family in L.A. We visited for a few days, and I was talking about this course and just how fun it was and interesting and how much I learned from it. And I pulled up the games because I have access to the things online. I was just like, "Hey, you guys want to try this?" and we started playing some of these games that we're about to get into. And it was just, we spent like an hour just doing this and everyone loved it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:15):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:15):
Everyone just felt so much better about their public speaking. Afterwards, my mom was like, "Hey, how do I do that on my own later?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:22):
Wow, that's cool.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:23):
My sister's like, "I want to start doing open mic nights because that was really fun just to talk."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):
Nice.

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:28):
So were you actually coaching them? How were you walking them through the different games?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:34):
We just pulled them up and played them. And then, I shared some of the tips that I learned in the class that we took, just like, "Try it this way" or "Try not to focus on being correct. Just focus on confidence and not leaking that you're not doing great." All these things we're going to talk about. Yeah. So it was a lot of fun. So let's get into some of these games. So we're going to try two or three. Which one do you want to start with?

Tristan de Montebello (00:34:56):
Conductor maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
Sweet. I love Conductor. That one was really insightful to me.

Tristan de Montebello (00:35:00):
Okay, so I've got Conductor. The way this game works is that when I click "start training," I'm going to have a random title that's going to appear. And for those of you who are just listening and not watching this, Lenny will say the title out loud so you can hear. And then, what you won't see or what you'll see if you're watching is in front of me, all I'm going to see are a series of random numbers. It's going to start with five, and five is just my natural rate of speaking like I'm speaking right now. But then, I might see a number from one to 10, and each one of these numbers represents an intensity or a state that I have to tap into. So if I see a seven, I automatically have to raise my voice and get into that kind of an energy. And if I see a 10, you could only imagine what that is. But it's also true for the lower ones. If suddenly I see a three, I have to find a way to calm my energy and match the three and go all the way down to one.

(00:36:00):
And then, there might be a slide that says "breathe," which is just an indication to pause. And when I see that slide "breathe," if I just go silent, that's because I'm in front of the breathe slide and I'm not allowed to speak. And in that moment, my goal is just to relax myself and calm myself and then see what happens where I'm at when that slide moves on to the next one. And now we're going to do this. This is going to be 70 seconds, so it's going to be super quick. Ready?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):
Yeah. So I'll read the title as soon as it pops up.

Tristan de Montebello (00:36:31):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:33):
"When I grow up."

Tristan de Montebello (00:36:36):
When I grow up, I want to have taken on all of my weaknesses or all of the emotional things that are holding me back. Because kind of annoying for me that I'm 40 years old and there's still things that are holding me back that man, I've had these when I was a kid. I was like this when I was 10. And it drives me crazy, because aren't I supposed to be an adult? Aren't I supposed to be mature and have my life together? I have two kids. I have this incredible responsibility. And I have to teach them, I have to show them the way. So I've decided I'm going to hire a coach, and I talked to him just a couple of days ago, so this is perfect timing because I want to unwrap, unravel, and untwine every single one of these emotional blockers so that when I grow up, I'm completely free.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):
That was so fun to watch. I'm seeing the numbers. If you're on YouTube, you can see what's going on there. If you're not, basically there's different numbers that give Tristan the different energies to be at, and that was masterful.

Tristan de Montebello (00:37:56):
I think we saw, what did we see? We saw a six. It went up first, six, seven, then it went down to three. Then we saw, I think a two, a one, then a breathe, and then it went back to a five. How about you give it a go and then we chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):
Let's do it. What do you think?

Tristan de Montebello (00:38:11):
Ladies and gentlemen, let's see this. Here we go. The title is The Greatest Puzzle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):
The greatest puzzle that I think that I've had in my life, and I think just for most people, is trying to figure out what to do with their life. And I just had to spend so much time thinking... Actually, no, let me change. I'm changing direction. I actually have known from very early on what I wanted to do with my life. I've actually found it to be not much of a puzzle. I knew from pretty early that I wanted to be a software engineer. And interestingly, I became a software. And as I think about the puzzle that created around my life, I ended up... So my life actually started to look like a puzzle instead of what I'd always thought I'd be. So I ended up having a bunch of different careers. And I look back at my life and it started with one piece, and each piece led to all these other careers. Nailed it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:39:33):
It's funny. At the end you were like, you didn't even see there was a six that came up and then when you looked up, it had already gone away. That's a good warm-up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:42):
Yeah, yeah. Let's do it.

Tristan de Montebello (00:39:42):
It's funny, because what it looked like to me is that, well, you just didn't let yourself play the game. You wanted to... You were more focused on, "I want to make sure this works well, this looks good, or I don't make a fool of myself" than "Let me just play the game." So switch your mindset from that. Back in the Creator Cohort, you didn't really care, because if you failed, it didn't matter. So you just played the game. And this is the same idea. Just don't try. Just let yourself play the game.

# The Godmother of AI on jobs, robots & why world models are next | Dr. Fei-Fei Li

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of people call you the godmother of AI. The work you did actually was the spark that brought us out of AI winter.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:07):
In the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
There's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress. There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:30):
It's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity, but I think every technology is a double-edged sword. If we're not doing the right thing as a society, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
You had this breakthrough insight of just, okay, we can train machines to think like humans, but it's just missing the data that humans have to learn as a child.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:01:03):
I chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We need to train machines with as much information as possible on images of objects, but objects are very, very difficult to learn. A single object can have infinite possibilities that is shown on an image. In order to train computers with tens and thousands of object concepts, you really need to show it millions of examples.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):
Today, my guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li, who's known as the godmother of AI. Fei-Fei has been responsible for and at the center of many of the biggest breakthroughs that sparked the AI revolution that we're currently living through. She spearheaded the creation of ImageNet, which was basically her realizing that AI needed a ton of clean-labeled data to get smarter, and that data set became the breakthrough that led to the current approach to building and scaling AI models. She was chief AI scientist at Google Cloud, which is where some of the biggest early technology breakthroughs emerged from. She was director at SAIL, Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab, where many of the biggest AI minds came out of. She's also co-creator of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, which is playing a vital role in a direction that AI is taking. She's also been on the board of Twitter. She was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in AI. She's also United Nations advisory board. I could go on.

(00:02:29):
In our conversation, Fei-Fei shares a brief history of how we got to today in the world of AI, including this mind-blowing reminder that 9 to 10 years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death knell for your brand because no one believed that AI was actually going to work. Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out. Fei-Fei is incredible and way too under the radar for the impact that she's had on the world, so I am really excited to have her on and to spread her wisdom with more people.

(00:03:22):
A huge thank you to Ben Horowitz and Condoleezza Rice for suggesting topics for this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. With that, I bring you Dr. Fei-Fei Li after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:03:37):
This episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I can involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.

(00:04:15):
Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code-back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny.

(00:04:40):
Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. Justworks knows that your employees are more than just your employees; they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa, and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally, to pay people on time and in their local currencies, and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with Justworks, it's super easy. Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally, Justworks offer simple software and 24/7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources right so that you can do right by your people. Justworks, for your people.

(00:05:31):
Fei-Fei, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:05:34):
I'm excited to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:36):
I'm even more excited to have you here. It is such a treat to get to chat with you. There's so much that I want to talk about. You've been at the center of this AI explosion that we're seeing right now for so long. We're going to talk about a bunch of the history that I think a lot of people don't even know about how this whole thing started, but let me first read a quote from Wired about you just so people get a sense, and in the intro I'll share all of the other epic things you've done. But I think this is a good way to just set context. "Fei-Fei is one of a tiny group of scientists, a group perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table, who are responsible for AI's recent remarkable advances."

(00:06:10):
A lot of people call you the godmother of AI, and unlike a lot of AI leaders, you're an AI optimist. You don't think AI is going to replace us. You don't think it's going to take all our jobs. You don't think it's going to kill us. So I thought it'd be fun to start there, just what's your perspective on how AI is going to impact humanity over time?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:06:30):
Yeah, okay, so Lenny, let me be very clear. I'm not a utopian, so it's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I'm a humanist. I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. So I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity. If you look at the long course of civilization, I think we are, and fundamentally, we're an innovative species that we... If you look at from written record thousands of years ago to now, humans just kept innovating ourselves and innovating our tools, and with that, we make lives better, we make work better, we build civilization, and I do believe AI is part of that. So that's where the optimism comes from. But I think every technology is a double-edged sword, and if we're not doing the right thing as a species, as a society, as communities, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:47):
There's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress, "There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people." I don't have a question there, but what a great line.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:07:59):
Yeah, I feel pretty deeply. I started working AI two and a half decades ago, and I've been having students for the past two decades and almost every student who graduates, I remind them when they graduate from my lab that your field is called artificial intelligence, but there's nothing artificial about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):
Coming back to the point you just made about how it's kind of up to us about where this all goes, what is it you think we need to get right? How do we set things on a path? I know this is a very difficult question to answer, but just what's your advice? What do you think we should be keeping in mind?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:36):
Yeah, how many hours do we have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
How do we align AI? There we go. Let's solve it.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:41):
So I think people should be responsible individuals no matter what we do. This is what we teach our children, and this is what we need to do as grownups as well. No matter which part of the AI development or AI deployment or AI application you are participating in, and most likely many of us, especially as technologists, we're in multiple points. We should act like responsible individuals and care about this. Actually, care a lot about this. I think everybody today should care about AI because it is going to impact your individual life. It is going to impact your community, it's going to impact the society and the future generation. And caring about it as a responsible person is the first, but also the most important step.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):
Okay, so let me actually take a step back and kind of go to the beginning of AI. Most people started hearing and caring about AI, as what it's called today, just like, I don't know, a few years ago when ChatGPT came out. Maybe it was like three years ago.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:51):
Three years ago, almost one more month, three years ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
Wow, okay. And that was ChatGPT coming out. Is that the milestone you have in mind?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:56):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):
Okay, cool. That's exactly how I saw it. But very few people know there was a long, long history of people working on, it was called machine learning back then and there's other terms, and now it's just everything's AI and there was kind of a long period of just a lot of people working on it. And then there's this what people refer to as the AI winter where people just gave up almost, most people did, and just, okay, this idea isn't going anywhere. And then the work you did actually was essentially the spark that brought us out of AI winter and is directly responsible for the world where now of just AI is all we talk about. As you just said, it's going to impact everything we do. So I thought it'd be really interesting to hear from you just the brief history of what the world was like before ImageNet and just the work you did to create ImageNet, why that was so important, and then just what happened after.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:10:44):
It is, for me, hard to keep in mind that AI is so new for everybody when I lived my entire professional life in AI. There's a part of me that is just, it's so satisfying to see a personal curiosity that I started barely out of teenagehood and now has become a transformative force of our civilization. It generally is a civilizational level technology. So that journey is about 30 years or 20 something, 20 plus years, and it's just very satisfying. So where did it all start? Well, I'm not even the first generation AI researcher. The first generation really date back to the '50s and '60s, and Alan Turing was ahead of his time in the '40s by asking, daring humanity with the question, "Is there thinking machines?" And of course he has a specific way of testing this concept of thinking machine, which is a conversational chatbot, which to his standard we now have a thinking machine.

(00:12:02):
But that was just a more anecdotal inspiration. The field really began in the '50s when computer scientists came together and look at how we can use computer programs and algorithms to build these programs that can do things that have been only capable by human cognition. And that was the beginning. And the founding fathers the Dartmouth workshop in the 1956, we have Professor John McCarthy who later came to Stanford who coined the term artificial intelligence. And between the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, it was the early days of AI exploration and we had logic systems, we had expert systems, we also had early exploration of neural network. And then it came to around the late '80s, the '90s, and the very beginning of the 21st century. That stretch about 20 years is actually the beginning of machine learning, is the marriage between computer programming and statistical learning.

(00:13:23):
And that marriage brought a very, very critical concept into AI, which is that purely rule-based program is not going to account for the vast amount of cognitive capabilities that we imagine computers can do. So we have to use machines to learn the patterns. Once the machines can learn the patterns, it has a hope to do more things. For example, if you give it three cats, the hope is not just for the machines to recognize these three cats. The hope is the machines can recognize the fourth cat, the fifth cat, the sixth cat, and all the other cats. And that's a learning ability that is fundamental to humans and remaining animals. And we, as a field, realized, "We need machine learning." So that was up till the beginning of the 21st century. I entered the field of AI literally in the year of 2000. That's when my PhD began at Caltech.

(00:14:33):
And so I was one of the first generation machine learning researchers and we were already studying this concept of machine learning, especially neural network. I remember that was one of my first courses at Caltech is called neural network, but it was very painful. It was still smack in the middle of the so-called AI winter, meaning the public didn't look at this too much. There wasn't that much funding, but there was also a lot of ideas flowing around. And I think two things happened to myself that brought my own career so close to the birth of modern AI is that I chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We can talk a little more later, but so much of our intelligence is built upon visual, perceptual, spatial understanding, not just language per se. I think they're complementary.

(00:15:37):
So I choose to look at visual intelligence and my PhD and my early professor years, my students and I are very committed to a north star problem, which is solving the problem of object recognition because it's a building block for the perceptual world, right? We go around the world interpreting reasoning and interacting with it more or less at the object level. We don't interact with the world at the molecular level. We don't interact with the world as... We sometimes do, but we rarely, for example, if you want to lift a teapot, you don't say, "Okay, the teapot is made of a hundred pieces of porcelain and let me work on this a hundred pieces." You look at this as one object and interact with it. So object is really important. So I was among the first researchers to identify this as a north star problem, but I think what happened is that as a student of AI and a researcher of AI, I was working on all kinds of mathematical models including neural network, including Bayesian network, including many, many models.

(00:16:53):
And there was one singular pain point is that these models don't have data to be trained on. And as a field, we were so focusing on these models, but it dawned on me that human learning as well as evolution is actually a big data learning process. Humans learn with so much experience constantly. In the evolution, if you look at time, animals evolve with just experiencing the world. So I think my students and I conjectured that a very critically-overlooked ingredient of bringing AI to life is big data. And then we began this ImageNet project in 2006, 2007. We were very ambitious. We want to get the entire internet's image data on objects. Now granted internet was a lot smaller than today, so I felt like that ambition was at least not too crazy. Now, it's totally delusional to think a couple of graduate student and a professor can do this.

(00:18:05):
And that's what we did. We curated very carefully, 15 million images on the internet, created a taxonomy of 22,000 concepts, borrowing other researchers' work like linguists work on WordNet, and it's a particular way of dictionarying words. And we combine that into ImageNet and we open-sourced that to the research community. We held an annual ImageNet challenge to encourage everybody to participate in this. We continue to do our own research, but 2012 was the moment that many people think was the beginning of the deep learning or birth of modern AI because a group of Toronto researchers led by Professor Geoff Hinton, participated in ImageNet Challenge, used ImageNet big data and two GPUs from NVIDIA and created successfully the first neural network algorithm that can...

(00:19:12):
It didn't totally solve, but made a huge progress towards solving the problem of object recognition. And that combination of the trio technology, big data, neural network, and GPU was kind of the golden recipe for modern AI. And then fast-forward, the public moment of AI, which is the ChatGPT moment, if you look at the ingredients of what brought ChatGPT to the world technically still use these three ingredients. Now, it's internet-scale data mostly texts is a much more complex neural network architecture than 2012, but it's still neural network and a lot more GPUs, but it's still GPUs. So these three ingredients are still at the core of modern AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
Incredible. I have never heard that full story before. I love that it was two GPUs was the first. I love that. And now it's, I don't know, hundreds of thousands, right, that are orders of magnitude more powerful.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:30):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):
And those two GPUs where they just bought, they were like gaming GPUs, they just went to the-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:34):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:35):
... GameStar that people use for playing games. As you said, this continues to be in a large way, the way models get smarter. Some of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, I've had them all mostly on the podcast, Mercor and Surge and Scale. They continue to do this for labs, just give them more and more label data of the things they're most excited and interested in.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:53):
Yeah, I remember Alex Wang from Scale very early days. I probably still has his emails when he was starting Scale. He was very kind. He keeps sending me emails about how image that inspired Scale. I was very pleased to see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):
One of my other favorite takeaways from what you just shared is just such an example of high agency and just doing things that's kind of a meme on Twitter. Just you can just do things. You're just like, okay, this is probably necessary to move AI. And it's called machine learning back then, right? Was that the term most people used?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:21:25):
I think it was interchangeably. It's true. I do remember the companies, the tech companies, I am not going to name names, but I was in a conversation in one of the early days, I think is in the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. And I remember I was actually encouraging everybody to use the word AI because to me that is one of the most audacious question humanity has ever asked in our quest for science and technology, and I feel very proud of this term. But yes, at the beginning some people were not sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):
What year was that roughly when AI was a dirty word?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:14):
2016, I think because that was-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:15):
2016, less than 10 years ago.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:18):
That was the changing. Some people start calling it AI, but I think if you look at the Silicon Valley tech companies, if you trace their marketing term, I think 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:40):
That's incredible. Just how the world has changed.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:43):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:43):
Now, you can't not call yourself an AI company.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:46):
I know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
Just nine-ish years later.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:49):
Oh, man. Okay. Is there anything else around the history, that early history that you think people don't know that you think is important before we chat about where you think things are going and the work that you're doing?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:23:01):
I think as all histories, I'm keenly aware that I am recognized for being part of the history, but there are so many heroes and so many researchers. We're talking about generations of researchers. In my own world, there are so many people who have inspired me, which I talked about in my book, but I do feel our culture, especially Silicon Valley, tends to assign achievements to a single person. While I think it has value, but it's just to be remembered. AI is a field of, at this point, 70 years old and we have gone through many generations. Nobody, no one could have gotten here by themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):
Okay, so let me ask you this question. It feels like we're always on this precipice of AGI, this kind of vague term people throw around, AGI is coming, it's going to take over everything. What's your take on how far you think we might be from AGI? Do you think we're going to get there on the current trajectory we're on? Do you think we need more breakthroughs? Do you think the current approach will get us there?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:24:13):
Yeah, this is a very interesting term, Lenny. I don't know if anyone has ever defined AGI. There are many different definitions, including some kind of superpower for machines all the way to machines can become economically viable agent in the society. In other words, making salaries to live. Is that the definition of AGI? As a scientist, I take science very seriously and I enter the field because I was inspired by this audacious question of, can machines think and do things in the way that humans can do? For me, that's always the north star of AI. And from that point of view, I don't know what's the difference between AI and AGI.

(00:25:10):
I think we've done very well in achieving parts of the goal, including conversational AI, but I don't think we have completely conquered all the goals of AI. And I think our founding fathers, Alan Turing, I wonder if Alan Turing is around today and you ask him to contrast AI versus AGI, he might just shrugged and said, "Well, I asked the same question back in 1940s," so I don't want to get onto a rabbit hole of defining AI versus AGI. I feel AGI is more a marketing term than a scientific term as a scientist than technologist. AI is my north star, is my field's north star, and I'm happy people call it whatever name they want to call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
So let me ask you maybe this way, like you described, there's kind of these components that from ImageNet and AlexNet took us to where we're today, GPUs essentially, data, label data, just like the algorithm of the model. There's also just the transformer feels like an important step in that trajectory. Do you feel like those are the same components that'll get us to, I don't know, 10 times smarter model, something that's like life-changing for the entire world? Or do you think we need more breakthroughs? I know we're going to talk about world models, which I think is a component of this, but is there anything else that you think is like, oh, this will plateau, or okay, this will take us just need more data, more compute, more GPUs?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:26:44):
Oh no, I definitely think we need more innovations. I think scaling loss of more data, more GPUs, and bigger current model architecture is there's still a lot to be done there, but I absolutely think we need to innovate more. There's not a single deeply scientific discipline in human history that has arrived at a place that says we're done, we're done innovating and AI is one of the, if not the youngest discipline in human civilization in terms of science and technology, we're still scratching the surface. For example, like I said, we're going to segue into world models. Today, you take a model and run it through a video of a couple of office rooms and ask the model to count the number of chairs. And this is something a toddler could do or maybe an elementary school kid could do, and AI could not do that, right?

(00:27:50):
So there's just so much AI today could not do, then let alone thinking about how did someone like Isaac Newton look at the movements of the celestial bodies and derive an equation or a set of equations that governs the movement of all bodies, that level of creativity, extrapolation, abstraction. We have no way of enabling AI to do that today. And then let's look at emotional intelligence. If you look at a student coming to a teacher's office and have a conversation about motivation, passion, what to learn, what's the problem that's really bothering you. That conversation, as powerful as today's conversational bots are, you don't get that level of emotional cognitive intelligence from today's AI. So there's a lot we can do better, and I do not believe we're done innovating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):
Demis had this really interesting interview recently from DeepMind slash Google where someone asked him just like, "What do you think, how far are we from AGI? What does it look like going through there?" He had a really interesting way of approaching it is if we were to give the most cutting-edge model all the information until the end of the 20th century, see if it could come up with all the breakthroughs Einstein had and so far we're nowhere near that, but they could just-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:22):
No, we're not. In fact, it's even worse. Let's give AI all the data including modern instruments data of celestial bodies, which Newton did not have, and give it to that and just ask AI to create the 17th century set of equations on the laws of bodily movements. Today's AI cannot do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:49):
All right. We're ways away is what I'm hearing.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):
Okay, so let's talk about world models. To me, this is just another really amazing example of you being ahead of where people end up. So you were way ahead on, okay, we just need a lot of clean data for AI and neural networks to learn. You've been talking about this idea of world models for a long time. You started a company to build, essentially there's language models. This is a different thing. This is a world model. We'll talk about what that is. And now, as I was preparing for this Elon's talking about world models, Jensen's talking about world models, I know Google's working on this stuff. You've been at this for a long time and you actually just launched something that's going, we're going to talk about right before this podcast airs. Talk about what is a world model? Why is it so important?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:30:33):
I'm very excited to see that more and more people are talking about world models like Elon, like Jensen. I have been thinking about really how to push AI forward all my life and the large language models that came out of the research world and then OpenAI and all this, for the past few years, were extremely inspiring even for a researcher like me. I remembered when GPT2 came out, and that was in, I think, late 2020. I was co-director, I still am, but I was at that time full-time co-director of Stanford's Human-Centered AI institute, and I remember it was... The public was not aware of the power of the large language model yet, but as researchers, we were seeing it, we're seeing the future, and I had pretty long conversations with my natural language processing colleagues like Percy Liang and Chris Manning. We were talking about how critical this technology is going to be and the Stanford AI Institute, Human-Centered AI Institute, HAI, was the first one to establish a full research center foundation model.

(00:31:59):
We were, Percy Liang, and many researchers led the first academic paper foundation model. So it was just very inspiring for me. Of course, I come from the world of visual intelligence and I was just thinking there's so much we can push forward beyond language because humans, humans use our sense of spatial intelligence, a world understanding to do so many things and they are beyond language. Think about a very chaotic first responder scene, whether it's fire or some traffic accident or some natural disaster. And if you immerse yourself in those scene and think about how people organize themselves to rescue people, to stop further disasters, to put down fires, a lot of that is movements is spontaneous understanding of objects, worlds, human situational awareness. Language is part of that, but a lot of those situations, language cannot get you to put down the fire.

(00:33:21):
So that is, what is that? I was thinking a lot. And in the meantime, I was doing a lot of robotics research and it dawned on me that the linchpin of connecting the additional intelligence, in addition to language embodied AI, which are robotics, connecting visual intelligence, is the sense of spatial intelligence about understanding the world. And that's when I think it was 2024, I gave a TED talk about spatial intelligence at world models. And I start formulating this idea back in 2022 based on my robotics and computer vision research. And then one thing that was really clear to me is that I really want to work with the brightest technologists and move as fast as possible to bring this technology to life. And that's when we founded this company called World Labs. And you can see the word world is in the title of our company because we believe so much in world modeling and spatial intelligence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):
People are so used to just chatbots and that's a large language model. A simple way to understand a world model is you basically describe a scene and it generates an infinitely explorable world. We'll link to the thing you launched, which we'll talk about, but just is that a simple way to understand it?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:34:56):
That's part of it, Lenny. I think a simple way to understand a world model is that this model can allow anyone to create any worlds in their mind's eye by prompting whether it's an image or a sentence. And also be able to interact in this world whether you are browsing and walking or picking objects up or changing things as well as to reason within this world, for example, if the person consuming, if the agent consuming this output of the world model is a robot, it should be able to plan its path and help to tidy the kitchen, for example. So world model is a foundation that you can use to reason, to interact, and to create worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:00):
Great. Yeah. So robots feels like that's potentially the next big focus for AI researchers and just the impact on the world. And what you're saying here is this is a key missing piece of making robots actually work in the real world, understanding how the world works.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:36:17):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I do think there's more than robots. That's exciting. But I agree with everything you just said. I think world modeling and spatial intelligence is a key missing piece of embodied AI. I also think let's not underestimate that humans are embodied agents and humans can be augmented by AI's intelligence. Just like today, humans are language animals, but we're very much augmented by AI helping us to do language tasks including software engineering. I think that we shouldn't underestimate or maybe we tend not to talk about how humans, as an embodied agents, can actually benefit so much from world models and spatial intelligence models as well as robots can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):
So the big unlocks here, robots, which a huge deal if this works out, imagine each of us has robots doing a bunch of stuff for us, they help us with disasters, things like that. Games obviously is a really cool example, just like infinitely playable games that you just invent out of your head. And then creativity feels like just like being fun, having fun, being creative, thinking of magic, wild new worlds, and environments.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:37:39):
And also design, humans design from machines to buildings to homes and also scientific discovery. There is so much. I like to use the example of the discovery of the structure of DNA. If you look at one of the most important piece in DNA's discovery history is the x-ray diffraction photo that was captured by Rosalind Franklin, and it was a flat 2D photo of a structure that it looks like a cross with diffractions. You can google those photos. But with that 2D flat photo, the humans, especially two important humans, James Watson and Francis Crick, in addition to their other information, was able to reason in 3D space and deduce a highly three-dimensional double helix structure of the DNA. And that structure cannot possibly be 2D. You cannot think in 2D and deduce that structure. You have to think in 3D spatial, use the human spatial intelligence. So I think even in scientific discovery, spatial intelligence or AI-assisted spatial intelligence is critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):
This is such an example of, I think it was Chris Dixon that had this line that the next big thing is going to start off feeling like a toy. When ChatGPT just came out, I remember Sam Altman just tweeted it as like, "Here's a cool thing we're playing with, check it out." Now, it's the fastest growing product to all of history, changed the world. And it's oftentimes the things that just look like, okay, this is cool, that it's a fun to play with that end up changing the world most.

(00:40:45):
I reached out to Ben Horowitz, who loves what you're doing, a big fan of yours. They're investors I believe in...

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:40:51):
Yeah, we've known each other for many years, but yes, right now they're investors of World Labs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):
Amazing. Okay, so I asked him what I should ask you about and he suggested ask you why is the bitter lesson alone not likely to work for robots? So first of all, just explain what the bitter lesson was in the history of AI and then just why that won't get us to where we want to be with robots.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:41:17):
Well, first of all, there are many bitter lessons, but the bitter lessons everybody refers to is a paper written by Richard Sutton who won the Turing Award recently, and he does a lot of reinforcement learning. And Richard has said, if you look at the history, especially the algorithmic development of AI, it turns out simpler model with a ton of data always win at the end of the day instead of the more complex model with less data. I mean, that was actually... This paper came years after ImageNet. That to me was not bitter; it was a sweet lesson. That's why I built ImageNet because I believe that big data plays that role. So why can't bitter lesson work in robotics alone? Well, first of all, I think we need to give credit to where we are today. Robotics is very much in the early days of experimentation.

(00:42:25):
The research is not nearly as mature as say language models. So many people are still experimenting with different algorithms and some of those algorithms are driven by big data. So I do think big data will continue to play a role in robotics, but what is hard for robotics, there are a couple of things. One is that it's harder to get data. It's a lot harder to get data. You can say, well, there's web data. This is where the latest robotics research is using web videos. And I think web videos do play a role. But if you think about what made language model worth a very... As someone who does computer vision and spatial intelligence and robotics, I'm very jealous of my colleagues in language because they had this perfect setup where their training data are in words, eventually tokens, and then they produce a model that outputs words.

(00:43:36):
So you have this perfect alignment between what you hope to get, which we call objective function and what your training data looks like. But robotics is different. Even spatial intelligence is different. You hope to get actions out of robots, but your training data lacks actions in 3D worlds, and that's what robots have to do, right? Actions in 3D worlds. So you have to find different ways to fit a, what do they call, a square in a round hole, that what we have is tons of web videos. So then we have to start talking about adding supplementing data such as teleoperation data or synthetic data so that the robots are trained with this hypothesis of bitter lesson, which is large amount of data. I think there's still hope because even what we are doing in world modeling will really unlock a lot of this information for robots.

(00:44:53):
But I think we have to be careful because we're at the early days of this and bitter lesson is still to be tested because we haven't fully figured out the data for. Another part of the bitter lesson of robotics I think we should be so realistic about is again, compared to language models or even spatial models, robots are physical systems. So robots are closer to self-driving cars than a large language model. And that's very important to recognize. That means that in order for robots to work, we not only need brains, we also need the physical body. We also need application scenarios. If you look at the history of self-driving car, my colleague Sebastian Thrun took Stanford's car to win the first DARPA challenge in 2006 or 2005. It's 20 years since that prototype of a self-driving car being able to drive 130 miles in the Nevada desert to today's Waymo and on the street of San Francisco.

(00:46:17):
And we're not even done yet. There's still a lot. So that's a 20-year journey. And self-driving cars are much simpler robots, they're just metal boxes running on 2D surfaces, and the goal is not to touch anything. Robot is 3D things running in 3D world, and the goal is to touch things. So the journey is going to be, there's many aspects, elements, and of course one could say, well, the self-driving car, early algorithm were pre deep learning era. So deep learning is accelerating the brains. And I think that's true. That's why I'm in robotics, that's why I'm in spatial intelligence and I'm excited by it. But in the meantime, the car industry is very mature and productizing also involves the mature use cases, supply chains, the hardware. So I think it's a very interesting time to work in these problems. But it's true, Ben is right. We might still be subject to a number of bitter lessons.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):
Doing this work, do you ever just feel awe for the way the brain works and is able to do all of this for us? Just the complexity just to get a machine to just walk around and not hit things and fall, does just give you more respect for what we've already got?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:47:44):
Totally. We operate on about 20 watts. That's dimmer than any light bulb in the room I'm in right now. And yet we can do so much. So I think actually the more I work in AI, the more I respect humans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:03):
Let's talk about this product you just launched. It's called Marble, a very cute name. Talk about what this is, why this is important. I've been playing with it, it's incredible. We'll link to it for folks to check it out. What is Marble?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:48:14):
Yeah, I'm very excited. So first of all, Marble is one of the first product that World Labs has rolled out. World Labs is a foundation frontier model company. We are founded by four co-founders who have deep technical history. My co-founders, Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall. We all come from the research field of AI, computer graphics, computer vision, and we believe that spatial intelligence and world modeling is as important, if not more, to language models and complementary to language models. So we wanted to seize this opportunity to create deep tech research lab that can connect the dots between frontier models with products. So Marble is an app that's built upon our frontier models. We've spent a year and plus building the world's first generative model that can output genuinely 3D worlds. That's a very, very hard problem.

(00:49:30):
And it was a very hard process and we have a team of incredible, founding team of incredible technologists from incredible teams. And then around just a month or two ago, we saw the first time that we can just prompt with a sentence and the image and multiple images and create worlds that we can just navigate in. If you put it on Google, which we have an option to let you do that, you can even walk around. Even though we've been building this for quite a while, it was still just awe-inspiring and we wanted to get into the hands of people who need it. And then we know that so many creators, designers, people who are thinking about robotic simulation, people who are thinking about different use cases of navigable interactable, immersive worlds game developers will find this useful. So we developed Marble as a first step. It's again, still very early, but it's the world's first model doing this, and it's the world's first product that allows people to just prompt, we call it prompt to worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:00):
Well, I've been playing around with it. It is insane. You could just have a little Shire world where you just infinitely walk around middle earth basically, and there's no one there yet, but it's insane. You just go anywhere. There's dystopian world. I'm just looking at all these examples and my favorite part, actually, I don't know if there's a feature or bug, you can see the dots of the world before it actually renders with all the textures. And I just love like, you get a glimpse into what is going on with this model, basically-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:51:27):
That is so cool to hear because this is where, as a researcher, I am learning because the dots that lead you into the world was an intentional feature visualization, is not part of the model. The model actually just generates the world. But we were trying to find a way to guide people into the world, and a number of engineers worked on different versions, but we converged on the dot, and so many people, you're not the only one, told us how delightful that experience is, and it was really satisfying for us to hear that this intentional visualization feature that's not just the big hardcore model actually has delighted our users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:19):
Wow. So you add that to make it more, like to have humans understand what's going on-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:24):
To have fun, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):
... get more delightful. Wow, that is hilarious. It makes me think about LLMs and the way they, it's not the same thing, but they talk about what they're thinking and what they're doing.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:32):
Yes, it is. It is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):
It also makes me think about just the Matrix. It's exactly the Matrix experience. I don't know if that was your inspiration.

# Brian Chesky’s new playbook

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today. Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

(03:22):
First up, we've got Eeke De Miliano. Eeke was head of product at Retool. She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.

Eeke De Miliano (03:36):
"To what do you attribute your success?" And you can't say "luck". Because I think humble people will always say "luck" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.

Lenny (03:58):
Next up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Geoff Charles (04:06):
I ask, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.

Lenny (04:31):
Next up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.

Shishir Mehrotra (04:56):
It's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14]." This question will actually work well for any role. But say, "You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?" That's the whole question.

(05:23):
Usually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, "Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?" All these different questions come out.

(05:39):
I'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, "Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?"

(05:59):
Interestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, "Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. "Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?"

(06:31):
The second one is, "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?"

(06:37):
And then he took those two questions, and he said, "Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants." You can say, "Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run." Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, "Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it."

(06:59):
On the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.

(07:12):
If it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, "Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?"

(07:32):
But these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.

(07:45):
That question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, "I guess I would ask them what size it is." I'm like, "Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.

(08:16):
But then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, "How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, "What is the question that really drives this answer?"

Lenny (08:45):
This next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.

Yuhki Yamashita (08:53):
"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(09:25):
Or sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, "Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on." The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, "Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.

Lenny (09:57):
Next you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.

Katie Dill (10:12):
"Tell me what work you are most proud of?" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Karri Saarinen (10:36):
I think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.

Camille Hearst (11:04):
I like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.

Lenny (11:29):
Next is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.

Jiaona Zhang (11:35):
I do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?

(11:44):
Ambiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward.

(12:05):
I think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (12:44):
Next up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.

Noah Weiss (12:49):
"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" When I say "unfair" or "secret", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. "What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.

Lenny (13:11):
This next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.

Ben Williams (13:22):
"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.

(13:49):
Also, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking "why" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.

(14:08):
And then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.

Lenny (14:42):
Next up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):
"What would your siblings say about you?" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, "What will your parents say about you?" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.

Lenny (15:00):
What do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):
I look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, "My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together," that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, "Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me," that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.

Lenny (15:30):
Next is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.

Paige Costello (15:36):
I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (16:15):
We are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (16:25):
"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you could do that for, "What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.

(16:53):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.

(17:19):
There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate." When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.

Lenny (17:52):
This next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.

Ayo Omojola (18:01):
"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or, "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?"

Lenny (18:21):
Next up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.

Scott Belsky (18:31):
I like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.

(18:49):
I also like the question, "Do you consider yourself lucky?" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.

Lenny (19:18):
Our penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.

Lauryn Isford (19:26):
"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (19:46):
Our final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.

Paul Adams (20:00):
I have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.

Lenny (20:23):
And it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable. Leave a comment either on the newsletter post, or in the YouTube comments, or even on Twitter. Let me know what you think. If there's a great response, we'll continue to do this. If not, we'll never do this again. All right, thank you. Enjoy.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams.

Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

# How to sell your ideas and rise within your company | Casey Winters, Eventbrite

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00:00):
Every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

Lenny (00:00:41):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Casey Winters. Casey was one of the first ever guests on the podcast, and the first to make a return appearance. He's a legend in the growth and product community, having worked with or advised companies like Pinterest, Reddit, Canva, Airbnb, Tinder, Thumbtack, Grubhub, and many more. He recently led product at Eventbrite for just about three years, and recently returned to full-time advising, and he's exploring new opportunities.

(00:01:17):
In our chat, we cover something he calls the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager and how to avoid that, what he's found works best when interviewing product managers, what impact he expects from GPT-4 on the role of product management, when to trust your instincts versus your team's insights and instincts, what are all the different kinds of network effects, and how do you effectively leverage them? Plus a great story about what Grubhub missed that let DoorDash and Uber eat their lunch. I always learn so much from chatting with Casey, and I am 100% sure you will learn a lot from this episode. With that, I bring you Casey Winters, after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but if there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack, this leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. 

(00:02:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.

Casey, welcome back to the podcast.

Casey Winters (00:03:39):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:41):
You are the first ever return guest to my podcast. How does that feel?

Casey Winters (00:03:46):
I feel honored, perhaps a bit unworthy, but I'll go with it.

Lenny (00:03:52):
Well, you're both worthy and I'm honored as well. Thanks for joining me again. I have a lot of stuff that I want to chat about, but first of all, I'm just curious, what are you up to these days? I know you left Eventbrite as CPO, I know you're doing a few advisorships with startups, but how are you spending your days, and what do you think is next for Casey Winters?

Casey Winters (00:04:10):
I'm still spending some time with Whatnot and Eventbrite as  advisors. I stepped back from the CPO of Eventbrite in October, but still working on some long-term marketplace strategy stuff, some growth strategy stuff. I'm on the board of a company called Beek, which is like Netflix for audio in Latin America, and I'm doing some angel investing in marketplaces in what I call tech debt as a service, which is what are startups that are building out things that were hard for my teams in the past to build or maintain inside previous companies? The other thing I'm working on is revamping the product strategy program for Reforge. I got some things keeping me busy, but definitely not as busy as I was last year.

Lenny (00:04:53):
This is like a rare, free agent Case Winters time. Should people reach out if they're interested in maybe working with you? What's your advice for people listening?

Casey Winters (00:05:00):
Yeah. I always love seeing how I can help companies. Everyone should err on the side of reaching out and seeing if I have time to help, if there's something they think I can help with. I love talking to startups, so yeah, absolutely. I can't promise anything, but yeah, I just love talking to people about this stuff.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Awesome. We'll point people to how to get in touch with you at the end of the episode, and it'll be in the show notes too. Talking about the CPO role, you're at Eventbrite. You're a CPO. It reminds me of a post you wrote about how hard the CPO role is. There's some quotes that I recall in your post about how, one, if you ever ask a CPO, chief product officer how they're doing, no one's ever going to say, "I'm crushing it right now."

Casey Winters (00:05:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:05:41):
Then there's this other quote about how you basically, as a CPO, just try to put some points on the board before you inevitably get fired. Why is that? Why do you find that, and do you still believe that to be true after leaving that role? 

Casey Winters (00:05:53):
Yeah, I would say I still believe those things I said. It was funny. A product leader who will remain nameless emailed me when I hit year three at Eventbrite, and they said, "Congrats. You didn't get fired after two years. What's your secret?" I think it's very hard to keep product-market fit as a CPO within a company for a long time. The needs of the business shift over time, and of course, we all have different strengths and weaknesses in our game. No one's perfect at everything. In general, as an executive, it's just impossible to do everything perfectly, and any little misstep, mistake, or something you just missed can blow up in a major way. 

(00:06:33):
Frequently, CEOs have visions that can change and get misaligned with the product leader. Also, with leadership roles, you don't get put on a PIP. If a CEO loses confidence, it's over immediately. Nothing like that happened at Eventbrite. I started to see that the areas of leverage for a product leader were just less in my wheelhouse over time. I just talked to my boss about it, and we worked out something where I continue to advise on the things that I'm uniquely good at, and find other people who are better at some of these other things that were maybe more important at the time.

(00:07:09):
Yeah, I'd say it's a really hard role, or a really challenging role. It can be a lot of fun. I learned a lot from doing it, but yeah, I still believe, and I think I've still yet to hear someone say they've really crushed it. 

Lenny (00:07:26):
Is there anything that you learned from that experience to have survived in that role for three years? I imagine you have a lot of skills and you were very valuable to the company, but I don't know, for someone in that's role maybe right now, just like, "Here's something that I did that maybe you should do." 

Casey Winters (00:07:40):
The first one I can think of is a big change from being a product leader to a CPO or something equivalent is you're actually a company exec first and a product exec second. I think some mistakes I made early that I corrected successfully is you want to show that you are caring and paying attention to the overall business first before just taking care of your own product designers, product managers, researchers, whoever. That's advice I found myself doling out to other product leaders a lot more now that I've gone through it. You have to not only truly care, but create the perception that you care about sales, about marketing, about legal, et cetera. Because first and foremost, you're expected to lead the business at that level, so I think that's something that I think is really important.

(00:08:35):
I think something else is really trying to diagnose, without as much bias as possible, where are the strengths and weaknesses of your team? Where are the strengths and weaknesses of your product? Lay that out with your peers and say, "Here's where we are. Here's where I think we need to go. Here's the timeline on which I'm going to work to get us there." Because I think product's such a confusing discipline for people who aren't in it, like a sales leader, many CEOs, a marketing leader, that they don't necessarily know what great looks like. 

(00:09:14):
The things they know about great leadership, they don't know if you know those things, so you have to make it really clear, "Yeah, I know our OKRs are not as quantitative as they should be yet. That's because this team isn't ready for X, Y, and Z. This is where we're going to get them to, but it's going to take some time." One of the things we did at Eventbrite that I thought was really helpful is, when you go public, you tend to rotate over your executive team and get public company execs versus startup execs. A few of us were new, and it's just like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive on product. Let's do a deep dive on customer support. Where's it at right now? What do you feel like your job is? What do you feel like are the issues you're facing? Where do you want to take it over the next three to five years? Then, let's talk about it."

(00:09:57):
Just forcing you to write it all down is really helpful, but then it forces you to explain it. It helps the rest of the executive team get better company execs because now they really understand product a lot more deeply, or understand finance a lot more deeply, whatever the function is.  

Lenny (00:10:15):
Speaking of gaps and opportunities for people in the company to level up, you've been highlighting this trend that I thought was really interesting, something you call the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager. Can you talk about what that is and what you've been noticing?

Casey Winters (00:10:33):
Yeah, sure thing. This is something I started noticing while managing PMs and product designers at Eventbrite, and it's now coming up with Whatnot as I help them hire new PMs, is the environment in which a lot of product managers have come up is very distorted from when you and I started doing this kind of work. I think we used to always describe PMs as this gang of misfits. We all started in all different functions. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, and the PM team gained as a whole from that diversity of skills and previous experiences.

(00:11:12):
What I noticed is, when we started doing product reviews at Eventbrite, if there was any sort of uncertainty in a problem or a solution, the product manager, instead of shipping to learn, would talk about all this research they have to do to really learn the problems, really learn the solution. 

(00:11:30):
My feedback would be like, no, user research is a scarce resource. We have to reserve it for the areas that have extreme uncertainty and high leverage for getting to certain, so if you're redesigning the login page for Eventbrite, you don't need to use that resource to learn what to do. Just go see what FANG and the top unicorns did. They probably did a good job, and even if they didn't, all of our customers also use those products, so they're going to be familiar with us copying any approach that they've taken.

(00:12:05):
I think we sort of forgot in the industry that many times, the fastest way to learn is to ship, so that if you actually get them to skip research and just go look at competitors, another thing I was noticing is I'd get a list of options other companies have done, but there would be no analysis of why those companies chose different options and what's most applicable for us. 

(00:12:31):
It got me thinking, okay, every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

(00:13:10):
At one point, I got so fed up, I wrote an internal blog post, and I called it On Best Practices and Breakfast Rituals. I talked about how there were these articles about the morning habits of the most successful people, and if you try to do all those things, it'd take you like six hours every morning. There was this article, I think it was on Business Insider or something, about this futurist at Google. He talked about all the pills and food he eats for breakfast every morning to try to live longer. The reporter estimated that it cost him one million a year to have these habits, so I was like, "Hey, I want to make it clear. At Eventbrite, we don't have that much money. We don't have that much time. There's no framework that allows you to not use your brain at this company and just follow some sort of process for success in this profession."

(00:14:02):
I adopted this thing into a public blog post that's on my blog now, but now that I've had some time outside of Eventbrite, I feel like I at least partially missed the mark on what's really going on. I see this with Whatnot, because one of the things I'm helping them with is interviewing, I see PMs again, which I haven't done in a while. It's fascinating interviewing a PM or managers early in their career because Whatnot is a startup, and you know better than most of us as a former founder of one, startups typically require us to wear lots of hats. You have to write SQL. You have to talk directly to customers. You have to prep marketing and sales. Most importantly, you have to make a lot of decisions under uncertainty, which you wouldn't necessarily expect a PM to do at, say, a Google, but it all boils down to using your brain in different ways.

(00:14:54):
Lisa, who's on our legal team, she called Eventbrite a public startup because the pandemic basically erased her business and we had to build it back from scratch. Now that I'm doing these interviews, and whether they come from a small startup, a unicorn, or a public company, they all sort of look the same because there's been so much funding to all these companies. Every company's been acting like they're Google with Google margins, meaning a lot of engineering support, a lot of design support, a lot of research support, lots of analysts around them.

(00:15:22):
They actually seem pretty ill-prepared for a real startup, or even a public company with some uncertainty around it like Eventbrite, so you start getting these weird responses in the interview process. You ask them to solve a problem and they'd say things like, "I can't even begin to come up with solutions until I see all the data and talk to customers." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that's something you would normally do if you took the job, but you don't have the data. You can't talk to customers. Make a decision now. What would you do? I want to see how creative you are. I want to see how much you're intuiting about the real problem and solution," and they can't really answer. 

(00:15:56):
Then my follow-up, which I don't ask, but what I really want to ask is like, "When's the last time you used your brain versus followed a process someone else designed at your company?" Because I want the former, not the latter.

Lenny (00:16:09):
Wow. Amazing. There's a lot of things I want to dig into here. I was going to ask why you call it zero interest rate phenomenon, but I think what I'm hearing is it's when interest rates are zero, everyone's got a lot of money, things are going great. Everyone looks like they're killing it, successful. Everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, and then when that goes away, it's like, "Oh, shit. Maybe not so." 

Casey Winters (00:16:27):
Then also, I think zero interest rates allowed every startup to operate like it was a public company with billions of dollars. That's going to go away over the next five years, and it sort of takes us back to what product management used to be like, which was you didn't have all these resources around. You didn't have all this time to figure it out because if you don't figure it out now and make it work, you may run out of funding, right?

Lenny (00:16:51):
Yeah. Like a very concrete thing that's changed as a lot of research teams have been laid off because they grew really large and companies found, "Maybe we need don't need the ..." Like, "Of all the things we can cut, it's probably an area we can cut." 

Casey Winters (00:17:02):
Yeah, for sure. 

Lenny (00:17:04):
There's probably PMs listening to this wondering, "Shoot, am I one of these? Am I just following a bunch of frameworks?" What's your advice for someone that may fear that, "Oh, shoot. This is maybe who I am and I don't want to necessarily be this"? What could they maybe do?

Casey Winters (00:17:17):
I always advise going to companies where you can learn quickly and try things. I think it's certainly okay to learn a bunch of frameworks. There's a reason I've invested a ton of time in Reforge because I think it actually really does help people to see how other people build things in a way that they can scale it to their other companies, but you have to understand that the job is not to follow the process. The job is not to learn every framework possible. The job is to figure out how to add value to customers that translates into value to the business. Just reorient your North Star, if you've gotten away from that.

(00:17:53):
When I joined Eventbrite, there was this team that didn't ship anything in a quarter. I went to the designer who I knew, and I know that he likes to get stuff out there and likes to get feedback. I was like, "Dude, you didn't ship anything. How could you have gone the entire quarter, not shipped any of your designs and felt that that was okay? If you didn't feel it was okay, why did you censor yourself? Come to me. Tell me why this team is not letting you ship. There's just no way you can get better as a designer. There's no way you can have the impact on the company. There's no way you can have an impact on our users." Those are some things that come to mind to that question.

Lenny (00:18:36):
If you're a PM on a team that maybe isn't shipping, maybe is overusing research, do you have any advice of just like when it makes sense to invest in research? Say you have the resources, is there a rule of thumb you have of like, "Okay. Let's actually spend the time on this verse not"? 

Casey Winters (00:18:51):
I think about it a little bit, depending on the type of job you have and the types of customers you have. The more scale you have tends to be you have less sophisticated customers because you're generally like a consumer thing where the customers are rational. They're not experts. That's generally where you just try things. You measure the impact they have, and you only really bring in USEARCH, research when the impact seems confusing, but you can run experiments. You can get data really easily, so bias towards getting stuff out there and seeing what users respond to.

Lenny (00:19:30):
In consumer product.

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:31):
Interesting. 

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
If you're super enterprise, it's the opposite. Each customer, first off, is sophisticated and tend to be rational. They're paying you like six figures or more, and you could talk to the customers and sales, who knows the customers really well directly, and they tell you want they want. They tell you what they're willing to pay for. You build it. They pay you. Bing, bang, boom. It's not, obviously, as simple as that, but you're basically doing the research directly with the customer and with the sales team, and translating that into things that are strategic to the business.

(00:20:02):
I would say those are the two extremes probably most people are familiar with, but we now have a lot of companies in the middle, where they have more customers. Those customers are more sophisticated. They're consumers. They're maybe employees at companies, or they're small businesses. That's where you have to be more nuanced. This, of course, is where Eventbrite was on, "Hey, when do I really lean in on research? When do I lean in on data? When do I pay attention to internal feedback?

(00:20:29):
" For Eventbrite, we really tried to focus research on the B2B side of Eventbrite, where the problems seemed big, but not well-defined enough. Or that problem's well-defined, but we just really don't feel like we have the right solution yet. If research is going to be a scarce resource inside the company, which I think it will in most places, you have to figure out where it's a high-leverage area, which means either really big problem, we don't understand it well enough, or we know the problem's big. We understand it well, but we're just not sure if our solution's going to, in any way, hit the mark. 

Lenny (00:21:06):
Makes me think about some of the best researchers I've worked with, and they often tell me like, "We don't need to do research on this. We have enough information. We have other things we should be doing."

Casey Winters (00:21:13):
I love it when they say that. Yes.

Lenny (00:21:15):
Yeah. This would have been a really good segue to another topic I want to talk about, which is around gut instincts versus team expertise, which we're going to get to, but I have a couple more questions along these lines. 

Casey Winters (00:21:24):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:21:25):
You talked about interviewing PMs at Whatnot. Can you actually describe Whatnot? Just because you mentioned it a couple times, just so people know what we're talking about here.

Casey Winters (00:21:33):
Oh, sure. Whatnot's a livestreaming marketplace, mostly focused on the collectibles market. Sellers, whether it's like baseball cards, or women's handbags, or sneakers, they'll go live on video and show you the products they have that they're selling. People that are watching the stream can engage with the sellers and bid on different items, so kind of like Twitch meets eBay would be a good way to describe it. 

Lenny (00:21:54):
Awesome, awesome. I'll just mention, I'm a tiny angel investor in that company. 

Casey Winters (00:21:56):
Oh, that's why you brought it up. Okay, I get it.

Lenny (00:22:00):
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what this word was because it's like a fun word, Whatnot. What I wanted to actually get to is you said you were interviewing a lot of project managers for them.

Casey Winters (00:22:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:09):
What is your approach to interviewing PMs? What do you find is a really good signal for someone that's going to be successful?

Casey Winters (00:22:14):
I feel like the whole thing's gotten so performative. It's like interviewing is handing out Oscars based on who's prepared the best tell me about a time response, versus actually assessing who can do the job we're hiring for. It's like most PMs are better PM interviewers than PMs now. There's this quote from a movie called The Way of the Gun. I don't know if you've ever seen it.

Lenny (00:22:35):
No.

Casey Winters (00:22:36):
Benicio del Toro says in it, it's like, "These days, they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime." I think about that quote a lot when it comes to interviewing. I would say I'm a bit contrarian here in my approach. I don't ask about your work history. I don't care about your perfectly practiced answers. I'm going to give you real scenarios that I expect from the role. I want to hear how you'd approach them. If you can't come up with a few reasonable ideas, figure out how to test them quickly without analyst support or research, I'm just not interested.

(00:23:10):
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. Interviewing is a very lossy format, but the more I can see them do the job we're hiring for with questions, whether it's a presentation, a prompt, that gets me the most comfortable that they know the job they're signing up for, that they've shown in a practice scenario they can do it, and they actually enjoyed it in some way.

Lenny (00:23:29):
Are there red flags you look for in these interviews? One is maybe you said of like, "I can't even begin to answer this without research and data." Is there anything else?

Casey Winters (00:23:36):
Some things I pay attention to is if they're talking about solutions that are going to take a long time to get signal from, whether it's months and months of engineering time before you actually see the impact on users or the business, I think that's always great. If they're not factoring in the amount of time it will take, in general, is not a good sign, and not thinking a bit more holistically about the types of metrics they expect to improve versus track to make sure they haven't gone down. Those are some things that I pay a lot of attention to.

Lenny (00:24:11):
How much do you think they're intimidated by being interviewed by Casey Winters? How much do you think that factors in?

Casey Winters (00:24:16):
I think you overestimate my importance or awareness in the community. I think most people have no idea who I am when they start talking to me.

Lenny (00:24:25):
Mm-hmm. [inaudible 00:24:25] Another thought is there's this meme that GBT-4, or 5, or 6, or 10 is going to replace product managers, and anytime some new feature comes out, people will put out these videos of, "Oh, look. They're doing all the PM's jobs." What's your take on the future of PM in AI, if any?

Casey Winters (00:24:41):
Well, I think if you thought the PM job was just filling in the latest Reforge or Shreyas framework, and then getting that automatic FANG promotion every year and a half, then yeah, you're going to get replaced by AI. I think the real PM job is the least likely to get replaced over time because you need real subject matter expertise. You need to be trading off a lot of different types of things, and making good decisions for the company and for your customers. 

(00:25:10):
In terms of using AI now as a PM, I'd actually be cautious in the current iteration of the cycle for PMs. It's a tool that's trained on sounding smart rather than always necessarily being smart. I was at Eventbrite the other day, and someone was telling me how they were loving the new Notion AI integration. She asked me if I used it. I said, "No." She's like, "Ah, you totally need to. Hey, go ask it your bio. It's really cool." I said, "All right. Let's just do it on your screen," so she did and my bio said I started my career at Google, and worked on Google Trends, and a bunch of other products, none of which happened. It was just complete nonsense.

(00:25:52):
It did have some stuff that did happen. It knew I worked at Eventbrite, and it knew I worked at Pinterest and stuff, but half of it was just completely made up. It sounded plausible, but it wasn't actually true. I think where I'm more inclined for PMs to try to get leverage out of something like GPT-4 is a lot of the tedious work that's maybe not their specialty to begin with. If you're not great at Excel or Google Sheets and you need to model something, you can ask it to format something. That'll probably be perfect, or how to get some Zapier integration to work. It probably knows how to do that really well.

(00:26:28):
I think, at this point, it's a pretty good no-code to low-code tool. It's obviously going to become a lot more than that, but for a lot of these other use cases that people are touting, there's a decent chance, confidently tells you the wrong thing, and that would scare me as a PM. 

Lenny (00:26:45):
I've had the exact same experience. I had to describe what I've done, and it was like 70% mistaken. 

Casey Winters (00:26:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:26:53):
Is there anything you've found value in yet with GPT of any kind in your work, or is it still kind of just poking around and novelty for you?

Casey Winters (00:27:00):
Yeah. I've had a couple of those things where it's like, "Hey, how do I actually get this weird thing done?" It's been like clear bullet points, take these steps, and I'm like, "Oh, great. This was actually really hard to find on Google." Things like that, I actually quite like it for, so that's where my head goes to more confidently use it. Of course, I'll try it and if it's wrong-

Lenny (00:27:24):
Just throw it away. 

Casey Winters (00:27:25):
... I'll learn where it's wrong, so it's low-risk, but it's been right on some of those things and it's like, "Oh, cool. I couldn't figure out how to do that." There was something on Google Docs that I needed to figure out how to do that was kind of fancy. I asked ChatGPT. It told me how to do it, and I was like, "Oh, great." 

Lenny (00:27:39):
I had a similar experience where I just needed a formula in Google Sheets, and just told it like, "I need this thing," and it just gives me the actual formula. 

Casey Winters (00:27:45):
Yeah, that's so magical when it happens. 

Lenny (00:27:47):
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not that good with Sheets formulas. Shifting course a little bit, you also wrote this really interesting post on founder intuition versus team expertise. There's a lot to it, and I think it's a really interesting topic because it's this classic discussion that startups have. How much should a founder trust their gut, and how much should it be top-down, "Here's what we should be doing" versus the team, bottom-up, figure out what to build? I'd love to spend a little time here. Maybe just to start broadly, what is this? You came up with a framework of how to think about when founder intuition should overrule, say, team expertise, and how that change over time, so maybe just talk about that. 

Casey Winters (00:28:26):
Yeah. If founders are lucky/good enough to find product-market fit, they've usually built up all this intuition about their customers, about their product, and their business that are really hard to explain to others and may even be subconscious. When they start to hire people, these people will come in with a lot of excitement, ideas, maybe even really relevant experience, especially senior leaders. I've seen some founders are like, "Cool. I need to let these experts start to own these areas and get out of the geek house." I think that's actually the opposite of what you want, because none of these people know the business as well as you get it. You actually need to direct them until they show you they've really got it and are making better decisions than you would. 

(00:29:17):
This is not a founder example, but I remember when I hired Erika Warren to build out our loyalty program at Grubhub, and she now leads growth at Change.org. After a month or so, she was like, "Dude, you're in all my meetings. I got this." That let me know she was in a different part of the situational leadership framework than I had put her in, so I backed away, and she crushed it from there.

(00:29:40):
Founders will put a lot of new leaders in that delegate bucket too quickly. It's like, "Ah, they got it. They know more than me," when founders actually know the right answer and should just tell them. This can, of course, change like in the case of Erika. If you hire the right people, they do get smarter than you. You can and you should start delegating. Many founders don't notice the signals where their founder intuition has been usurped by team expertise, or maybe it's just ebbed in effectiveness over time. That, of course, makes sense. Founders have all these different things they're dealing with, and your employees can really dive deep in certain areas. I encourage employees to proactively signal both directions, like, "Hey, I need direction from you." Or, "Hey, I got it from here. Trust me on this one."

Lenny (00:30:27):
Interesting. You're saying, as a founder, the heuristic should be if you feel confident about a decision, generally, you should be clear, like, "Hey, I think I know what we need to be doing here," and don't just make people feel better, necessarily, by just saying, "Okay. You tell us what you want to do." Then on the flip side, as an employee at the company, if you feel really confident about something, make it clear to the founder like, "I really think this is the right move." Is there anything more you want to add there?

Casey Winters (00:30:55):
Yeah. Well, there's obviously the feedback loop of that, of what happens when you do either of those things. Depending on the founder's response to that or the employee's response to that, there's different approaches you can take.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Part of this, you have this cool chart of just over time, the founder expertise becomes less and less relevant. I guess, is that because they just don't spend as much time with the customers because they have other stuff going on or they hire people that are smarter, and then over time, the team expertise goes up?

Casey Winters (00:31:26):
If you're lucky enough to scale a company, there's just more and more things going on that all will reach the founder in some way, but it means more breadth and less depth on any particular issue, and the reverse is true for people you hire. They're able to get really deep into things that maybe you were really deep into two years ago but you just can't stay deep in anymore. I built this chart on, or I guess I should say table on the different phases of a startup. When you're finding product-market fit, everything goes through the founders. You cannot outsource that.

(00:32:08):
Then when you start scaling the company because you found product-market fit, it's the first time that founders run into this classic problem of what got you here won't get you there. What got you to product-market fit was iterating on product and doing things that don't scale. Guess what? You found a product that works. Don't do that anymore. Make it scale. Don't come up with new products. You found the one that works. The reason I came up with this framework originally is when I was at Grubhub, we were scaling pretty nicely and fairly organically. 

(00:32:39):
I think Mike and Matt, the founders, had intuited these phases of building a company pretty well, but we acquired a competitor and I saw how that company we acquired operated. Even though they were largely in the same phase as us, they still operated like they were founding the company. Everything was going through the founder. Intuitively, I was like, "Oh, this is why we're acquiring you, and not the other way around." 

(00:33:09):
I think it's really hard for founders to get those signals organically, and I think it's up to us as employees to help. The founders can listen to the signals or not listen to those signals, but that's part of why we're here, but we should also give those signals when we're confident we really get it. Not come in day one being, "I know what your sales strategy should be. You're doing it all wrong." Because chances are, the founders weren't doing it all wrong. They knew something you don't know about yet.

Lenny (00:33:34):
What is it that you think made it such that you won and they didn't? Is it because they didn't invest, they didn't shift to scaling and delegating to their employees as much as the founder just telling everyone to do it?

Casey Winters (00:33:43):
Correct, right. Everything was not moving as quickly because everything had to go through the same person to get done. It just allowed them to not launch as many markets, not sign up as many restaurants, to not figure out as many growth channels, yeah, as we had done.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Got it. They just bottlenecked themselves and they weren't able to move as fast because the founder thought they needed to make these decisions, and they were still the ones that knew everything.

Casey Winters (00:34:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:34:09):
That makes me think about most companies. Maybe not most, but many founders just believe they have the answers. They are confident they know what to do, and it's rare they get to a place of like, "Nah, I actually don't."

# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)

## Transcript

Claire Vo (00:00:00):
People often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.

Lenny (00:00:11):
Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:00:16):
I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.

Lenny (00:00:24):
There may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.

Claire Vo (00:00:27):
I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?

Lenny (00:00:38):
You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.

Claire Vo (00:00:44):
Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.

(00:02:01):

(00:04:16):
Claire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Claire Vo (00:04:20):
Oh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.

Claire Vo (00:04:32):
It's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:51):
It's absolutely my pleasure.

(00:04:53):
I want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.

(00:05:22):
Here's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?

Claire Vo (00:05:33):
Yeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.

(00:05:56):
But when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.

(00:06:20):
And so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, "Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?"

(00:06:49):
And I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, "This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD." And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, "What can I do?" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?

(00:07:33):
The other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, "I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it." And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, "What do you want out of this role?" And I said, "I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step."

(00:08:14):
And so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. "Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?"

(00:08:44):
High-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.

Lenny (00:09:24):
Maybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.

(00:09:38):
I have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. "Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there." And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, "I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level." And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?

Claire Vo (00:10:06):
Yeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.

(00:10:52):
One is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, "I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports." Instead of saying, "Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C."

(00:11:43):
That's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.

(00:12:19):
So, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, "I want to get promoted."

Lenny (00:12:41):
That is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, "Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating." I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. "Here's what I can do to move things further."

(00:13:06):
And I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.

Claire Vo (00:13:15):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:13:17):
Is there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, "Here's how I can help the org," and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.

Claire Vo (00:13:25):
It's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.

(00:14:06):
And so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.

(00:14:32):
And this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.

Lenny (00:15:08):
I love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, "Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design."

Claire Vo (00:15:31):
Yeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.

(00:15:58):
And so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.

Lenny (00:16:30):
And I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, "Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?"

Claire Vo (00:16:46):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:48):
There's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.

Claire Vo (00:16:58):
SOS.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Exactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?

Claire Vo (00:17:08):
I really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.

(00:17:32):
I truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?

(00:18:04):
And I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.

(00:18:50):
Individually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.

Lenny (00:19:21):
We're going to talk about some of the things that you built.

(00:19:23):
In terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].

Claire Vo (00:19:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, "How can I be here more?" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.

(00:20:26):
I think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.

Lenny (00:20:58):
What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:21:00):
I think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.

(00:21:31):
And the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Lenny (00:21:58):
Amazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.

(00:22:29):
Okay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?

Claire Vo (00:23:06):
Yeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.

(00:23:23):
And there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, "Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting," it's, "No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow."

(00:23:58):
The other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.

(00:24:51):
The third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, "Do both very high rate," and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.

Lenny (00:25:27):
I love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?

Claire Vo (00:25:41):
Yeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, "Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.

Lenny (00:26:26):
And then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, "Here's how I want to operate," and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.

Claire Vo (00:26:41):
Yeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, "We'll make the decision in the next meeting," or, "We'll follow up on this in the next meeting." That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.

Lenny (00:27:12):
Awesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?

Claire Vo (00:27:17):
Yeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.

(00:27:28):
I'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.

(00:27:51):
And so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, "Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar." And so I think that's very important.

(00:28:39):
The second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, "Clear is kind," I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.

(00:29:08):
I really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.

(00:29:30):
And I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Is there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, "Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?"

Claire Vo (00:30:16):
There were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.

(00:30:38):
And the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, "You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen." And I called both of them individually and I said, "The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do." And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. "I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow."

(00:31:20):
I wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility." That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.

Lenny (00:31:55):
That's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?"

Claire Vo (00:32:16):
And I honestly think saying, "You are not doing a good job," is much kinder than, "I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect." Or, "I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at..." That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.

Lenny (00:32:36):
Okay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.

Claire Vo (00:32:40):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:32:41):
This doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.

Claire Vo (00:32:58):
Yeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.

(00:33:30):
And look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.

(00:34:09):
And what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.

(00:34:47):
And as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, "Oh, she did associate and all the way up," but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, "Don't get pregnant," when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.

(00:35:21):
And I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.

(00:35:46):
And the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?

(00:36:24):
And then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Is there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, "Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?"

Claire Vo (00:37:21):
I've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, "Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person."

(00:38:11):
And I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.

Lenny (00:38:50):
And this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?

Claire Vo (00:39:02):
One, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, "My grandma's a software engineer?"

(00:39:35):
Books called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.

(00:40:00):
The reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.

# 10 growth tactics that never work | Elena Verna (Amplitude, Miro, Dropbox, SurveyMonkey)

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
Growth is a fairly new field. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
We're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:00:26):
We live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
Powerful words. I'm loving this list already.

Elena Verna (00:00:45):
Number two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
A lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.

Elena Verna (00:01:14):
Number three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down. If you spend any time working on product growth or lead people or work with people working on growth, this episode is for you.

This episode is brought to you by Sinch the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications, whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS, think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies.

(00:03:22):
And here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.

(00:04:40):
Elena, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast, our first ever third-time repeat guest. What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, "Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world"

Elena Verna (00:05:23):
Thank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
That needs to be my KPI on this podcast, "Insights per minute."

Elena Verna (00:05:40):
I think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):
That is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.

Elena Verna (00:05:54):
It's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
Already insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.

Elena Verna (00:06:36):
Growth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.

(00:07:35):
There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, "Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth." And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Amazing. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:08:34):
Number one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.

(00:09:17):
We live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.

(00:10:09):
That just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.

(00:10:35):
And there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Just to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.

Elena Verna (00:12:06):
Yes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, "They're going to be growing," and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
As you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?

Elena Verna (00:12:42):
It depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.

(00:13:23):
You're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
That's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.

Elena Verna (00:14:11):
Right. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
We talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.

Elena Verna (00:14:53):
I need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
I love that.

Elena Verna (00:14:55):
I need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.

Elena Verna (00:15:09):
Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):
Excellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?

Elena Verna (00:15:13):
No, let's move on to number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Let's do it.

Elena Verna (00:15:16):
Number two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, "Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate." That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.

(00:16:03):
Growth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
Wow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it

Elena Verna (00:16:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
If your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.

Elena Verna (00:16:59):
Disappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.

(00:17:45):
It's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, "We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Then for folks that are thinking about, "Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth," when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,

Elena Verna (00:18:33):
If you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):
Awesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.

Elena Verna (00:19:23):
Number three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.

(00:20:22):
It's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, "What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here." And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.

(00:21:10):
And it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):
Oh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.

Elena Verna (00:22:19):
Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.

Elena Verna (00:22:53):
Product redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
And to your point, it's like, "We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back." That's how it goes.

Elena Verna (00:23:26):
It's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):
And I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive." In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?

Elena Verna (00:24:15):
The best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.

(00:24:38):
The goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):
I love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.

Elena Verna (00:25:13):
Okay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.

(00:25:45):
So knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, "Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful."

(00:26:20):
That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. "Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it." And it fails 95% of the time.

(00:27:08):
Now, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, "Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.

(00:27:40):
I also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, "Oh, these elements are always the same." That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.

(00:28:04):
And you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.

(00:28:37):
The only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.

(00:29:21):
So all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, "This is where we should be," is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
You're telling me that there's no shortcuts?

Elena Verna (00:30:10):
I wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration." It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, "Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea."

Elena Verna (00:30:41):
I use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, "Hey, can you share this with somebody?" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, "Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it."

(00:31:19):
I use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, "Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go," or, "Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us." So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.

(00:32:00):
But they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, "Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point."

(00:32:22):
And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"

Elena Verna (00:33:02):
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.

Elena Verna (00:33:48):
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.

Elena Verna (00:33:59):
Whole other podcasts, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):
Okay, number five.

Elena Verna (00:34:02):
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.

(00:34:49):
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?

(00:35:41):
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.

(00:36:26):
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
Let's make it a word.

Elena Verna (00:36:44):
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?

Elena Verna (00:37:37):
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"

(00:38:02):
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.

(00:38:29):
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.

(00:39:19):
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.

# The ultimate guide to product-led sales | Elena Verna

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
The most important thing in product-led sales is that there is a different configuration internally of collaboration that needs to occur. In traditional sales world, marketing creates pipeline for sales. Sales sells product. Product engages with a paid user to drive retention. In the product-led sales, product acquires and activates a customer and product creates pipeline for sales, so relationship is not that there's a go-to-market org with marketing and sales and product just kind of throws features across the fence for them to sell. 

(00:00:40):
The collaboration here is between product and sales, but that means the product has to take on accountability over pipeline. The worst thing that you can do is to say, "I'm going to do product-led growth," or, "I'm going to do product-led sales and I'm going to do it in marketing." Recipe for disaster. You'll be failure mode within six months because product has to take accountability over selling of the product itself. 

Lenny (00:01:09):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Elena Verna. If that name sounds familiar, Elena is a return guest and you be the judge, but I think this episode is even better than the first, which is a very high bar because that first episode continues to be one of the most popular of the podcast. Elena has worked at or advised companies like Miro, Amplitude, SurveyMonkey, MongoDB, Netlify, and a dozen others. She's also a longtime instructor and EIR at Reforge where she helped create their experimentation, monetization, growth, leadership, and their soon-to-be released PLG course. 

(00:01:51):
In this conversation, we go incredibly deep into the emerging space of product-led sales. Elena explains what exactly is product-led sales, how it fits together with product-led growth and sales-led growth, who and when you should consider investing product-led sales, how product-led sales changes your approach to sales and marketing, what sorts of data, tooling, and people you need in place to do it well, and what common pitfalls you need to avoid. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Elena is possibly the smartest and most experienced growth person in the world, especially when it comes to B2B, and I never get tired of learning from her. Enjoy this episode with Elena Verna after a short word from our sponsors.

Elena, welcome back to the podcast.

Elena Verna (00:05:09):
Thank you for having me back. I thought I would be the first returning guest. I'm a little bit upset that I am been beat by Casey, so you should explain yourself on that one.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Okay, here's the explanation. You're the first that we rebooked back and then this one just kind of got pushed a little bit and Casey had a slot earlier, so technically you were the first scheduled return guest.

Elena Verna (00:05:31):
All right, all right. I'll accept that.

Lenny (00:05:34):
Okay, great. I'm off the hook. I guess I'll just say I am really excited to have you back. Your episode that we did maybe a year ago is still one of the most popular episodes of all time. I still see people tweeting about it and sharing it, and so I am really excited to have you back and have a take two.

Elena Verna (00:05:48):
I'm excited to be back. Let's dive in.

Lenny (00:05:51):
Before we get into the content, when we met last time you were Interim Head of Growth at Amplitude. What are you up to now? What's happened in the past year?

Elena Verna (00:06:00):
I just wrapped up interim gig at Amplitude in February, so it's just been a couple of months since then. I'm passively exploring if I'm going to take another interim position, but between interim roles I always take about six to eight months of break because interim rolls are very intense because there's so many deliverables that are loaded in in the first year that you're working at the company, so I'm just advising. I have incredible companies that I started advising such as Veed.io and Sanity and Clockwise, and I'm building up my next level of frameworks that I'm going to dive into potentially a new interim position to prototype.

Lenny (00:06:38):
Ooh. If people are listening to this and they're like, "How do I get to work with Elena?", should people reach out to you? Are you booked up? What do you suggest?

Elena Verna (00:06:47):
I'll never take down an opportunity to have a great conversation and to learn about the business and to see how I can be helpful, but I'm not proactively sourcing clients, but that doesn't mean that I don't have availability to schedule something in the future.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Awesome, so if it's amazing enough, you're open to it?

Elena Verna (00:07:05):
Absolutely, always. 

Lenny (00:07:06):
Okay, great. Okay, here we go. Great [inaudible 00:07:07]-

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
I always have to be-

Lenny (00:07:08):
... [inaudible 00:07:08].

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
... open to new opportunities, yes.

Lenny (00:07:10):
I love that. I feel the same way. FOMO. FOMO kicks in. Anyway, as you know, we're going to be devoting this entire podcast to just one topic, which is product-led sales, which is this go-to-market motion that seems to have emerged over the past year maybe a bit longer and just feels like there's this increasing amount of interest and also this increasing amount of confusion around what it is, how to approach it, who it's right for. We're going to spend the next hour diving really deep into product-led sales.

Elena Verna (00:07:39):
Let's go for it.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Let's do it. Okay, so let's just start with a bigger picture kind of question of just, how do you define product-led sales? What is product-led sales, especially when it comes to what is it versus product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:07:54):
Great question, so let's start with product-led growth. We've talked about it a little bit in our first episode, but let's revisit the topic. Product led growth is all about product's ability to self-serve activate, self-serve engage, and convert that usage to a monetization opportunity. You bring people, you get them to an aha moment into the habit loops, and then you able to extract value back out of them. Extraction of the value can be direct where you're actually capturing revenue from them, or it can be indirect where they're participating in your growth model via virality or user-generated content and bring additional business through the doors. 

(00:08:34):
Let's talk about direct phase to capture that value. There's self-serve monetization, so I'm using product self-serve. I go to the pricing page. I find the plan that best suits me on features that I want to unlock or usage that I want to unlock and I buy it. However, that's not the only way to monetize that usage. You can monetize that usage with sales, too. Why? Self-serve monetization has a cap of about $10,000. That's just how much we're able to process on the credit cards before they start getting flagged and declined by the banks and how much we as a consumers and prosumers are even willing to put on our credit card because not all credit cards have limits of over 10, 20, 30, $40,000. 

(00:09:15):
Self-serve monetization is very much a prosumer use case where an individual is trying to solve the problem on their own. Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract, which can be 15, 20, a hundred thousand dollars in order to bring an enterprise-level solution to a company that has already been using it in a self-serve manner.

Lenny (00:09:44):
Amazing. Would you say that product-led growth has always been in a sense product-led sales because sales was involved and theirs has been kind of like way of describing it? Or is this a new trend and way of approaching product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:09:59):
Product-led growth has actually started more on individual use case-

Lenny (00:10:06):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:06):
... so an individual has a problem. They have a job to be done. They come into the product and they solve it, and that was product-led growth in a nutshell for a lot of the B2B companies. However, if you're going to attach a salesperson, there is nobody in the company that is going to pay 10, 15, $20,000 for one individual to solve their problem. Product-led sales assumes that there's a migration from an individual use case that you acquired an end user with and an escalation into an enterprise-level solution that solves enterprise-level problems. Let me break it down and let me use just, for example, Amplitude as an example.

Lenny (00:10:46):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:47):
Amplitude, individual, what is individual wanted with Amplitude? I need data at my fingertips to make better decisions for my product, so I'm going to put an Amplitude SDK into my product and it gives me behavioral data to help me build my pillar better. What is the company-level solution? Well, it's more self-serve ability of the data. It's democratization of data. It's enhanced insights in the more data-driven culture. That's what company's solving for. Individual is not solving for data-driven culture. Individual is just solving for data insights for them. Company's solving for data-driven culture.

(00:11:25):
In product-led growth, you can just have an individual be very happy with their solution for their job to be done. However, what product-led sales assumes is that there is an escalator to an enterprise-level solution, and enterprise escalator is valuable to attach sales resources to because products fundamentally do a really bad job at communicating enterprise-level value prop. They're very good at showing you as a user what you can do. They've very terrible at showing what organization actually can benefit out of the solution.

(00:12:02):
Sales can tell that story. Sales can bridge that gap, and then you can increase the perceived value in order to bridge the gap to that $15,000, 20, hundred-thousand dollar contract. I would say self-serve monetization is very much an individual use case versus product-led sales is turning that individual use case and self-serve usage into a sales pipeline with enterprise-level value.

Lenny (00:12:28):
I really like that way of thinking about it. Basically product-led growth has a ceiling. You're only going to get-

Elena Verna (00:12:32):
Yes.

Lenny (00:12:33):
... so high in terms of spend. You can only explain things so much to a potential user and then sales comes in and solves a lot of those problems, and product-led sales is essentially this. I think you even have this visualization now that I'm thinking about-

Elena Verna (00:12:33):
It's a bridge.

Lenny (00:12:45):
... as a bridge. Right, yeah, this bridge between the two, and so in this world of product-led sales, does sales as a function, outbound sales, continue to exist? One, and then two, is it radically different in this world of product-led sales?

Elena Verna (00:12:59):
Yeah, so to understand how sales should be applied in the situation, you need to understand end user's motivation, ability, and permission. Simple organization, so for example, if the end user is very motivated, they have full sense of ability to solve the problem and they have all of the permission from organization, or maybe not even permission, maybe forgiveness from organization, to go and explore and bring in a new solution. Then, it can be a very much organic motion up that escalator. However, that's not always the case. A lot of times the end users miss permission of solving enterprise-level problems. There's lots of stakeholders, there's a committee that has to make a decision. It impacts departments outside of their purview and maybe they even lack ability to do it. Maybe they can do their little job to be done, but not the entire enterprise-level integration. 

(00:13:55):
In my Amplitude example, yeah, I can drop an SDK in my product area, but how do I convince entire product to adopt Amplitude and put an SDK on every single interaction across the entire app? There is different level problem statements, and this is where product-led sales is either can be a truly organic motion where people raise their hands, they submit sales forms and there's already a need, a desire, an understanding of it, or end user might hit friction points. Product-led sales has to bridge those friction points by either attracting the right decision-makers to the process so they can find an enterprise buyer out there. They can understand who's the champion and what their capabilities and what their permission levels are. They can create a committee for the decision.

(00:14:46):
There is... They almost slap a bandaid on the problem of people not be able to and not wanting to necessarily resolve the problem on their own. They can be very powerful with that as well as marketing because we cannot forget about marketing where they can educate of how to help people bridge that gap and how to sell things internally.

Lenny (00:15:06):
You mentioned this idea of enterprise-level problems. It might help if you give an example or two of what those might be. Then, also, just what are examples of companies that are doing enterprise or product-led sales well just to kind of give people a mental model as you're talking about some of this stuff?

Elena Verna (00:15:22):
Sure, so let's go through a couple of them. Let's go through Miro. Miro is an online whiteboarding platform. What is individual problem that people come to Miro to solve? They have a workshop they need to facilitate. Maybe they need a board to just do brainwriting in and they use Miro for individual jobs to be done. However, what Miro is designed for is a team-level problem. I come in and I bring you in and we collaborate together, so now there's two, three, four people involved, but even that is still on the project level, it's on the team level. Nobody's going to pay a hundred thousand dollars to solve a team-level small problem that is solving. What is the enterprise-level problem? It's increased innovation, it's increased productivity across the entire team because now we have this new outlet in which we can collaborate. 

(00:16:10):
Now, can Miro very clearly show increase in productivity across the organization by using the product? No. Can sales tell the story? Yes. Miro takes you from an individual user to a team step, and then sales bridges the gap to an enterprise. Let's give another example of Figma. In Figma, I come in as a designer and I just need a better way to capture feedback from my stakeholders, a more scalable way to capture it so I can iterate on the perfect design. What is it at the team level? Now there is a team that can collaborate with me more openly. I can capture more feedback from more stakeholders faster and get the project done sooner.

(00:16:53):
What is it on the enterprise level? Well, on enterprise level, our designs are just better fit the business needs. They have faster turnaround time and our product is performing better. That's an enterprise-level value prop and, again, we're, I think, in the product development space gotten a little bit lazy of actually showcasing that enterprise value in product. We rely on excellence of sales team to tell that story. I do hope that changes, by the way, in the future, that we put more pressure on the products to take it all the way up the escalator so we don't have to be a hundred percent dependent on the sales team going and showcasing that story. The product can really empower that escalator from the starting point till the end on its own.

Lenny (00:17:42):
I want to dig into that for sure. I know that's something you just shared on LinkedIn recently and I thought that was a really interesting topic, but before we get there, let's talk about this bridge a little bit more. People might be listening to this that are maybe a product-led growth company and they may feel like, "Hey, wait, we're already doing this. We have this product-led growth motion, we have a sales team. They figure out who to talk to." What exactly is in that bridge that makes product-led sales so interesting? I imagine it's like helping you identify who to go after, helping people go further and further and escalate it themselves. How do you think about that bridge between product and sales?

Elena Verna (00:18:15):
Let's talk about how product-led growth companies start with product-led sales. It usually starts by an organic demand from a user base. They reach out to them through support channels by just pinging people who work at the company saying, "Hey, I want to purchase this for my entire company." That's an organic pool that you start feeling from product-led growth model into enterprise sales world and, by the way, you should never hire any salespeople until you feel that pool because if nobody's asking to purchase, then you cannot just hire an SDR and make a purchase happen. You need to see those hand-raisers, you need to see those people demanding an enterprise-level adoption. Then, you hire starts hiring salespeople to actually suffice that demand and that's great, and you're starting to do sales and surfacing really addressing organic demand within your product.

(00:19:11):
That organic demand very quickly dries up if you rely on hand-raisers of your champions. If you rely on having enterprise buyers in your user base that are asking to just sign on the dotted line, then you have a very limited ceiling for your growth because what majority of the usage transforms to be is to have product qualification that there's a meaningful sales conversation that could occur based on the signals within usage that the buyer is missing. 90% of product-led sales is converting the usage into an opportunity by finding a buyer outside, by finding the decision-maker outside. This is where marketing and sales are so crucial in the process. Connecting that decision-maker to the usage and then driving an opportunity through sales funnel all the way to closed one deal.

(00:20:08):
It's great when you start having sales team and you're surfacing this organic demand. That's beautiful and power to you. Just it doesn't last very long just because end user fundamentally does not equal enterprise buyer and that organic demand ends up plateauing very shortly because you cannot just make enterprise buyers happen from your users.

Lenny (00:20:31):
If a founder is listening to this right now and they're like, "Okay, so I have maybe a product-led growth component, they're self-serve, maybe I have a sales team, maybe I don't," what's a sign that your product is a fit for investing in product-led sales? Essentially every product-led growth-oriented company should be eventually investing in this area. Or is there certain companies that are like, "No, you don't need to worry about it, just stay product-led growth forever or just stay sales-led growth forever?"

Elena Verna (00:20:57):
To have product-led sales means you're going upmarket-

Lenny (00:21:02):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:21:04):
... period. That means you going for contract values that are probably over your sales floor, so the minimum that the sales is willing to engage and close, which is traditionally around $15,000. If you're going for contract values of $15,000, that means you're probably trying to close a hundred, $200,000 contracts as well. Who can handle a hundred, $200,000 contract? It's not going to be a small startup. It's not going to be an SMB. It's probably going to be higher end of more of a mid-market segment, so 200 employees-plus. More likely it's going to be towards the enterprise segment of a thousand employees-plus. 

(00:21:45):
If you are not ready to go upmarket, I would say keep it easy on the product-led sales because sales means quotas. Sales means large contract values. Sales means you are going upmarket whether you like it or not, and some products, they should stay in the prosumer individual space. Maybe they're geared towards contractors or freelancers or squarely towards startups. Those persons are not interested in talking to sales in the first place. They have much lower bearing of how much they're willing to spend, so their price sensitivity is much higher. They prefer to do all self-serve in the first place, so it's really need to be conscious about what that will do to your go-to-market motion because it definitely skews it and pulls it up. 

Lenny (00:22:36):
Got it, so what I'm hearing is that if you're starting as a self-serve-oriented product and you're starting to maybe hire for a salesperson, is the approach start approaching it from product-led sales motion versus now we're going to add the sales independent team that's kind of doing their own thing?

Elena Verna (00:22:55):
Right, so there's two ways to get to product-led sales. First little wave is that we talked about, I start as product-led growth company. I really started with this individual use case and I'm escalating to a company-level value prop and this is what I need product-led sales for. On the other side, I might start as a top-down sales traditional organization, so I have product that I only sell through sales. Those are usually anchored at larger segments in the first place. In order to build a top-down sales engine, you're most likely going after enterprise segment of a thousand-plus employees or maybe upper mid-market of 500 employees-plus. The reason to go into product-led sales is either your existing top-down motion is not working because customers need to see value before they sign the contract. They want to see that usage and at least the first signs of perceived value before they sign on the dotted line.

(00:23:49):
Or you're going downmarket and your fixed cost of sale that you have from the traditional sales motion does not scale. It stays fairly constant, yet your contract values are starting to drop as you're doing downmarket, so you want to create a lot more automation in the selling process to remove as many as possible humans out of it. You can approach it from both ways. Adding PLS on top of product-led growth or adding PLS on top of existing sales-led growth. For PLG, you're going upmarket by adding PLS. For SLG or sales-led growth, by adding PLS you're going downmarket.  

Lenny (00:24:27):
Awesome, and we're going to talk about how to actually build this infrastructure and what's required, but it reminds me one of the biggest takeaways from our first podcast and something I've quoted many times now, is your bet that every sales-led growth company needs to add a product-led growth element. Otherwise, they'll be disrupted by someone that does. Is that still your perspective?

Elena Verna (00:24:49):
Absolutely. Now, I think there's different stages of, what does it mean to add product-led growth elements? I think every sales-led company should be putting pressure on product to assist with the sales process. That does not mean that there is product-led growth, but there is a product assist in the existing sales-led motion that can materialize into product-led growth if you can truly solve for self-serve activation, self-serve engagement, and have product be able to sell itself. The biggest difference here that starts to come in, and that is so apparent in every single company, is that in B2B, unfortunately, we've let go of the products having accountability over monetization model. We've gotten into the spiral of product just builds a product and it throws it over the fence to marketing and sales to sell.

(00:25:38):
Marketing and sales have done an incredible job over the last couple of decades of coming up with these stories and elaborate playbooks of how to attract enterprise buyers and how to sell them this product. Product literally only obsesses after contract is closed and there's usage that starts materialize after contract close. We've alleviated our product management in B2B from monetization ownership. When a SLG company actually goes into product-assisted tactics or product-led growth, the biggest pain point is actually educating product team on how can you get product to sell itself, which is all about monetization awareness, monetization friction of conversion to get into the paid plan, and then having actual correct value metrics that are understood self-serve by the customer.

(00:26:29):
I mean, yes, I agree with you. Every single... I agree with myself, so I should say that every single sales-led company should at least add some product-assisted tactics, but I would even take it further that every sales-led company should start educating and putting pressure on the product to own monetization components of the business.

Lenny (00:26:50):
Let's pull on that thread a little bit more. What does that actually look like? Does the head of product for that or the head of product or specific group PMs, let's say, have revenue goals and responsible for P&L and things like that? Or what does that generally look like when they start to own revenue?

Elena Verna (00:27:08):
There's two ways that you can own revenue. Revenue stream one will be your self-serve revenue, and if there's self-serve revenue, that means product is selling literally itself, so yes, there has to be somebody in product that has self-serve revenue target. 

Lenny (00:27:26):
Hmm.

Elena Verna (00:27:27):
Now, a lot of times it doesn't fall in the core product managers. A lot of times it falls on the growth team, and that's because core product management is really focused on feature deliverability and just that incremental expansion of the core use case, and growth product management owns the product distribution strategy. Then, the PLG case, it would be a true self-serve monetization model. Now, when it comes to PLS, you don't own revenue target in my opinion, but what you do own is the pipeline that was created by product that you have a handshake with sales team over.

(00:28:02):
What that materializes in is product qualified accounts, and it's actually a product threshold of engagement that differs from activation and it differs from core engagement. It's what volume, velocity, feature breadth, or behavioral signals that account is throwing that says, "Hey, right now is the time to engage with sales." That is the bridge to monetization, that product team should own as a... even on the core team in order to drive a healthy, predictable, and sustainable pipeline to sales. 

Lenny (00:28:38):
Okay, so this is a really important topic. There's this concept you just described, product qualified account. It might be a good time to define a couple other acronyms and kind of compare them. THere's PQA, there's PQL, product-qualified lead. There's marketing-qualified lead. Can you just maybe describe the suite of acronyms? Then, I want to follow up on the PQA because that seems really important.

Elena Verna (00:28:59):
I'll start with PQA just because we just breezed over it. PQA is product-qualified account. It's on account level, it's aggregation of multiple users that are using the account. It might be on the overall logo level, so let's say you've attracted a company, so you qualify PQA across the entire company usage, or it might be on a specific team or workspace level depending on what is the better predictor for you and who the sales team is going to be engaging with. Product qualification is very much product metrics. It's the volume of use, it's the velocity change. For example, yesterday I've been adding one user per day and then today I've added 15 users to account. That's a velocity change that you need to pay attention to. Or there is a feature usage that can be highly correlative to enterprise interest. That product should be driving towards every single account reaching in order to qualify them for sales conversation.

(00:30:00):
Now, within the PQA, there may or may not be PQL, so PQL is a product-qualified lead. Lead assumes there is a person in the account that I can go and sell to. Now, leads are those buyers. They're those decision-makers in the account, and if you have a smaller segment, so for example you had more in small businesses or lower end of mid-market segment, you may very have PQLs in there because user is maybe equals buyer. User can make those buyer decisions. However, the more you move up the market, the more end user is many steps separated from the buyer, so you might have very healthy usage and you might have a PQA that is off the charts, but you don't have a PQL in it.

(00:30:47):
If you just stick your sales against that account, you're going to have a very terrible situation and very terrible user journey where users are like, "Why is sales talking to me? I have no decision-making power in my organization. I love the product, but please leave me alone." This is where you get a bunch of cold outbound, and I put big quotations on outbound emails that are just not getting returned. You need to very clearly understand who's your buying persona and, are they in your user base? If they are, you have a PQL. Pass them, go for it, but if they're not, go find it out there. This is where MQL concept really comes into play because then marketing has to still qualify a lead to bring it and connect it to PQA. PQA can have a PQL as a user already in the user base, or you might need an MQL with marketing or sales, bringing their lead over and connecting them with the usage.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Amazing, so we're going to share a link. You have this awesome visual that shows kind of like the funnel of PQAs and PQLs funneling into sales along with marketing qualified leads. Basically there's a kind of instead of one path to sales, knowing who to talk to, now there's two. Product is funneling you people that are qualified, and then marketing following you people that are qualified.

Elena Verna (00:32:06):
There is a third path. There might be a marketing funneling people that have no usage whatsoever and that is a true top-down lead, so you have three buckets of lead attribution that is coming in. I have usage and one of the users is my lead. I have usage. I have no lead in the account. Marketing is bringing me the lead, but I have to leverage that usage against that lead or have a lead coming through, there is no usage. I have to sell the entire thing still to them, so there's no context that I can use of existing usage. Those three channels are super important to identify. They all have very different conversion rates. They all have different playbooks of how you close them and, honestly, they require often different sales team to go after them because it's a very different sales enablement. 

Lenny (00:32:51):
You remind me of... You have so many hilarious memes that you share on LinkedIn. By the way, everyone listening should go follow Elena on LinkedIn and subscribe to our newsletter because it's hilarious and also informative. It's a magical combination. One of my favorite memes of yours is The Shining one that we just kind of touched on where someone's-

Elena Verna (00:33:09):
Oh.

Lenny (00:33:09):
... just using a product for five minutes and then, "Hey, do you want to," a sales guy just reaches out with the ax, "Hey, do you want to chat?"

Elena Verna (00:33:18):
That actually... It's painfully true. That's one of my most highly engaged memes that I've put out there. I have also one of the urinals where the man-

Lenny (00:33:28):

... "enterprise plan?"

Lenny (00:33:33):
... it's like 10 urinals and he's right next to yours. 

Elena Verna (00:33:36):
Yeah, exactly, so the piece here that a lot of companies miss, unfortunately, is that they jam product-led sales into a traditional top-down sales playbook. Now, what does that mean? In traditional top-down sales book, an MQL that you have or a lead that you gather already is in consideration cycles for your enterprise-level offering. However, in product-led sales, a new user that signs up, they know we're close to enterprise-level consideration. They're just trying to complete an individual job to be done. They're not solving a problem for their company. If you can imagine, it is like a very large funnel. You start with just users looking for problem solve. Then, you transition to awareness, consideration, and intent channels for team level problem. Then, you escalate for awareness, consideration, and intent channels for enterprise-level problem.

(00:34:41):
Top-down sales process goes after the bottom of that funnel where there's already an intent to solve company-level problem versus at the very top is where product-led growth starts on individual-level problem. It's a different timeline. If you go after individual user that just signs up for the account and you reach out to them 10 minutes later after sign-up asking, "What's your budget and are you ready to buy?", it's a complete mismatch of where they are in their consideration journey. You cannot consider a new product sign-up an MQL in the traditional sense. They're just not there yet. They have a fraction of the enterprise problem that they're solving and they're not ready to buy.

Lenny (00:35:26):
That's especially annoying because there's so many SaaS products now and everyone is coming for you, especially if you're at an awesome company that they're trying to sell, so got to be [inaudible 00:35:34]-

I mean, I don't know, I can't even notice anything in that outbound [inaudible 00:35:52] unless somebody reaches out to me with something authentic that is already usage- based, it's ignore.

Lenny (00:35:59):
It's going to get worse with GPT-oriented cold outbound emails. Oh my God.

Elena Verna (00:35:59):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:36:05):
This episode is brought to you by rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone, and if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are a nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from Bitquery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter.

(00:36:52):
Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into Rows. When you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:37:17):
Okay, so let's shift to actually, how do you actually do this? How do you actually build a system of product-led sales? I feel like there's maybe three buckets. There's, what data do you need? What infrastructure systems do you need in place? Then, what are the people you need in place and how do you resource it? Maybe let's start with the data. What sort of data do you need in order to do this well?

Elena Verna (00:37:36):
There's different levels of scale on how you should be attacking this problem. First of all, it starts with just top-down intuition. What are the signals that you're seeing around the accounts that are highly correlative to sales being very excited-

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
Growth is a fairly new field. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
We're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:00:26):
We live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
Powerful words. I'm loving this list already.

Elena Verna (00:00:45):
Number two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
A lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.

Elena Verna (00:01:14):
Number three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down. If you spend any time working on product growth or lead people or work with people working on growth, this episode is for you.

(00:04:40):
Elena, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast, our first ever third-time repeat guest. What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, "Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world"

Elena Verna (00:05:23):
Thank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):
That needs to be my KPI on this podcast, "Insights per minute."

Elena Verna (00:05:40):
I think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):
That is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.

Elena Verna (00:05:54):
It's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
Already insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.

Elena Verna (00:06:36):
Growth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.

(00:07:35):
There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, "Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth." And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Amazing. What's number one?

Elena Verna (00:08:34):
Number one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.

(00:09:17):
We live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.

(00:10:09):
That just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.

(00:10:35):
And there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Just to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.

Elena Verna (00:12:06):
Yes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, "They're going to be growing," and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
As you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?

Elena Verna (00:12:42):
It depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.

(00:13:23):
You're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
That's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.

Elena Verna (00:14:11):
Right. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
We talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.

Elena Verna (00:14:53):
I need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
I love that.

Elena Verna (00:14:55):
I need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.

Elena Verna (00:15:09):
Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):
Excellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?

Elena Verna (00:15:13):
No, let's move on to number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Let's do it.

Elena Verna (00:15:16):
Number two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, "Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate." That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.

(00:16:03):
Growth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
Wow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it

Elena Verna (00:16:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
If your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.

Elena Verna (00:16:59):
Disappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.

(00:17:45):
It's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, "We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Then for folks that are thinking about, "Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth," when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,

Elena Verna (00:18:33):
If you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):
Awesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.

Elena Verna (00:19:23):
Number three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.

(00:20:22):
It's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, "What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here." And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.

(00:21:10):
And it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):
Oh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.

Elena Verna (00:22:19):
Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.

Elena Verna (00:22:53):
Product redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
And to your point, it's like, "We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back." That's how it goes.

Elena Verna (00:23:26):
It's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):
And I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... is working on something like this is probably thinking, "No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive." In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?

Elena Verna (00:24:15):
The best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.

(00:24:38):
The goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):
I love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.

Elena Verna (00:25:13):
Okay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.

(00:25:45):
So knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, "Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful."

(00:26:20):
That's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. "Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it." And it fails 95% of the time.

(00:27:08):
Now, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, "Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.

(00:27:40):
I also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, "Oh, these elements are always the same." That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.

(00:28:04):
And you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.

(00:28:37):
The only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.

(00:29:21):
So all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, "This is where we should be," is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
You're telling me that there's no shortcuts?

Elena Verna (00:30:10):
I wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration." It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, "Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea."

Elena Verna (00:30:41):
I use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, "Hey, can you share this with somebody?" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, "Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it."

(00:31:19):
I use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, "Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go," or, "Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us." So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.

(00:32:00):
But they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, "Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point."

(00:32:22):
And this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
What made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, "What are you guys even thinking?"

Elena Verna (00:33:02):
Oh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, "Oh, I looked." It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, "Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company." I'm like, "We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there." So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Right, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.

Elena Verna (00:33:48):
If people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
Oh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.

Elena Verna (00:33:59):
Whole other podcasts, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):
Okay, number five.

Elena Verna (00:34:02):
Okay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.

(00:34:49):
So my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?

(00:35:41):
Well, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, "How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.

(00:36:26):
And then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
Let's make it a word.

Elena Verna (00:36:44):
Make patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
Bam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?

Elena Verna (00:37:37):
I'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, "Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?"

(00:38:02):
So I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.

(00:38:29):
So I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, "Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, "I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only." And she's like, "Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first." She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.

(00:39:19):
So I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, "Hey, I need help," and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, "I don't know how to do this." And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):
And the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.

Jackie, I am so excited that we are chatting again. We've done a bunch of fire set chats over the years in various events, and you've always been really generous with your time. I just want to say thank you for joining me. And I'm really excited to chat again.

Jackie Bavaro (03:01):
Yeah. I'm so excited to chat with you. I'm so excited that you're doing a podcast and I'm glad I get to be one of the early people on it.

Lenny (03:08):
Absolutely. It's my honor. Okay. You are a famous PM in the world of product management. You rode Cracking the PM Interview, Cracking the PM Career, both of which I own and love. And fun fact, my sister was just interviewing as a PM and she used your book and found it, really helpful. So thank you for that.

Jackie Bavaro (03:08):
That's awesome.

Lenny (03:26):
Yeah. And then also you've written a bunch of classic PM post on Medium that I reference often share with people. And also you were the first PM at Asana ended up being the head of product management at Asana. And that's actually where I left to start. Could you just share how you got into product very early on and then how you worked your way up to the head of product management at Asana?

Jackie Bavaro (03:47):
Yeah. I was just really lucky in finding product management. I went to Cornell, studied computer science and economics, and I'd never heard of the job. One of my friends who'd been a PM intern the summer before I was like, "Jackie, you have to apply for this internship." And I said, "I'm sophomore. I can't be a manager." And they're like, "No, you manage the product, not the people and just go apply." I applied having no idea at all what the job was. Through the interviews, I tried to figure it out. I loved the interview questions. I thought they were a lot of fun and got the job, became an intern on Microsoft SharePoint services and stayed with the team. Loved that team. Went there full time. When I moved to New York, that I started to think about changing companies.

(04:29):
Microsoft didn't have any product management in New York. So I applied to Google and I was like, "Yes, I'm a good product manager. I'm sure I'll get this job." And I got rejected. And I was shocked. I really had thought that I would pass the interview. A year later I applied again and that's when I got into the Google APM program. And of course at the time I thought this was one of the biggest mistakes in my whole career. But looking back, it certainly is what gave me the impetus to write these books and say, "You know what? Even good PMs don't know how to answer these questions. There's a lot we can do to help." And beyond that also then when I be joined Google, I very quickly got sent into being an interviewer. And immediately I noticed there was this real difference in how people would answer the questions.

(05:08):
And some people didn't seem to understand what the question was trying to get at. And some people sounded really good because they'd say, "Well, I'll tell you three things. Number one, number two, number three." And then when I paid attention to my notes, I'd be like, "Wait, their three ideas weren't actually good ideas. They just sounded like they knew what they were doing." Those really drove me to want to share more about how to do well in these interviews.

(05:28):
And at the same time, I constantly had people saying, "Jackie, my friend's applying to Google,. Can you talk to them?" And I was like, "Sure, of course. I'll like tell them what we're looking for." And I'll help them understand the interview process. And after doing this three times, I was like, wait a second, "If it's only my friends of a friend who are people who work at Stanford and are already very privileged and I'm telling them how to pass these interviews, that's not fair."

(05:51):
If I'm willing to tell it to a friend of a friend, I have to be willing to put that out on the internet and share that with everyone, because we really want to level the playing field that we don't want to make things more unfair.

(05:59):
While I was at Google, one day, I get an email from a friend, from an engineer I'd worked with at Microsoft. And he's like, "Hey, you want to grab coffee?" And I was like, "Oh, cool, sure. I'll be friendly." And at the time I did not realize that that's how all these recruiting chats start. I honestly did not realize that this was like, "I'm being recruited." I thought it was like, let's just catch up. But I said, "Yes." And then he told me about this company and he is like, "Hey, it's like, imagine if SharePoint was really fast." And I was like, "Oh." I love SharePoint, and I would love to work on a fast version of that. And that's how I ended up moving over and becoming the first product manager at Asana and achieve.

Lenny (06:32):
There's so many things I want to pull on in what you just shared there. On the book, an interesting point you made is that you wrote the book because it was something you were struggling with and then you saw a lot of other people struggling with it. And I find that that's often the case. When you look at books, people have written or posts, it's just like, "Oh, I had this question and this a way for me to get better at it by forcing myself to write about it." Is that basically what happened?

Jackie Bavaro (06:53):
Yeah. I had this belief that almost anybody can learn anything. People have different interests, not everybody wants to learn everything. But I find that if you're having trouble learning something, it's just because something's not clicking. There's just something that you're misunderstanding or that other people see that you're not seeing. And if people could just describe it in the way that matched YOUR mental model, then you could learn it.

(07:13):
That's how I feel about this interviewing. Is that the reason that some people don't do as well as they could on interviews is just because a lot of these interview questions are trick questions. When they say, "Oh, how would you design a bathroom?" I used to think that meant, "What do you want in a bathroom?" And that's not what it means at all. It means "Who is the best customer for a bathroom? What would they want?" But if you haven't been trained in this, you wouldn't know.

Lenny (07:34):
We're definitely going to talk about interviewing and career and come back to these topics. But going back to Asana, you look at this journey that you took and it sounds amazing and it went great, and someone that's starting out, they may feel like, "Man, how am I ever going to not make any mistakes along my journey and get to a place like Jackie ended up?" A question is just, is there a mistake or some wrong journey took along this journey that you can share?

Jackie Bavaro (07:58):
Yeah, I'm sure I've made lots of mistakes. One of the ones that comes to mind is that in probably my first or second year at Asana, I very much saw the PM's role is a person who wants to say no to everybody. I was like, "All these people want us to do stuff and we would do way too much and we would never get anything important done if we just said yes to them. I need to say no to people." And I got into this defensive mindset and sometimes people would come to me with ideas and I'd be like, "Are you telling me I can't do my job right?" And I would just try to say no to them as efficiently and effectively as possible.

(08:28):
And I did this one day to my boss and he had some idea for design that I thought was a bad idea. And I was just like, "No, we're not going to do that." And he's like, "Jackie, you have to stop shutting me down." And I was like, "I'm about to get fired." I was like, "Oh, I have really, really messed up here." It definitely made an impression on me and I was lucky enough to have a coach at the time. I went to her to talked to her and really started to rethink how I saw the role, this urgency that I felt of "I need to shut people down as fast as possible to the save time," as opposed to take the time to consider that other people probably have good ideas.

(09:03):
And even if their solution, isn't what I think is going to be the absolute best solution, the problem they're talking about is probably real. And I can interpret their solution as a way of sharing the problem and exploring and brainstorming around that.

(09:17):
It wasn't an immediate change, but I remember at one point she challenged me to, "For the next two weeks, say yes to everything." And I was like, "I can't do that. I wouldn't be doing my job." And she's like, "I think you can find a way to do your job and still say yes to people. You can say, 'yes, I agree. That is a real problem. Yes. I think we could test this design with users' and just see what's different with two weeks of saying yes to people instead of no." And I realized that this protectiveness and lockdownness that I had really wasn't something I needed and it wasn't something that was serving me because it meant that I couldn't have real collaboration with the other people around me.

Lenny (09:51):
Wow. I love that story. A little thread I want to pull on there, two questions. How far into your time at Asana did this happen? Because it's surprising how often things like that come up really late in a career and you're like, "Oh, shit. This is a fundamental thing that I imagined isn't maybe as true as I thought in changing course there." Maybe let me ask that question, how far into your career was that?

Jackie Bavaro (10:10):
This was probably pretty early. I'm imagining what room it was in and I'm like, "Okay. I know what that time was." It was definitely the first year, maybe six months in.

Lenny (10:17):
Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. So you have this coach, what impact have you seen from just having a coach? Something that a lot of PMs ask me about is just like, "Should I get a coach? How do I find a coach?" I guess just roughly your experience been with a coach and then any advice for folks thinking about getting a coach.

Jackie Bavaro (10:31):
There's two different models. Some people like to have a coach all the time and that's a person that they can go to and they can explore their ideas and their feelings and how they're just bounce ideas off of all the time, have this person who isn't in any way going to be the person who evaluates them later on. They can be totally honest with them.

(10:48):
For me, I find it's better to have a coach when I have a specific thing I want to work on. I tend to be a little bit results oriented, action oriented, and I don't like to show up and be like, "So, what are we talking about today?" Or make something up. I talked to this coach to deal with this issue of how do I not shut people down and how do I still be a good PM if I'm not saying no to people all the time.

(11:10):
I worked with her for several months, but then once that was gone, then I did start to find that personally I would make things bigger when I had a coach, because I had something that I knew how to solve on my own. And I'd bring it to the coach, and then all of a sudden it felt like it was a big deal rather than a little deal. I've gone in and out of coaching, but I do it when I have a thing that I want to work on.

Lenny (11:27):
Going back to Asana, you were there for eight years about, what kept you there for that long and then how did you know that it was time to move on?

Jackie Bavaro (11:35):
I loved working at Asana. And Asana, I think today is incredibly successful, but it was not always obvious that it was going to be incredibly successful. We had some lulls in there. There was a time when we were updating our entire engineering framework from an old version to a new version. And we had like a literal 50% of our engineers working on this. Set aside half of our engineers to work on new features, and the other half was just working on updating this framework. Which meant that we felt like we were moving at half speed. It felt like we were moving really slowly. Customers hated how slow the app was and this framework changed was needed to change that. But we really were not sure that the company was going to be successful.

(12:14):
Staying with the company through those days, it really was this feeling that I was getting good growth opportunities, even if the company itself didn't succeed. One of the things I think was really important for me in my career at Asana and growing into head of product management is, at one point in my career, my manager, one of the co-founders had a meeting with the two co-founders, the planning committee. The planning committee was the two co-founders, the head of engineering and the head of business. And they would meet.

(12:39):
And after these meetings, he would come back to me, my boss, and he'd tell me "Okay, here's the direction we have. Here's what you're going to need to do." And I had to ask some questions and I'd be like, "Well, what about this? And what about this?" After a little bit of time, I would start to be like, "Hey, you have your planning committee today. Here are the three questions I want you to go in and get answered at that committee. And if they say this, I want you to ask this and this."

(13:01):
And after a little bit of that, I was like, "It might be easier if I just go, I might be able save you some time and some energy if I just joined you." And it was a way that I took myself into this higher level meeting, framing it as something that was going to help out my boss. And it did. It wasn't dishonest, but it was a pretty effective way of advocating to get into this meeting.

(13:19):
I think once I was in the planning committee, I just got a real front row seat to understand how a company is built and what kind of decisions are happening, and what goes on beyond the realm, the narrow perspective of building features. Going from features to strategy, but also understanding business strategy and how do the product choices we make impact our financial plans, and whether or not marketing has to hire people, and whether or not that means we need to open our office.

(13:49):
I really felt like I was getting a lot of personal growth and I was getting an opportunity to learn things that I wouldn't have that opportunity anywhere else. Because of my background and my deep knowledge of this product, that I was able to be exposed to this and have these responsibilities.

(14:06):
For me, I really felt like I was learning and I was growing and I didn't know it all yet. That's really kept me there for a long time. And then I'd say, getting closer to the end of that time, I'd become a manager, I had teams, I've become a manager of managers and I was definitely starting to get burned out. It's really, really tough being a manager. One of the ways that I'd always worked as a product manager is a lot of transparency and authenticity. A lot of explaining to people what our goals are and then showing like "This is the solution I think will hit in our goals, but I'm open to other solutions."

(14:38):
As a manager, there are times when my goal is backfill for someone I know is quitting in a few weeks, but I can't tell anyone about it. Or there are all these personal secrets that you have to keep for people as a manager. And there are times where, what the person on IT wants is a promotion to make more money, and haven't necessarily earned it yet. And it's not necessarily the right thing to do from a company perspective.

(15:01):
Those places where you're torn between these two goals or what I want, isn't always perfectly aligned with what's best for the people that report to me, that weighed a lot on me. That was very heavy.

(15:12):
I was like, "Okay, maybe I could use a break." But for a while I felt like, "Okay, but I don't want to just leave the company and things be in bad shape." So we worked on hiring lots of really, really stellar people, just really talented people and growing people in their roles. And got to a point where I was like, "Everybody's doing great. They don't need me. They can do fine without me." And I thought about, I just felt this surge of energy thinking, "Yeah. If I left that, I'd be excited for what's next," and then started to have this idea of writing the book on careers. That's how I knew it was time to leave.

Lenny (15:44):
It was also eight years, so it makes a lot of sense that eventually it gets tiring. And then I love the glimpse you shared into the downsides of being a leader in product. Is there anything more you can add there? Just like, people want to be the head of everything and then they get there and they're like, "Shit. This isn't what I wanted to be doing."

Jackie Bavaro (16:01):
Definitely. Tooth directions I would say. One is just that being a manager is not as much fun as being an IC. It's a lonely job. When your team goes out for drinks, they treat you differently when you're the manager than when you're one of the other ICs. It's more painful and less fun. For all these reasons, you might not want to be a manager. At the same time, I'm like, "Well, what could I have told younger Jackie, to be like, maybe you don't want to be a manager," and there's nothing. There's nothing you could have told me that would've convinced me not to be a manager. I might say that if you want to try it, consider it a two way door, consider a time that you can try for a while, and if you don't like it, a lot of people are now playing with going back to IC. And also to understand the career paths.

(16:44):
When I started as a product manager, I had no idea what salaries people made, none at all. And I knew I wanted to be able to support a family and stuff when I grew up. So I assumed that I needed to make it to junior VP level to be able to do that. And I just had no idea what salaries were like. Since then, I've looked at levels.fyi, is one of my favorite sites. They'll show you salaries at different levels at different companies.

(17:06):
And if you make it to senior PM, which is one of the middle levels, this middle senior PM level at most of these big companies, you're making as much as a doctor makes, you're making as much as a lawyer makes, you're making a lot of money. You don't necessarily need to climb that career ladder forever to make a lot of money.

(17:24):
And especially at a company like Google, there's a few companies that are known for being the highest paying companies, you can make a lot of money. Much more that you can make in a lot of startups, just by being in IC path, just by continuing to do that job. And companies really need people to do that.

(17:38):
I think understanding that there's different ways to grow your impact and grow your career, other than getting promoted to people management. And for me, I think switching companies is one of the really obvious ways, or teams, of there's one kind of impact you're having at your current job, and maybe you could work on a product that affects more people or has a bigger impact on the people that use it, or something that has more of a social impact type work. But just really thinking about different ways to grow your impact so that you don't make a blind choice towards people management because it seems like it's the only way to grow.

Lenny (18:05):
Along those lines, I know a lot of companies in theory have these kind of IC career tracks. And I find that it's really rare that they end up being really successful, and very few people end up going down to them. Is that what you see too? Or, I don't know, is there a way to actually be really successful going down that path?

Jackie Bavaro (18:22):
Yeah. I think that to the extent that you want to be seeing promotions as like, you want your level number to go up, I think that it is pretty rare. I think that there's not that many companies that have principal PMs, and the ones that have a bunch usually have a partner PM role above that, that's the real principal PM at other companies.

(18:38):
And the reason for that is that the reason a company would give you that high of a title is because they have a business need for PM who can have as much impact as a director, but with the team that's small enough that they can PM the whole team. And there's only a few problems out there like that. Platform type teams can fill that role a lot of the time. Partnerships, someone who's working on a partnership between two major companies can often fit that kind of description. But there just aren't that many, it's a lot easier to have a big impact if you're a manager of managers and you can add up the impact of all the people on your teams.

(19:10):
So yes, I agree that there's not that many opportunities to go from senior PM to principal PM to partner PM. I don't think you need to. I think that if you want to pursue the IC path, which I think is a great path, I think thinking of ways to grow beyond the official promotion. A lot of companies, you can make a lot of money without getting that promotion title. If you're working at a small company, if you're working with other companies that isn't the highest paying company, you'll make a lot more money by switching companies than you will by getting promoted at your current company.

(19:37):
And like I was saying before, the thinking about the kind of impact your work has, do you want to work on something that's more cutting edge? Do you want to work on something that your product that your friends use? Do you want to work on something that's going to save the environment? All of these things I think are ways to grow. There are a career path that is just not climbing the career ladder.

(20:36):
That's a really important insight that you can keep growing, one as a human and maybe even be happier going down one of these other paths, non-manager path. And maybe you don't get the promotions, but maybe you make just as much money as you go the other path. In theory, it's a lot more interesting.

(20:50):
And then the other point that you made is really great, that if you want to go down that route, it's probably going to be an infrastructure team or a new business unit, unlikely to be a user facing piece, because they probably want to build a large teams there with a lot of layers. Interesting. Great stuff.

(21:04):
Okay. I want to transition to strategy. You've written a lot about strategy. I share your pieces often with folks. Diving into that a little bit, first of all just, can you describe what strategy even is? It's like this term that everyone uses all the time and they're like, "Oh, I'm working on strategy. I'm going to get good at strategy." What is strategy in your mind?

Jackie Bavaro (21:21):
Yeah, when I worked at Google, one of the promotions I went up for, I did not get, and I got the feedback that I needed to be more strategic. I was like, "Okay, great. What does being more strategic mean?" And nobody could tell me. And I was like, "Well, who's more strategic?" And they were like, "Oh, this person used to be really strategic before she became a manager. But now she does just those managery stuff." And I was like, "Okay, I have no role models, no words, nothing to explain what it means to be more strategic." Quick shout-out to my book is, I've got a whole list of what it means to be more strategic. So if you pick that up, you can read through that.

Lenny (21:51):
Can we find that on Amazon? Where do you find that book?

Jackie Bavaro (21:54):
Yes. Just the Cracking the PM Career, that's on Amazon.

Lenny (21:57):
Great.

Jackie Bavaro (21:57):
And it's in the strategy chapter.

Lenny (21:59):
Great.

Jackie Bavaro (22:00):
What I did is I wrote a document on the Local Universal Team, so I called it Local Universal Strategy. And I can't remember what I put in this document. I put it in just random... What my plan was. But once I wrote it down and shared it with people, then I started getting feedback on it. And then I could start to feel my way to what people meant to strategy. Then I get to Asana and I worked really closely with JR, head of product. And I'm starting to get a view of what strategy means, and he's got a robust vision for the product. We talked about this idea that when you're playing guitar, you're left and your right hand know how to work together to play the guitar. Wouldn't it be amazing if at a company, all the teams sort of had that ambient awareness of what other teams were doing together so that you worked seamlessly together?

(22:44):
And Asana was the team brain helping this happen. Imagine a world where you didn't have to have these endless status updates and all this work about work, because the teams knew what each other was doing. And as you kept track of your own task that updated the centralized system, that was always up to date.

(22:59):
We had this vision of what the future could be like. And we had our strategy, which got into this team brain. And what's what a good team brain have? Well, has to always be with you. So we need to have good mobile and good security, needs to know about the different kinds of work that exists. So we need to... Right now, Asana understands this kind of work, we need to add this kind of work.

(23:16):
And it has to help you draw insightful connections with the work that it knows. If we know that you have all these tasks with due dates, we need to be able to let you know that maybe you have too many due dates on next Friday. I started to build up this idea of strategy and I was like, "Okay, I think I've got what strategy is." And a few years later we hire Alex Hood, our new head of product. And he's like, "Can you create a strategy for the platform team?" And I was like, "Great, here it is. We have it." And he's like, "That's not a strategy." And I was like, "What?"

(23:44):
I was like, "I've been going all these years thinking I knew what strategy was. And now I, again, find out that I don't know it." We had a lot of conversations and figuring out like, "Well what's missing?" And through all of this, I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy. And not everybody's thinking of all three, but if you have all three, you'll have something that counts as a strategy for anyone you talk.

(24:01):
Three parts of strategy are your vision. This is your inspiring picture of what the future looks like. And this is like, "Hey everybody, this is where we want to get to, don't you want to come join me, come build this future with me? Won't this to be exciting?"

(24:14):
And then you've got your strategic framework. This is where you're saying, "Here is the market we're going after. Here's what success looks like. And here are our big bets on what we think it takes to win that market." That's where you get your pillars, and it's your unique way of breaking down the problem to understand who you're going after and what it takes to win them.

(24:34):
And then the third part is the roadmap. This is where you work backwards from your vision. You say "Okay, I think as a company, we can achieve our vision in five years or 10 years or two years or whatever it is." And you say "Working backwards from that, if we're going to be at our vision in five years, what does that mean we're doing in the intermediate years?" I misunderstood roadmap for the longest time. A roadmap in strategy is not a commitment. Instead, it's a way to double check if your plan makes any sense at all and is even anywhere near feasible. Because what happens to every team I see do these roadmaps, you put it together and you realize "We're not going to hit our vision in five years or 10. This is like a 30 year vision, if we keep going at the pace we're going."

(25:14):
It's this wake up call to say, "Oh, okay. If we want to hit this vision in five years, we need to start working on that big thing now. We need to take much bigger swings at the bat. We need to say no to a lot more of this optional work. Maybe we need to hire a team that's twice as big."

(25:31):
It gives you a way to say that probably your strategy did not actually fit into the timeframe that you wanted and that roadmap helps you see like, "Okay, what would it take?" And then that can be a little bit of an organizing factor for people across the company to understand, "Okay, we're having a major launch in two years, then we need to make sure that we're going to have the marketing support we need for that launch. Or we might need to have an entirely different business model in two years. We need to do a fundraising round now." It really helps kind of pull the pieces together.

Lenny (26:00):
Wow, that's so actionable and easy to understand. I've never heard it describe so simply. Along those lines, say someone creates a strategy, what are signs that it's a good strategy versus a meh strategy? Which should they be looking at?

Jackie Bavaro (26:15):
I'm probably going to write something on this soon. In the past month, I'd actually have two totally different people who came to me with the same problem. And they said, "My CEO brought me a strategy and the strategy is increased revenue by 50%, it's a revenue target number. That doesn't seem like a strategy to me. I don't know what to do." Talking to people, I started to get a deeper sense of what the confusion and the mismatch is here.

(26:40):
I think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, "We want to increase revenue by this much" to, "This is the feature we're going to do." And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other of like "Given that this is our big picture of view of what we're doing, what's the next step? And what's the next step? And what's the next step?"

(27:02):
"As product managers, if you're given a numerical target, that is not a complete strategy, but it's your job now as a product manager to take all of the great product work you've been doing. Let's say you've been doing lots of customer research and you're getting really deep into what the customer pains are and what their needs are. It's your job to take the things you've got now in your mind, you've got a list of maybe 20 different things your product team could work on. It's your job to take those things you want to work on and the reasons why you think they're important, and match them up against what that larger financial target was or whatever strategy or vision you're getting from the executives. And basically see "Which of these feature work? Which of this product work that I want to do best matches up with those goals and why?"

(27:45):
And there's probably a few more missing dots in there. You're like, "Well, I think that this is going to make us the most money. But why? I think this will make us the most money because it's helping us get more money from our current users. And we think it's going to be really hard to win new users because we're already pretty saturated in the market."

(28:01):
That's where you start to get into strategy, that level of detail. And then you say, "Okay, given that we think it's more strategic to get more money from our current users, here's one thing we could do. What are other things we could do? And how do those stack up against each other? Or maybe it should be that 50% of our effort is on getting more money from our current users, and 50% is from going into new markets. Well, which new markets do we think are most promising and what would it take to win those new markets?"

(28:24):
I think it's that connecting the dots. And the only way you find out what dots are missing is by talking to people and communicating your strategy and communicating it again and again, and really listening for people's confusion. Because people will try to hide their confusion. They won't get your strategy, there's going to be some assumption that you're making that they are not making. So you have to pay really, really close attention to find those missing assumptions so that you can then explain why this connects to this.

Lenny (28:51):
That's really good advice of just looking for confusion and that points out where your strategy is lacking. How could PMs get better at strategy at doing this than getting better at this activity? Advice for that?

Jackie Bavaro (29:02):
Yeah. Strategy really should be collaborative work. I think that there's some amount to which the PM should go off by themselves and think about what strategy they want and have that in their back pocket, because that way you actually can contribute to the conversation, but real strategy should be very collaborative.

(29:17):
I think the best way to learn and improve your strategy, one of them is going to be working with the other stakeholders and listening to their feedback and understanding what do they agree with or not agree with. Sometimes it's as easy as a conversation. I can't remember the details here, but there was one conversation on pricing models that we were talking about, and we were each going to go around the room and talk about which of the five pricing models did we think was best. And I think I was like, "Number three is most [inaudible 00:29:44] number two."

(29:44):
And then our CEO gets, and he's like, "I think really number four is the only reasonable one for these reasons." And I was just like, "I agree, I've changed a mind. You're right. You just saw it in a way that I hadn't seen."

(29:58):
This accumulation of experiences, I think matter so much for strategy, for data analysis, all of these things where... I'm really, really good at data analysis, but only because I've seen so many experiments that when I see a set of results, I can just instantly remember like four similar experiments and what the conclusion was and what went wrong with it. And so I'll be like, "Oh yes, this metric is up. But if you check this metric, you can see it's down, which means that it might be this conclusion." It's talking to people, listening to them, that builds it up a lot. But that's one half of it, because you can't always just learn something by a bunch of leaders sitting in a room talking to each other.

(30:37):
I think seeing things through to a certain amount of time really does help. And I think sticking with the team for long enough to be able to measure the results of what you did and ideally iterate, like being one doing it for eight years, I got to try something and then try something different and then try something different. And I got to really notice the patterns and test what works and what didn't and form those conclusions. I think that sticking around long enough to see your results and especially try something else different and see those results, I think can make a big difference.

Lenny (31:06):
What I'm hearing is you get better one doing it over and over and over to being in the conversations and learning from people directly. Is there anything else that someone that, I don't know, doesn't have a lot of these experiences yet and in the room for these sorts of things that they could maybe study up on or practice just outside of this to get a little bit stronger in strategy?

Jackie Bavaro (31:27):
Yeah. Definitely there's a lot of cross applying of strategy that I think that really is helpful. One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places. One of the people I interviewed for my book was to Shishir Mehrotra, who's CEO of Coda, and he used to work at YouTube. And while he was at YouTube, he had a very big strategic question that the team had to decide about whether if you search for a video that is not on YouTube, but is somewhere else like Hulu, should you link them out to that?

(32:00):
And the team was having a lot of trouble making any progress on that. But one day he went to a product review for Google shopping, totally different product, shopping versus videos. But they were having a similar issue and they talked about this idea of consistency versus comprehensiveness.

(32:16):
They said "Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time? Like every time you click on a result, it takes you to a Google shopping result or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?" That framing, he was able to take from shopping over to YouTube and ask that same question and the answer didn't have to be the same, but it gave them a new way of looking at the strategy that he was able to use.

(32:40):
I think having that broad view and looking at lots of other products and seeing how they make their choices and how do they frame their decisions, that's a good way to improve strategy.

Lenny (32:49):
That's a really good reminder of eigenquestions as a framework. I think if you Google eingenquestions, you can find it and I'll try to link it to it in this podcast. And Shishir has a lot of great stuff that he's put out there. Good call out.

(33:01):
Let me ask one more quick question on strategy and then I want to move on to career stuff. How long should people, I guess, early PMs maybe, how much time should they spend on strategy development? And then, when does it make sense to start investing in that?

Jackie Bavaro (33:15):
Yeah. I think that for your first six months on a product, probably don't worry about strategy. For your six months really, you should be talking to customers, researching your product stuff. Really starting off by saying, "I'm going to learn the strategy, whatever strategy my company already has, and I'm going to do my research, but I'm going to deliver on that strategy."

(33:33):
But all this time, while you're doing your regular product work, so you're visiting customers and you're analyzing data and all these things, you are probably having ideas pop up in your mind. You're starting to notice trends. You're starting to notice what are the pain points people have and just stay open to that. And after about six months, I think is when you can start to put together a draft of a strategy for your own team.

(33:53):
I think you can take half a day. Just block it off, don't take any meetings, put on your headphones, go to a coffee shop, whatever it is you do to get your alone time. And just work on whichever of those three pillars of strategy, whether it's the vision, the strategic framework or the roadmap. Start with whichever one draws you the most and start writing some stuff down, just start getting your ideas out there.

(34:14):
And this will start to give you that framework, you can then go try to take that time, fill it out more, figure out what questions you have, what would you need to know to decide which of these approaches is better, what are the open questions you have. And then you can have something to start meeting with the rest of your product triad. The engineering lead, the design lead, any other key stakeholders you have on your team, and just start working with them and start to figure out how are we feeling about our strategy.

(34:39):
One thing I love to look for is repeated disagreements, "Are there any times when we're fighting over whether to add this feature? And I so strongly believe we shouldn't and you so strongly believe we should," and it's just ends up feeling like a battle of wills. Anytime you have these disagreements that feel really torny or they feel like a disagreement in values, that's a sign that really have a disagreement in strategy and that it's worth it to write down what your strategic framework is or what your strategic principle is and address the problem at that level, rather than fighting over individual features or individual decisions.

Lenny (35:11):
It's such a good tactical tip of just like, if there's continued disagreement, that's a sign, you either craft a strategy or maybe a principle which are related, but sometimes different, just principles of the product or principles of the team. Great advice. And the point you made about not spending the first six months on strategy, I love that because a lot of PMs come in are like, "Oh, strategy. I'm going to figure everything out. I'm going to tell us how to build this thing. This all sucks. Everything you all have done before." Just that rule of thumb, of not allowing yourself to invest deeply there for six months. Love that idea.

Thank you and thanks for having me. The feeling's mutual. Obviously a big fan of your work and all the things you've done for the community and this podcast, which has been fantastic. So humbled and excited to be here. Yes, I do think that I'm at least maybe partially responsible for at least a lot of consumption of donuts over these years.

Lenny (00:03:18):
Are you tired of people asking you about donuts?

Ken Norton (00:03:21):
I'll never get tired of it. Well, back when we met with people in person, people would bring me donuts, and I never got tired of it, nor did any of the people that I worked with who got to eat those donuts get tired of it. So, no, no, I'll never get tired of donuts.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Someone on Twitter asked what's a digital equivalent of bringing the donuts now that we're in a remote world. Do you have any advice on that?

Ken Norton (00:03:45):
That's a great question. I'm not even sure if the physical equivalent of donuts is donuts. I mean when I came up with that, I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen. So it doesn't always have to be donuts.

(00:04:07):
I did put that question out to some of the readers in my newsletter a while ago, maybe earlier in the pandemic, and got a lot of really interesting ideas. Maybe that was at a place where people had a little bit more patience for happy hours over Zoom and stuff like that. Maybe that patient set is worn out. The idea that I love the most was actual donuts. There was a PM who got DoorDash codes and found the best local donut place for each of the people on the team and basically sent them a code and said, "Click here and order the donuts to come to your house whenever you want them." So maybe at least partially the digital equivalent of donuts might be actual donuts.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Decentralized donuts.

Ken Norton (00:04:42):
Decentralized donuts, on the blockchain.

Lenny (00:04:46):
Oh boy, let's not go there.

Ken Norton (00:04:48):
I don't know what that is.

Lenny (00:04:50):
So I was perusing your career path ahead of this chat. You had this pretty wild career. You were an engineer initially, and then you were CTO at a part of NBC. Then you're a founder. Then you spent 14 years at Google working on products that folks may have heard of, like Google Docs and Google Calendar and Google Maps. You've also done a bunch of writing. Then more recently, you've become a full-time executive coach focusing on product people.

(00:05:17):
I have so many questions I'd love to ask you about your career and learnings along the way, and the writing. But I'd actually like to spend most of our time talking about the coaching and things that you've learned through that experience. And so, I have a couple questions just off the bat. What does an executive coach actually do? What kinds of things are you helping people with? What does a session look like? Then, two, just how did you decide you wanted to be a coach full time after leaving Google?

Ken Norton (00:05:40):
Yeah, that's a great question. I think coaching does mean a lot of different things. I mean it depends on who you talk to. It is a little bit of who you are, your style, your approach. Some people are calling themselves coaches, doing more mentoring, more advice. Other people are maybe more like me, more peer coaching.

(00:06:01):
To me, I see executive coaching as a partnership or creative partnership. It's all about helping my client reach their goals, their potential, whatever that means to them. So an important thing about coaching is the definition of success does belong to the client. I don't have an agenda. I don't have a set of things I'm trying to share, teach, learn. It really is fundamentally up to them, which means every client is completely different. They have different sense of where they want to go. Different barriers that might be standing in their way.

(00:06:35):
My coaching practice, I coach the whole person. So there is no restriction on what we might talk on, what we might work on together. It's not limited to product. It's not even limited to work or even leadership. It's wherever they want to go, whatever change, transformation means to them.

(00:06:52):
As coaches, we bring a bunch of tools to the conversation. The most important ones, honestly, are probably listening and curiosity, intuition, open-mindedness, really there to help challenge them to see things in different ways, help them tap into their imagination, figure out when there might be underlying beliefs, help them connect dots that need to be connected, help them disconnect things that feel connected. There's a lot of exploration to it.

(00:07:20):
It's very jazz-like. My love of jazz has been shared before, but there is an improvisation to it. What coaching is really powerful is you may not necessarily know where you're going when you start and you follow wherever there is meaning and change for that individual, wherever is they want to go.

(00:07:38):
The question around what brought me into it was actually interesting. I, honestly working with my own executive coach, started to figure out what it is that mattered to me, what I liked, what my values were, what my purpose was, started to unpack that I love deeply connecting with people and I love helping people change and grow.

(00:08:01):
The moments when I had the opportunity to do that as a manager, as a product leader were the most fulfilling parts of my career. And so, I started to unpack that and figure out what would it look like if that was what I did.

(00:08:15):
The other part of the journey was, for several years at Google, I worked at GV. It's Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm. I had the opportunity to work with founders and product leaders in the portfolio. I started to simultaneously recognize the shortcomings of giving advice, because it seemed like, well, I can meet with these folks, I could tell them what I did, I could tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions.

(00:08:41):
You start to realize advice is not as powerful as you might think it is. It's a little bit like cotton candy. Doesn't have a lot of nutrition. You get a nice sugar high. You feel great, both sides feel happy, but then a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed.

(00:08:57):
That's because it doesn't often confront the real problem. It often isn't relevant. Like what worked for us at Google may not have worked anywhere else. It may not even have worked at Google for all I know. I feel like there were years at Google where all we were doing was making things worse by showing up and we should just all have gone sat on a beach somewhere, and the company would've grown even faster. So who knows?

(00:09:20):
I mean so it was these just twin pillars of wanting to figure out where I could do what I like the most, and then also recognizing that where growth comes from is less around advice and telling people what to do and more about helping them figure out their own path, their own way. Then that ultimately you brought me into, hey, I want to do this full time, and that's what I've been doing ever since.

Lenny (00:09:46):
When do you find people come to you to get advice and coaching? What kind of clients do you find you end up working with?

Ken Norton (00:09:53):
That's a great question. Generally speaking, I work with senior product leaders, however you want to define that. Typically, these are chief product officers, VPs of product at startups, largely director level and above at bigger tech companies, some CEOs, other C-level execs in there. I think really anyone that considers themselves in a product leadership role.

(00:10:15):
Often they come to me because there's a career milestone or a crossroads, and it could be that they now find themselves in the position of being a CPO for the first time. Maybe there's a new industry change, or they've gone from a big company to a startup and a have this sense of what got me here isn't going to get me there. That's oftentimes when they reach out for coaching.

(00:10:41):
I think my clients are also very introspective and surrounded by great mentors and advisors and have all sorts of people in their life who can help them, but are realizing that a lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get them to the next level. And so, this transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am. That's often when people come to me.

Lenny (00:11:08):
You said that the way you coach is about the whole person. I'm curious ... I don't know if there's an answer to this, but when people come to get help and coaching, how much of their blocks, I guess, are rooted in their regular life versus skills, technical skills, and more like the PME, product leadership side, if that makes sense?

Ken Norton (00:11:31):
Yeah, I think ... Well, let me maybe try to illustrate this with an example from my life right now. Indulge me, I'm going to go a little bit left field here, but I promise [inaudible 00:11:45].

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's do it.

Ken Norton (00:11:46):
So we are teaching our 16-year-old son how to drive. So he just got his driver's permit. Do you remember when you learned how to drive, Lenny?

Lenny (00:11:56):
I do. Yup.

Ken Norton (00:11:58):
Yeah. Yeah. So it's scary. I don't know if you know how your parents might have felt, but-

Lenny (00:12:04):
Nope, [inaudible 00:12:06].

Ken Norton (00:12:06):
... [inaudible 00:12:06] on the other side of it. It's a whole new journey. Look, he's a smart kid. He's going to do great. But it helped me actually think back to when I learned how to drive. Actually, what I think is maybe a little bit more important here is before you learn to drive. And so, if you think about it as a ... When you're a kid, cars just go places. You get strapped in and you just wait and you get impatient. Then eventually you go somewhere. You're not even consciously aware of the concept of driving. Just cars just happen and you're not even aware of it.

(00:12:41):
As you get a little bit older, you start to become curious. You start to figure out, oh, that wheel has something to do with it. You turn the wheel. Maybe you start to understand there's pedals. But it also just seems really simple. Just like you get in the car and you drive it and you go somewhere. Maybe as you get older, you end up maybe even being a little bit of a smart Alec about how easy it looks and you start talking to your parents about, like, "It doesn't look hard. I can do this."

(00:13:07):
Now suddenly you're behind the wheel of the car. This is what my son is doing. Wow. Is it different than you thought it was going to be? Is it way more complicated? You have to remember check your mirrors. You've got to look before you turn. You didn't even know what that sign meant. You didn't know what those stripes meant. It is just overloading with complication and your internal mindset for confronting this challenge is not going to suit you the way you used to approach the world.

(00:13:44):
Maybe to put it in product leadership, product terms, everyone around you has got some real pithy advice about the things you're forgetting to do. It's like, "Hey, don't forget to check your mirror." Everyone's got a framework. It's like, "Ah, do you know about the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Wait, what's the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Oh, you just put your left hand on the 10:00, your right hand on the 2:00. That's the only thing you're missing. Here's a great medium post about that." Then you're like, "This is a problem is I have not adapted to the complexity of the world around me."

(00:14:19):
And so, there is this sense that what is interesting about driving is the world hasn't gotten any more complex. Driving's always been driving. But now your place in the world has shifted such that the internal meaning-making and self-complexity that is required requires a complete reboot of the internal operating system in order to allow you to thrive there.

(00:14:41):
And so, when you talk about this question of how much of this is skills, how much of this is tactics, how much of this is learning versus how much is internal growth, the answer is it's both, but the shift that is required is very much around how your inner self can make meaning and respond to the demands of the world around you so that you can succeed and thrive in this mindset shift that happens.

(00:15:09):
The skills matter, but by this point, you're beyond the place where you've learned the skills. There's mastering the skills, but there is this sense of what developmental psychologists call self-complexity, the ability to respond and adapt to that.

(00:15:24):
And so, I think we go through a lot of those shifts in our career. The driving example is simple. Actually, probably too simple, because the world is actually getting more complex for those of us that work in product. I mean every day something changes. It forces us to respond and adapt. So there aren't even rules of the road in product.

(00:15:42):
But I think this is what we're talking about, this question of the internal operating system I develop my ability to restructure it such that I can succeed given the demands that have been placed upon me.

Lenny (00:15:57):
What an amazing analogy. Totally hits home in a good and bad way. It's a really good segue to something I wanted to chat about, something that we talked about before the recording, which is what you're finding to be one of the bigger unlocks for your clients. It's also a concept that you've been spending a lot of time refining and you're finding is helping people shift, and specifically shift their leadership mindset. And so, I'd love to just hear you talk through your thinking there.

Ken Norton (00:16:24):
Yeah, it does sort lead into this. Maybe another analogy that might work for your listeners, if you think about product management, your career arc and where you are challenged from a mindset perspective, in some ways it does feel like the early part of your career. You're learning to play a video game. Hopefully there's a tutorial. Your first job is learning the ropes, somebody's teaching you. You maybe have managers that are giving you simple little missions that you can succeed at and if you fail, the consequences aren't bad.

(00:17:03):
It does feel like a little bit ... And I felt this way, and I talked to a lot of people earlier in their career. It does feel like you're trying to learn the rules of the game, trying to figure out the physics. You want to run up the score.

(00:17:15):
You get better at playing the game. You fail, but you start to develop some confidence that when you fail, you'll learn from it. You'll get better. You get really good at the game. You get promoted, you get rewarded, you unlock new levels, teach other people how to play the game. You start to feel really awesome about yourself.

(00:17:32):
But then suddenly you're put in a place where you realize that the rules of the game aren't so black and white. Maybe there's a long delay now between when you get to see what you did and the score of it. Things start to behave in unexpected ways. The physics start to get weird. You're on a level where you're floating. I don't know what the right metaphor is here.

(00:17:52):
But you start to recognize that there's been this huge change. The most frightening part about it is you look around and everyone is looking at you like you're the designer of the game, and you thought you were playing. That's often what it feels like when you move into a leadership role, to come back to this sense of what got me here is not going to get me there.

(00:18:17):
I work with a lot of leaders and sometimes that's come with a pretty significant cost, this juxtaposition, maybe your happiness, your health, your marriage. There's been this existential crisis of I don't know if I love this anymore. Maybe it leads to burnout. Maybe it's not even that dire. It's just a sense of, well, I'm looking around and I need to be something. I need to unlock something else to continue on this path. There is a sense of stuckness that comes from that.

(00:18:45):
What I've come to realize is this is the precipice of, I think, this pretty fundamental concept in leadership. I'm not the originator of this, so this has come up again and again and again. It's not new. It's going to sound familiar. It's like the flood myth from Gilgamesh showing up in all this oral histories of the world. It's not new.

(00:19:10):
Conscious Leadership Group, an organization that I'm big fan of, they call it above the line versus below the line. Brene Brown calls it daring versus armored leadership, sage versus warrior. Even in the world of sports, there's playing to win versus playing not to lose. It's this concept that's come up again and again. Leadership Circle calls it creative versus reactive, and that's the term I'm going to use. I like that.

(00:19:35):
Here's the distinction. Very simple. Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose? Very simple concept. Pretty much everyone understands what I mean. It makes sense.

(00:20:11):
Everyone also then immediately says a couple of different things. "That sounds amazing. I'd rather have that," or, "Here are moments when I've felt that," but that's usually followed up by a couple of questions. "I don't know if that works. It doesn't sound very effective. Is it possible?" Then how do you that?

(00:20:38):
The effective part is actually a question we can answer, which is, yes, it is more effective. Bob Anderson, Bill Adams are two management scientists who've written extensively, done a whole bunch of research, and they have looked at every possible dimension you can imagine of success, both leadership capability, they've looked at revenue, brand, profitability, everything, and it's shown, yes, this creative form of leadership is in every possible way positively correlated with success and reactive leadership is negatively correlated. So, yes, it works yet.

(00:21:17):
Yet, according to their research, some 75% of leaders are primarily operating reactively. So most leaders are operating from a place of fear, reacting, seeing problems, and threats. That's because that other question of how do you do it is such a hard one to answer. It's not an easy thing that you flip the switch of. It goes back to this notion of redesigning that internal operating system, so how you confront the world, what underlying belief systems and assumptions you have that are causing you to operate from that place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
Can I ask you a quick question? Just to clarify the two sides, what's a sign that you're in the reactive side of things? I think one thing you said is you're worrying a lot about how people think about you and make sure that they like you. Is there anything else that's going to tell a listener, "Oh, maybe I'm falling into this trap"?

Ken Norton (00:22:13):
Yeah, you've nailed it, which is that fear, like operating from a place of anxiety. There are different ways, depending on our mindsets, our approaches. I like the word postures because it seems to click different ways that we retreat into this reactive mode. Fear and anxiety is the way. That's how you know. You're just like, "Ugh, I'm below the line." I'm just like I'm seeing problems. I'm seeing threats.

(00:22:43):
Our brains are hardwired to do that, so it's not like that's wrong. These are brains that learn to do that, I don't know, on the tundra being chased by wild animals. So this is our normal way of being. There might be different desires and needs that force you to operate that way. We think there's really three of these postures.

(00:23:11):
Anybody is probably more than one of them, so this is not pathologizing. This isn't putting you in a box. But probably one of these will resonate more than the others. Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you. This was me in my early part of my career.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Same.

Ken Norton (00:23:29):
Yeah. So you're kind of like the heart type. It's sometimes called move toward other people. A lot of that came from my environment. I was coming up with product management. No one necessarily knew what the job even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval. It was this what we call a complying approach.

(00:23:58):
Here, this is why this is so vexing is it actually worked really well. It was pretty effective. Other people liked working with me. I listened to them and I considered everyone's needs and made sure everyone felt heard. But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness.

(00:24:22):
And so, again, these aren't bad. There's usually underlying tendencies that are very good. It just starts to have a cost as you become more senior. It's like the gears start to grind to a halt a little bit.

(00:24:35):
Another way is more of a needing to be right head type, protecting one's own ideas, sometimes called a move away from type, distance, arrogance, criticism, retreating into your own ideas and head. Then the other will not be a surprise, is the more controlling, my way or the highway, autocratic will move against wanting to win, wanting to be number one, wanting to excel, wanting dominance, wanting control, this would be another tendency.

(00:25:10):
Often one of those feels natural to you and another one feels just so incredibly distasteful that you can't imagine possibly operating that way. This goes into the underlying beliefs part. If you had told me early in my career, when you saw me being passive and people-pleasing like that, "You've just got to stop caring what other people think, Ken. You've got to be more pushy."

(00:25:41):
People did say that to me. That was pretty common probably in my performance review. It was very common. Even people who worked for me were like, "You need to push back." My only archetype for doing that was the autocratic, controlling type. I was like, "I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk. That's a fascist. I don't want to be a fascist. I do care about other people."

(00:26:04):
And so, many of our examples and archetypes are these equally ineffective reactive ways of being. And so, no wonder I didn't want to be like that, because that's also not very effective either. But there was a sense for me of redefining ... This is where coaching is powerful is this what are the underlying assumptions and beliefs that you have that are causing you to fall back on some of these fundamental ways of operating and not let go of them?

(00:26:35):
Because the answer for me wasn't stop caring about other people. I wasn't going to do that. That's a value of mine. It's part of who I am. But take the caring about other people, the empathy, the connection, and direct it in a more creative way where you're operating now from a place of purpose and vision and not reacting and protecting and defending and wanting to be.

(00:26:56):
For me, the key to that was letting go of needing to be liked and redefining it as an admiration that takes place over time. So rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, "I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat." That was part of the unlock for me.

(00:27:25):
Again, I care about other people. That's a natural gift that underlines it. But it's a redefinition of how that serves me, if that makes sense.

Lenny (00:27:34):
Say someone's in that first bucket ... And I was definitely in that first bucket. I still want people to like me and I still probably have flaws there. But say you're a PM and you're like, "Oh, man. That's exactly how I am acting right now." It sounds like is the core of it just a mindset shift, going from I need people to like me to what you just talked about of, okay, I'm going to shift to I just want them to respect me over time? Is that the core of it? I know it's probably not that easy, but how should someone behave during that bucket right now?

Ken Norton (00:28:03):
Yeah. It sounds easy, right? This is part of what's hard about this, is it always sounds easy when you describe it, having gone through the journey. It's sort of like talk to somebody on the summit of Mount Everest and they'll be like, "Yeah. Well, I could just climb this mountain. That's how I got here." You're like, "Okay, wait, that's not that easy." Again, it is very individualized.

(00:28:21):
I think there's an appreciation that you have to understand what is holding you back. This is a lot of the work that I'll do with my clients is what is those underlying expectations? What are these underlying beliefs?

(00:28:40):
I Believe that my style was incompatible with being the leader. I would've said I can't be a CEO because I'm not tough enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not commanding enough. I can't command a room. It's like, okay, what is the underlying belief I'm making about what leadership is there? There's an archetype that I have in my mind that is incompatible with this this way.

(00:29:10):
And so, there's a need to confront that. Okay, what makes you believe the only type of leader is the leader that orders people around? Maybe that's all I've ever seen. Maybe I don't believe it's possible to be another type of leader. Maybe there's an inner critic that is convincing me that that's not who I am, because a part of it is redefinition of what does leadership need for you, for you authentically? What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people? That was the question there.

(00:29:47):
It took people challenging my point of view. It took working with a coach, asking me questions, forcing me to see places I'd made connections, that the connections don't really need to be made. There's a lot of instruments and tools we work with in coaching. There's 360-degree assessments that are very helpful here that will start to help you understand, hey, here are places where you're operating actively. Here are places where you're operating really creatively, because, by the way, most people are partially somewhere in that journey. It's a developmental process.

(00:30:17):
And to start to be able to get the feedback, the dopamine hit of seeing when I do it this way, actually it's more effective and it doesn't cost me as much. I'm happier and I'm enjoying it, I'm seeing that it's working, is oftentimes a big part of this because there is this belief that it won't work. The number of times when I'm with a client in coaching and say, "Well, what if you did do that?" and they go, "It just won't work." You realize that there is this wiring in there that needs ... And this is what I talk about, this operating system that needs to be rejiggered to start to make sense of what if it did and how might you know.

Lenny (00:30:55):
The point you just made about how you can realize that you can be successful in a lot of different ways and you don't have to be this one archetype of a leader really resonates with my experience. I actually had an executive coach for a few months, and that was probably the biggest unlock for me. We did the strengths exercise, which a lot of people do. The main thing that she helped me see is you can do all the things that you want to do through the lens of the strengths that you have and not have to force yourself to be good at these other things, because there's many ways to accomplish the same outcomes.

Ken Norton (00:31:29):
That's exactly right. Then once you start to understand that, you start to develop a better way of finding the right place, the right environment, the right role. When we began the conversation, you asked me what brought me into executive coaching. I would feel these ... I would describe it as flying too close to the sun in my career, where I would have a team. I'd be managing a small team. I would love it. I would enjoy it. Then suddenly my team would grow.

(00:31:57):
I'd become more senior than I felt comfortable being. Then I felt like I wasn't getting to do the "real" work anymore. Then I would be just completely disheveled and dissatisfied. Then I'd go try to go find a smaller team or even stop being a manager. It was a very meandering, reactive path. It was like every so often I was catching a wave, and I knew what it felt like to be on the wave, but I didn't know what the characteristics of the wave were.

(00:32:23):
Then through coaching, I was like I love connecting with other people. I like helping people grow. I like helping challenge people. I like helping. Then I was like what are those parts? What if I unpack those? Oh, that's why I loved managing that team of five because I got to do a lot of it. That's why I hated managing a team of 35 because there's no time for it.

(00:32:44):
Then you start to say, okay, well, what if rather than just randomly meandering through my career, I actually elevated needing to connect, wanting to be helpful? Then you're like what would it be like if I wanted the helping professions? It's just a reframing of move through your career in a way that seems externally to fit some definition of success and to start to define that internally.

(00:33:11):
That is the very definition of the reactive versus creative mindset. Reactive, allowing the world to set the expectations and try to meet them versus tap into what your real, true sense of purpose and vision is. Then use that to navigate the world.

Lenny (00:33:28):
It's interesting that so much of this is just mindset. It's not like learning a new skill as a leader or a product manager. It's just seeing yourself in the world differently. All of a sudden you unlock your career. Is that what you find?

Ken Norton (00:33:40):
Absolutely. That's why I think so much of the focus on the skills, the frameworks, it can be limited as you develop these capabilities, because it's inner work. Where we're talking about is this is all me.

(00:33:57):
Now that's empowering. There's empowerment to be able to say I want to change something and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of other people convincing and persuading them, getting into an executive ... This is all me. But it also, in some ways, makes it harder because it is all you. In coaching, it's all about you. It's all about that. Who am I and what matters to me? What underlying belief systems, inner voices are challenging me in ways that I want to be challenged? What is my unique ...

(00:34:31):
I love the word authenticity. It's, like you were just talking about, like what is my authentic way to lead, and then how do I center that rather than trying to fit into someone else's definition of what leadership might be?

(00:34:43):
You may recognize I can't be that authentic way of leader at this place or in this place type of company, but I know how to find it and I'm going to go find it.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Do you have any more examples of either someone uncovering this about themselves, or another mindset shift that you can make in one of these other buckets, similar to the idea of I'll think about people over the long term versus immediately?

Ken Norton (00:35:10):
Yeah. It really does vary. You start to pick up on that shift when it's less of the goals being defined externally and more of the goals being defined internally. So you'll have a conversation with somebody who's new to coaching and you'll say, "What do you want?" They'll be like, "Well, I want to get promoted to VP." "Why?" "Because I want to be a VP." It's like, "Well, what's important about being VP?" "Well, because ... " Eventually the answer is, well, because it's there and that's the thing that I'm supposed to do.

# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast.

And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.
