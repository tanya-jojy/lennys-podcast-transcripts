# Growth tactics from OpenAI and Stripe’s first marketer | Krithika Shankarraman

## Transcript

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:00):
It seems like there's a playbook for everything, there is a framework for everything, but the reality is you have to spend the hours and the time to really understand your customer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):
You were the first marketing hire at OpenAI. I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, "Oh, ChatGPT." It's like, why do you need marketing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:18):
Everyone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, "I don't know what to use it for." The work of marketing ended up becoming creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, "I had no idea ChatGPT can do that." A lot of marketing metrics tend to be vanity metrics about the number of clicks that you got, number of views, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
If your advice is, "Don't just copy what other companies do," what should people be doing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:50):
Put together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today my guest is Krithika Shankarraman. Krithika was the first marketing hire and VP of marketing at OpenAI, the first marketing hire at Stripe where she was the only marketing person for three years. She was also an early marketing leader at Retool and at Dropbox. She also did marketing for Android at Google. Currently, she is executive in residence at Thrive Capital where she supports their portfolio and founders on all things marketing and helps hire early marketing leaders for their startups.

(00:01:21):
In our conversation, we talk through all of the biggest lessons that she has learned about how to market your product from her time at OpenAI, Stripe, Retool, Dropbox and other places, including her four-step diagnostic approach to marketing, her anti-playbook playbook, what B2B companies can learn from consumer marketing, career advice for people looking to get into marketing, and also just what people that don't want to get into marketing should know about marketing to be successful.

(00:01:46):

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform. I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

(00:02:53):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny, and 10 X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.

(00:03:31):
This episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools. No more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers everything from resourcing to voice of customer, to road mapping, to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations. No compromises. Ready to see it in action?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:04:29):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be chatting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):
So you were an early and the first marketing hire at some of the most iconic companies in the world. What I want to do with our chat today is basically go through a lot of these companies that you've worked at and see what lessons we can extract about your time leading marketing at these companies. And I want to start with OpenAI. No big deal. You were the first marketing hire at OpenAI. Things seem to have gone really well over there. I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Does that resonate?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:05:03):
It does. Not that I can take credit for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
Well, we'll talk about that. Either way, nice job. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, "Oh, ChatGPT." It's like, why do you need marketing? It's like the most magical thing in the history of the world. How much value does anything add to making it as successful? Can you just talk about just the value that a marketing person adds to a product like that that's already incredible?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:05:25):
Yeah. When you think about all of the different stages of the funnel, awareness was clearly not the problem that ChatGPT or OpenAI had. Everyone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, "I don't know what to use it for. I don't know what it replaces. Should I be using search for this? Should I be using ChatGPT for this? How can it even help me?" And so the work of marketing ended up becoming, creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, "I had no idea ChatGPT can do that. And yeah, maybe I should be using it for X, Y, Z reason in my own life." And so I think you have to be very diagnostic in terms of what can marketing be doing to help, rather than just going off of the typical top of funnel, and then middle of funnel and conversion-oriented tactics that end up being in a playbook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:14):
So for folks that listen to this podcast, it's a lot of product managers, product builders. A lot of them don't have a lot of experience with marketing. I think it's an important insight there of just, this is a thing marketing can help you with is helping people understand how to use your product, understand use cases, understand examples, things like that. So I think as we go through this, I think this is useful for folks to understand of, here's what you may not be good at and may need marketing help with.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:06:38):
Yeah. When done right, product management and product marketing should be best friends, right? And you are working together at every stage of product development. Rather than thinking of it as a handoff at the end of the conveyor belt when the product's been built, you sort of hand it off to marketing to take it out the door. If you can think of it as sort of a three-legged race from the very beginning of product development, then you go to market with the right thing in the first place. You get these insights from customers, you hear the language that they're using, which can be the sort of cheat code for how to message and position the product in market. And of course, there's a creativity angle on how to differentiate your product in the market, but ideally, you're doing that in lockstep with the product management side.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:18):
The other element of ChatGPT's marketing success, I know that you spent a lot of time on the enterprise side, is just consumerish marketing tactics for enterprisey products. Can you just talk about that? And it feels like that's emerging more and more just like consumer tactics for enterprise products.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:07:35):
In typical organizations that I've been a part of and leading marketing for, the enterprise side of the house, the B2B side of the house usually fits the mold of demand generation where you're creating demand for the sales team and you're bringing new customers and prospects into the fold and into the orbit of the company. That again, was not the problem at OpenAI. When we turned on the contact sales form for ChatGPT Enterprise, which was one of my first launches at the company, our lead volume 40 X-ed overnight. It was unanticipated even beyond our wildest expectations. And so some of the things that I had to do are not typical to marketing at all. I sat down with ChatGPT and I coded up a Python script that ended up functioning as our first lead qualification, lead-scoring model. That was used in production for way too long, longer than I'd care to admit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:25):
It's so funny. I think about when ChatGPT first launched and OpenAI just launched, everyone was just like, "How will you make money? How do you make money with something like this chatbot that's pretty smart, but sort of not that smart?" I remember there's a video of Sam Altman being asked, "How do you make money with something like this?" And I don't know if you just saw this, he just like, "At some point we will ask ChatGPT, how do we make money?"

Krithika Shankarraman (00:08:47):
Yes. And I think the reality is it's not a solved problem. And a lot of folks, a lot of companies in the AI domain are trying to figure out the right pricing model. And it's something that you've talked about in your newsletter and so on, but there is a value creation aspect to using AI that doesn't kind of neatly fit the mold of SaaS-based pricing or seed-based pricing, or even usage-based pricing. So, I think there are still some frontiers to figuring out where is the value, how do different types of organizations and companies and consumers find value? And again, it's not the typical sort of KPIs that you would typically try to optimize and maximize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:27):
I will say, though, in terms of pricing, it feels like ChatGP, it works. It's just like a monthly fee, talk to it up to a certain limit. It's wild to think back now, there was a sense, "We don't have no idea how will this make money." Now it seems so obvious.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:09:41):
Truly was a research preview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):
And I remember Sam Altman just launched, "Here, check out this chat thing that we are trying with," and then the fastest product growth in history. No big deal. I want to come back to this point you made about this playbook, anti-playbook kind of a thinking. You kind of pointed out that with ChatGPT and OpenAI, there was no playbook, and you find that often people following playbooks don't work. Talk about that insight.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:10:08):
In my current role in my career, I've spoken with a lot of founders, and typically, the founders reach out because I've worked at companies that they look up to and they're looking for that playbook. They're looking for, "Hey, just tell me how Stripe did it. Tell me how Retool did it. Tell me how OpenAI did it." And I really hesitate to share any such detail because there was a combination of context, competitive landscape, and the overall sort of zeitgeist of when the company's operating, how the company's operating, that really adds a lot of nuance to what works in the market.

(00:10:43):
And so doing the same things, like if you're just kind of copying the outcomes or the outputs of the strategy and trying to follow in the footsteps of the tactics, you're not paying enough attention to the inputs and, what were the variables and the deciding factors which led to that strategy in the first place? So what I like to do is try to unpack more of a framework for how do you get to become more of a diagnostician to understand the right strategy or tactic in the first place, rather than saying, "How do you copy something that led someone else to success?" Because those criteria may not apply to you at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:17):
So let's follow that thread because everyone's like, "Goddamn, I need a play. Just tell me how to do this." Okay, so there's no playbooks that you... If your advice is, "Don't just copy what other companies do that have done well," what should people be doing? How do they approach figuring out how to market their product and help it grow faster?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:11:35):
Yeah. So I was an engineer before I became a marketer, and so I have brought a little bit of an engineer's framework to the marketing side of the house. And so something that I've tried to do is put together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is diagnosing. So, diagnosing the actual problem. Again, this usually means taking a zoom back when a founder comes and asks, "Hey, we really need to hire a demand gen leader. Who do you know in your network that we should be thinking about?" And I'm like, "Let's talk about your funnel. Do you have a lot of people coming in at the top of the funnel? And when they do come in at the top of the funnel and you start talking to them and having a sales conversation, how likely is it that you close them? How likely is it that you win that deal?"

(00:12:20):
That usually tells you very astutely, do you have product market fit? Once you're already in the room and people are converting, you have found that problem statement that is critical to them that is hurting them the most, and your solution is resonating as a solve to that problem. And so that means yes, probably throwing in more at the top of the funnel is a very good move to make at that time. But on the other hand, if you say, "Yeah. I mean, we get a lot of interest, but once they're in the room, they have a bunch of questions. They're asking about, how do you compare to X competitor and Y competitor? And why does it cost so much?" and et cetera, et cetera.

(00:12:59):
That probably means that there's more to be done in the product market fit zone rather than throwing in more at the top of the funnel because you have a leaky funnel at the bottom. And so hiring a demand generator may be the worst thing that you can do versus thinking about more of a product marketer who's thinking about the competitive differentiation, the positioning, the sales enablement that gets more people through at the bottom. So that's that diagnostic step at the top.

(00:13:24):
Second to me is analyzing your competitors' approaches. So to me, this is not about being super laser focused on your competition because that leads to these local maxima rather than thinking about face shift changes and breakthroughs that you can make as a company. But when you analyze your competitors' approaches, evaluating what others do in the space can kind of give you a useful baseline and identify opportunities and gaps and niches that your company can take in instead.

(00:13:51):
And then, this is the critical step. The next one is you have to intentionally take a different path than what everyone else is doing. And so driving a strategy that sort of sets the company apart is really critically important. I think it's so core to the discipline of marketing, ensuring that differentiation in the market. And you don't have to go into a cave to come up with these ideas and strategies. You can usually go and look at domains that are far outside of your own rather than your direct competitors and come up with some great ideas that you can cross apply and bring in and steal into your own domain or vertical instead.

(00:14:28):
And then the final piece is just experiment, test, validate all of that, and then scale what works and kind of discard what doesn't. So you really have to have a lot of that ability to throw away work when you might have spent a ton of calories on this wonderful piece of content. But if it's not working, don't double down on it. That bias of the sunk cause fallacy really comes into play, especially when you've poured your heart and soul into creating artifacts for marketing. So experiment, test, validate. Give people that psychological safety to fail, especially your teams and organizations. And then, yeah, once you find what works, really double down on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:06):
Let me summarize what you just shared here. So essentially if you think you're like, "I need help with marketing," or, "I have a problem and I think I need to hire a demand gen person or a paid growth person or a SEO person, or I don't know, content writer," something like that, before you do that, first of all, go through these four steps.

(00:15:24):
So step one is diagnose. Spend time understanding what's the specific problem you want to solve, then analyze. This is so interesting, I've never heard it this way. So then it's analyze what your competition is doing so that you can then, one, find inspiration and see where gaps exist. And then it sounds like the core part of it is just make sure you differentiate and choose a different path versus just try to be the better thing or the cheaper thing. And then the final piece is just like, "Okay, here's our path. Let's test run some small scale tests to see if this would work."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:15:54):
Yeah. I'm a marketer through and through now. So I mean you got diagnose, D. Analyze, A. Take a different path, T. And experiment for the E. So it's the DATE framework. I've just kind of coined it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:05):
Oh, beautiful. Okay. We got a new framework hot off the presses. I love it. DATE, okay. So with differentiation, what's your thoughts on saying you're just a lot better or a lot cheaper?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:16:19):
Being cheaper is a race to the bottom, especially when you think about sort of scaling laws and how things are playing out. Every company is sort of becoming an AI company at this time. And so as models get cheaper and more capable, being cheaper is not going to be the thing that really is a durable approach in the market. And I think in terms of doing things differently, it's not just for the sake of it. I think it's really that novelty and that differentiation is something that people are craving for. They're not looking for yet another tool in the market. They are looking for something that aligns with their values, aligns with what their goals are. And so if you can be really crisp on understanding the user need, understanding what is the problem space in which they're operating, I think that one-two punch of a fantastic product experience, and then the marketing experience to match, can be a superpower for your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:11):
Awesome. Okay. So let's go through an example of a company you did this with, and then this may take us to another company you worked at in the stories there.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:17:19):
Yeah. One that comes to mind is definitely Retool. Retool was very different from both my experiences at Stripe and at OpenAI because both Stripe and OpenAI, for better or for worse, were inbound companies, right? There was so much latent demand that we were fighting off people breaking down the door trying to get to our products. With Retool, marketing was between the company and revenue. And we had fantastic product market fit with the enterprise space, with the developer community, but awareness was a challenge. And so how do we go out, not just wait inside of our house waiting for people to knock down the door, but rather step outside of our house and start introducing ourselves to the neighborhood?

(00:17:57):
So, thinking about outbound channels and building demand engines was the name of the game. And here, one of the ways to think about that is, "Hey, should we just scale the paid marketing channels that we already have working for us?" And that's when the diagnostic really came into play, which is, what are the leads that are coming through the funnel? Are they turning into sales-qualified opportunities? What kind of pipeline are they driving? A lot of marketing metrics, again, tend to be vanity metrics. They tend to be about the number of clicks that you got, number of views that a tweet got, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers.

(00:18:35):
Really, what you want to be looking at is your impact on either signups if you're a self-serve product, PLG, or in terms of a B2B company, sales leads and revenue that you're driving, pipeline and opportunity that you're driving. So we diagnosed that and we found that for the most part, our paid social channels were doing not much for us. And so we had to invest in net new engines. So that was the diagnostic. When we looked at some of the competitors, we saw that they were doing a lot of content marketing. They were doing a lot of events programming. And we could've kind of followed in those footsteps, but there was the ability to take a different path.

(00:19:13):
And so what we decided to do was double down on customer marketing and customer storytelling because the thing that differentiated Retool from a lot of the copycat competitors in the market was that we had terrific traction with true enterprises who were paying for the product, who believed in the product, who were expanding within the product. And so having them tell the stories on our behalf was so much more compelling, and no other company could replicate the kind of customers that Retool had in its bench. So, we wanted to make sure that we were using those logos, we were using those companies to the best impact possible, and then we experimented. We tried to put together webinars, different types of sales dinners, different types of event formats to see what actually worked best for us, and scaled the ones that worked and discarded the ones that didn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):
Okay, there's so much here. So in the diagnose step, I think in kind of a between-the-lines piece of advice here is look at what's already working. So you looked at, okay, maybe paid growth, maybe this, maybe that. And then it's like, "Okay, what seems to be working is people find us through maybe another logo, another customer that's fancy, and they're like, 'Oh, Netflix is using Retool. Oh, maybe I should check it out.'" So I think that's a really important lesson there is don't try to like, "Hey, we need to start expanding our top of funnel to all these different channels." There's one more-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:20:32):
And really litigate some of those channels, too, because on the surface they might be working, but are they actually driving pipeline and revenue?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):
Got it. So they may be showing vanity metrics. Numbers are nice at the top, but they're not sales qualified potential. They don't actually stick around. Okay. And then, the analyze competition is really interesting. So again, it's just like, "What are they doing? What can we be doing differently?" Does it ever make sense just to do what they're doing but do it better, or is that rarely a successful path?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:20:58):
You still have to do something a little bit different. I recall a very specific example at Stripe where our product, Stripe Connect, which was made for marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb, where not only are you accepting money as a platform, you're also paying out people on the seller side of the marketplace. The competition truly was to become a payment facilitator. So rather than using another off-the-shelf service, instead of using Stripe Connect, you might go off and become a PayFac yourself. And a lot of the services, organizations, the consulting groups that were helping companies become PayFacs, the things that they were doing was really leaning into that old school terminology, the jargon of the legacy systems and so on and so forth.

(00:21:43):
And Stripe kind of figured out, "Hey, we need to rank higher for the SEO terms that people are searching for. So how do we help rank for PayFac without actually talking about ourselves as a PayFac solution?" So we decided to kind of do a reverse RFP system where we created a piece of content that said, "Hey, if you want to be a payment facilitator, here's the secret playbook. Here's all the things that you have to do. And by the way, if this feels onerous or annoying, it is, and you should use Stripe Connect instead." So there was still a little bit of a zigging where others were zagging. Yeah, but I think if we had done the same thing in terms of becoming a consulting service to become a payment facilitator, Connect would be nowhere near the sort of run rate or revenue that it drives for the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):
Okay. And this is a great segue to Stripe, which, another company you were the very first marketing hire at. You were also, I believe, the only marketing person for three years at Stripe.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:22:38):
I do not recommend that to anybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:41):
There's a lesson there. Okay, so let's talk about Stripe. What are some of the biggest things you learned marketing at Stripe that you think might be helpful to other marketing people and founders?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:22:51):
Oh, man, there are so many things to choose from because I was Stripe for almost eight and a half years. Joining as the company's first marketing hire, building that marketing function from the ground up, it really gave me the privilege of working very closely with our founders, John and Patrick. I would say actually I was not the first marketer at Stripe, John and Patrick were the first marketers at Stripe because they were developers themselves. They truly understood the developer community. And when that audience for Stripe was squarely developers to begin with, they knew exactly how to authentically reach that audience.

(00:23:24):
And so I had to unlearn a lot of the things that I had learned at Google and Dropbox coming into Stripe in order to reach developers authentically. The experience really taught me the importance of deep product understanding as well. You couldn't really play act at understanding the product, especially when developers are trained to spot bugs, right? So not only do they spot those bugs in code, they spot those bugs in marketing and in blog posts.

(00:23:51):
And so if the marketing pieces are your first impression of the product, they're an extension of the product itself, you have to hold yourself to a very high bar in terms of how you communicate about the product. And so we did a lot of investment in design work, in polish in terms of how the marketing came together. And yeah, the value of creating marketing artifacts that were deeply integrated with the company's mission and the craftsmanship that went into the product was another lesson that I learned very deeply at Stripe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:23):
So kind of along those lines, again, people may look at Stripe and be like, "Okay, it's the best thing ever for payments. Why do we need marketing? It's just like, engineers build it and integrate, it works." What is it that marketing most adds to a product like Stripe?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:24:40):
Across my time at Stripe, marketings are very different purposes. And so I kind of see it in different epochs or chapters of my time at the company. The first chapter when I joined, our head of partnerships at the time, Cristina Cordova, handed me a Hackpad at the time, which is like a notion-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):
I remember Hackpad.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:25:00):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
It turned into Dropbox Paper.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:25:02):
That's right. And so she had kept a Hackpad, a secret Hackpad away from the engineering team, which was all of the features and products that we had shipped but had never communicated to our customers about. And so the launch sort of ended with shipping the feature rather than communicating with the user. So the first chapter at Stripe was really just getting through that backlog and making sure that the ethos at the company changed to say, "Hey, your launch isn't complete if you're just code complete. You have to actually ship it to the customer and make them aware of it." So usage became the north star, engagement became the north star rather than just the binary, has it launched or not?

(00:25:41):
The second chapter at Stripe was really starting to expand what a launch meant, right? So, going from just putting out a blog post for people who were already subscribed to the RSS feed of the company versus thinking through, "Hey, how do we reach out to them through an email, through other channels? How do we really invest in this fanatical community that is getting so excited about the product experience?" So we pulled together developer experience as a function, built out developer relations to really have that community feeling and vibe.

(00:26:13):
And then it was about starting to think through the multi-product ecosystem. So Stripe went from a single-threaded payments processing company to one that had multiple different products and features for the audience and the user base. So then the work of marketing became, how do you help people understand and navigate potentially this multi-product ecosystem and platform to figure out what's the right set of features and solutions that they should be using for their needs?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):
And so this is, again, a good example of marketing can do a lot of different things and depends on the stage, depends on the needs. It almost starts again with diagnose. Where do we have a need for marketing and growth?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:26:53):
And especially in hyper-growth companies, I think you have to run that diagnostic every three months, every six months in order to stay adaptable and flexible because those top level goals do change. At some point, we really have to figure out how to scale our sales function. We have to figure out how to scale internationally. And so being adaptable to that meant constant reprioritization and making sure that you were also hiring people who weren't super deep in particular disciplines, but having a team structure that was T-shaped, people who could be flexible to those needs of the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):
Coming back to your point about how there's no playbooks, is Stripe another example where it's like, this has never been done before, we shouldn't copy what other payments companies have done in the past?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:27:34):
Yeah. If we did, we would still be talking about PCI compliance and payment gateways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:40):
There's so much of what you share that reminds me of Raaz from Wiz, who also, you were an engineer originally, she was a product person. Yeah, I think. I don't know if she was an engineer, but a product person. So it's your-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:27:52):
Her first PM, actually. Yeah, Raaz is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:54):
Okay. And I think there's a few things that are so interesting here. One is you both have non-marketing backgrounds, you went from another function. And I think, you tell me, it gives you a whole new perspective on marketing, not just the traditional education of marketing. Is there anything there?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:28:09):
One thing it's definitely made me is very skeptical of most marketing channels and strategies and tactics. And so I would be one of the first people to say, "Is that really going to work? What developer is clicking on paid ads? Isn't a better thing that we could be doing for them telling them to install ad block?" So I think that skepticism means that you just have a higher bar for the quality of the content, the substance of the content. You want to make sure that the marketing is as substantive and as crafted as the product experience itself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):
The other really interesting corollary here is she was very big on avoiding the generic acronyms and classic industry norms, I forget what they were, for cloud security. But it's just like, "We're not this thing. We're Wiz. Here's what we do."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:28:53):
They are definitely a company that zags when others zig. I still have my Wiz socks, which have these beautiful 8-bit characters on them. Their branding really stands out in the sea of sameness in SaaS conferences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):
Okay. There's something I heard that you did at Stripe that I wanted to ask you about that worked really well. When you came into Stripe, you looked at all of the biggest customer support issues and you turned those into docs to help people serve themselves. Can you just talk about that insight and the power of doing something like that?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:29:22):
Yeah, and this was a great practice that existed at Stripe even before I joined, which is all new hires would do a support rotation just to build empathy with our customers. So, users first was a very core operating principle for the company, and we spent about 20% of our time collectively talking to customers, talking to users, talking to non-users to understand their needs, their gripes about the product. And that tradition, I think, continues to today. The support rotation specifically was such a fantastic fountain of understanding, "Hey, these are the areas that people are confused about."

(00:29:54):
Again, I kind of mentioned this sort of cheat code of talking to your customers and using the language that they use to describe their problems as a shortcut to fantastic product marketing and messaging, because it really tells you what are their pain points and how can you meet them where they are. You want them nodding their heads along as they're reading your landing pages. And so when I was doing the support rotation, there were thematic things that kept coming up. People were asking, "Hey, do you process subscription payments or recurring payments?" Or, "Can I pay people out with Stripe?" And I was like, "Of course you could, but there's no reason you should know that because we don't tell you anywhere."

(00:30:30):
And so that ended up being a stacked rank backlog of landing pages that we produce that just educated people. And this is really important when you have strong top of funnel demand, and potentially not as many people and you're not trying to scale your teams linearly. Having those educational resources, especially for developers, a fantastic marketing funnel sometimes doesn't look like talking to sales. It often never looks like talking to sales. It looks like a self-directed educational experience. Even the sales process ends up being very consultative typically with very technical folks on the other side. So yeah, that was a great way and a great program to figure out what content we should focus and prioritize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:12):
These are really cool just little ways as a new marketing person. You can add value really quickly is kind of what I'm taking away.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:31:21):
Talking to customers is at the top of the list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:24):
Today's episode is brought to you by LinkedIn Ads. One of the hardest and also most important parts of B2B marketing is reaching the right people. I'm constantly getting ads for products that I will never buy, and I almost feel sorry for the money that these companies are spending pitching me on their spend management software or some kind of cybersecurity solution that my one man business just does not need. When you're ready to reach the right professionals, use LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn has grown to a network of over 1 billion professionals, including 130 million decision makers, and that's where it stands apart from other ad platforms. You can target your ad buyers by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, even company revenue.

(00:32:08):
All the professionals that you need to reach in one place. Stop wasting budget on the wrong audience and start targeting the right professionals only on LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn will even give you $100 credit on your next campaign so that you can try it for yourself. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. Only on LinkedIn Ads.

(00:32:32):
There's something else that I know that you're a big advocate of which is internal reviews and just making sure everyone's aligned, which I think a lot of people and especially startups try to avoid. Like, "Let's just move fast. We don't need to have all these meetings where people review stuff," but I know you're a big advocate of that. Talk about why that's so important.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:32:48):
Yeah, this is a hill that I would die on, which is that good process or sufficient process is actually something that speeds up a company rather than slow it down. It stems from this idea that we talked about a little bit, which is that marketing is an extension of your product. It's the first touchpoint your customers have with your product. And ideally, you're setting expectations there in terms of what they should expect once they sign up for the product or commit to a contract and start using it within their companies. And when I think about that, consistency is really, really important.

(00:33:20):
The other part, the other facet of why process is important is because especially as you're in hyper-growth companies, scaling teams is part and parcel like what you're trying to do. And when you bring in someone new, you want them to be just as self-sufficient as somebody who's been at the company for two years. So in your second week, can you be as successful as someone who's been at the company for two years? And the reason that I have that principle in mind is because it makes you kind of break out of your shell of, "I've been at this company for some time now. I understand the sort of unspoken rules of the organization. I've built up enough social capital that I can withdraw from to get something done. And I know which conference room to stand outside of to get the founder to review a piece of content before it goes out the door."

(00:34:09):
That is not scalable, that is not sustainable. And so if you want somebody to be successful and contributing member of the organization very, very quickly, setting up some of these processes with the intention of trying to help them navigate how to go from idea to execution can be very empowering and powerful. Nobody wants to do the wrong thing. They want the guardrails to understand what great looks like at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):
Can you speak more about what this looks like? Say a startup wants to start implementing something like this.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:34:38):
Two simple processes that you could put into place today is, one, set up a forum called Marketing Review. This can be a live meeting that you host for an hour a week or it can be a Slack channel where people are posting things async, or even an email alias where things get sent to. Have that be transparent to the rest of the organization so anyone in the marketing team, anyone in the product organization can join that forum. What that does is it creates a fishbowl where you see sort of, what are the themes that come out when somebody reviews a piece of content? Are they looking at the strategy? Are they looking at the audience? Are they looking at the words? Are they looking at the sort of design approach? So you learn through osmosis of looking at some of these discussions.

(00:35:20):
And then I would say don't overdo it. I would say there are probably two checkpoints in a program that are really important to get aligned at. One is the 20% review. A 20% review is a strategy review. What are we trying to accomplish? Who are we trying to do it for, and what is the rough approach that we're going to take? If everyone feels comfortable with that, you come back at the 80% mark where you've done a lot of the work on the artifacts, the different types of teams that have to be involved and how do you take something to market it in the first place.

(00:35:49):
And the reason that I say 80% is sort of critical because if you come in at the 99% mark and you're just looking for a rubber stamp of approval, and you don't really have the slack in the system to be able to make any changes, then that review was worthless. So come in at the 80% mark where you can still make some substantive changes before it goes out the door. And that serves the purpose of consistency so that your brand is showing up in a consistent way to the audience. And two, it helps the rest of the organization learn from each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):
There's almost this unspoken element of what you're describing that I want to dig into a little bit, which is the need and value of having consistent and high quality marketing, communication. Why is that important? There's always this talk of just move fast break things. "We're going to be scrappy. We're not going to be obsessed with perfect quality of our, I don't know, websites and emails." Just, why is that important? Why do you value that? Why should companies maybe value that more?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:36:45):
It's funny because with the companies who value velocity actually do value their brand just as much, but oftentimes they think of these as two siloed separate initiatives that they have to put their headspace and calories towards. And I actually think they are not mutually exclusive. They are actually very interconnected. And so when you understand the consistency of your brand, it actually empowers the organization to move faster because you kind of understand how you want the brand to show up in the world. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?

(00:37:25):
And the brand is not just marketing artifacts, it is your product experience. It is how your customer support team talks to them, how they resolve tickets. Are you getting passed between a bunch of different teams or is someone just resolving your ticket right away? It's the experience that they have for candidates when they come to recruit your company. So all of these variety of touch points that touch so many different organizations and teams within your organization, they are the amalgamation that makes up your brand. And so if you think of these two things as separate silos, you are optimizing for entirely the wrong thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):
I've very viscerally learned the power of brand doing my newsletter. I so fear doing something very wrong in my newsletter. It's like, saying something that's completely off or having something broken, or sending an email by accident to everyone that's not ready. I just feel like once I break that, just there's so much power and trust that people have built for what I share and there's so much power that comes from that trust. If I launch a new podcast, people will assume it will be good if they trust what I do and I maintain high quality. And so it's just like a constant fear I have now of breaking that trust.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:38:40):
Yeah, I mean whether it's fear that drives you is questionable because I think it's also a commitment to your craft.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Yeah, yeah.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:38:51):
But I think that's exactly right. A brand is an expectation that you create within your audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:57):
And to what you said, if you have a strong brand that people trust, everything gets easier. You pitch them a new product. Like if Stripes like, "Oh, we have a new billing service."

(00:39:08):
"Oh. Oh, I bet it'll be awesome because it's Stripe." Or if OpenAI launches something. So it just makes life easier if your brand is strong, if there's trust.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:39:17):
Yeah, and you got to take that responsibility seriously because even with something like Stripe, we know that people are going to come try out things that we put out the door. And so we wanted to make sure that that met up to people's expectations. And same thing with OpenAI. When we launched something, even though we were trying to be first to market and that velocity was so important for the company, oftentimes it also came with sometimes putting the brakes on to kind of understand, how can we improve the quality of the experience? How can we make sure that it is safe? So there were different criteria at the two companies, but a similar ethos overall for the brand experience that we wanted people to experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:55):
Let's actually come back to OpenAI. How long were they around before you joined? It was like many, many years, right?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:40:01):
Many, many years. So OpenAI had been around for almost a decade as primarily a research organization. They had launched ChatGPT about a year before I joined. And so that was the first foray into saying, "Hey, our work is not just announcing research breakthroughs, it is about putting products into the market."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:19):
So there's a few questions I want to ask here. When is a time to bring in a Krithika? When is it like, "Okay, we need help here"? Or, "A bunch of smart people doing great work, people have the product, but I think we need a marketing person that knows what they're doing."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:40:33):
I think the first criteria is having tremendous product market fit, which is really important because you're throwing fuel on the fire, and you might be throwing different types of fuel on your particular fire. So one pillar for marketing that you have to think about is product marketing. So, if you have a high velocity engineering organization and product organization that is putting out a lot of different features and your customers aren't able to keep track, maybe the engagement's not so high for some of the newer features versus some of the core features that you had in the past, a product marketer can really help bring a discipline of launch excellence and customer engagement, differentiation in the market. How are you positioning the product?

(00:41:15):
The second pillar for me is demand generation. So if you have much more of a sales driven buyer journey in motion, how are you bringing the demand engines to bear so that your lead generation, your pipeline generation is staying really strong and solid? Or you might want to think about brand, right? You might want to think about community development as a big part of what you're doing as a company. So it really depends, but I think in all of these, you found a spark of product market fit before you're really going for it.

(00:41:43):
The second for me is that you're distinguishing enough between capital and marketing and lowercase and marketing. And there's an important distinction I've learned over the years, which is capital and marketing, the marketing team, the marketing function at the company is responsible for those channels and artifacts and engines that are driving the funnel for the company, but they are not the end all be all of the discipline of marketing.

(00:42:08):
And that's where the lowercase and marketing comes in, which is, what do you stand for as a company? What is the storyline that you're telling as a founder when you're talking to the press, to the larger business community? And then it really is a whole company motion where the product team is thinking about, "How are we going to market? What are we going to market with?" The sales team is figuring out, "What is the right ICP, the right customer profile that decision makers, that we need to be reaching?" And then it is this entire joining of the organizations to make that happen really effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):
Yeah. I think along these lines, there's a reason Brian at Airbnb merged marketing, or product marketing and product management. However much of that actually happened or not, but the intention-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:42:58):
I would be so curious to see a follow-up a few years on on how that's been going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:01):
Yeah. Okay, let's have Brian back to talk about that. That'd be really interesting. I wanted to actually ask, an interesting thing is happening with ChatGPT versus Claude, and it's so interesting. Claude is arguably better at many things at code, at least at this point. Things are always changing. It seems to be a better writer in a lot of ways. People prefer it for writing, but it's just like ChatGPT is just dominating. It's like, that's what people associate with AI now is just ChatGPT. It's just caught mindshare globally. What is it, do you think, that allowed ChatGPT just to be that? Is it just first mover advantage? Is it some kind of other element? Has it been better longer? Something really interesting is going on there.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:43:46):
One of the things that comes to mind is the orientation when it comes to large language models, and AI in general, is that we're just at the very beginning innings of this whole paradigm shift. And so every single week there is a new breakthrough in AI that comes out from some lab or the other. There's this one-upmanship on point changes and eval numbers and so on and so forth. But I think to customers, the users of the product, the things that make it delightful are the same things that make any product delightful. And there's a sense of loyalty that builds up over time when there is a shorter and smaller delta between your expectations and your reality.

(00:44:30):
And where those expectations are exceeded, it is accretive to the brand and your loyalty to the product. And where there is a negative delta, that tends to be something that it really detracts. I guess, long story short, what I'm trying to say is that all of these companies have to think in a much more long-term oriented fashion because it's not about a race of the best chatbot and the best outputs. It's about, how does AI become a positive force for humanity?

(00:44:58):
And so that's going to take a lot of change management and a lot of collaboration between a variety of different organizations rather than just the companies themselves and the product experience itself, because it's going to permeate every aspect of our lives. Our personal lives, our academic lives, our work lives. And so to make that transformation happen, my hope is these companies are not super focused on just their competition and one-upmanship, but rather thinking about the paradigm changes that need to happen for our society at large.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
It does feel like they are taking that responsibility really seriously, but it is a massive responsibility. Before we leave OpenAI, it feels like it may be the most impactful, important company in the world right now just because they seem to be at the furthest edge of where AI is going. And so it's just such an interesting place to study. So let me ask you this. Just as a person working there, what's something people may not know that's a wonderful, positive element of how open AI works that's just like, "Oh, that's super interesting"? And then, what was maybe a challenge of working at OpenAI?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:46:08):
A surprising thing that surprised me at the company was just the warmth and intellectual curiosity of my peers and leaders at the company. And truly, the sort of commitment to the mission of making artificial intelligence that benefits all of humanity was not just lip service. It was something that was embodied day to day. The sort of questioning that happened, the sort of pressure testing that happened, the rigor with which products were developed, go-to market strategies were developed, was bar none.

(00:46:38):
And so that's something that I really admired, and it was a privilege to be a part of that organization. I think challenging, of course, is just being at the eye of the storm, right? The eye of the hurricane. So, all eyes are on OpenAI at all times, and I think that is a good thing because of the ramifications of the product. But it also really raised the stakes in terms of how we operated and with what scrutiny, everything that we did was looked at with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:09):
Do you recommend that sort of experience for people? Because I imagine work-life balance wasn't great. I imagine there was a lot of stress and worry constantly. Who's the right... When in your career is this a sort of gig to take on versus not?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:47:25):
I'm a big believer of what Claire Hughes Johnson, who was COO at Stripe, used to share with us, which is there is a concept of a work-life blend and sort of making sure that you're working at a company that has three components. I think first and foremost is always people. So, are the people that you're surrounding yourself with ones that push your thinking, who are kind, who are genuinely interesting people to spend your hours with? Because you're spending a vast majority of your time with them.

(00:47:54):
The second to me is product, right? Do you go to sleep thinking about the product, waking up, wanting to put it into the hands of more people because you know it is going to be good for them or useful to them? I'm not one of those marketers who can pick up any product and market it. I have to have that conviction behind the product itself.

(00:48:15):
And then third is sort of potential, right? Not just potential for the company to do well, but potential for your discipline to have an impact on the trajectory of the company. And so when you have that kind of potent combination, it can really change your perspective on what's draining, what's energizing. But being very self-aware of what gives you energy is also very helpful to align with the needs of the company, also.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:41):
Let's shift to talking about Thrive, which is where you work now, and talk about what your role is. And what's interesting, I think, about this role is you get to work now with a bunch of different startups instead of go really deep with one. So share what you do there. And then, what are some things you've learned there so far from a perspective for marketing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:48:59):
Yeah, surprisingly, more people know about Thrive these days than used to even just a few years ago. Thrive's a very unique type of investment company. And sometimes, when I made the leap, people used to ask me, "Oh, was this always in your ambition to make the leap into the investment side of the house?" And I can honestly say it wasn't. But I think being at a firm like Thrive really gives you a very different perspective and it strengthens your ability to be a stronger operator, whether that's in marketing or go-to market or strategic finance, or whatever other pillar within the company there is.

(00:49:32):
Yeah, Thrive's mission is to be the most meaningful partner to founders. And so there's a lot of high-concentration, high-conviction investments each year. And Thrive is also unique in that it's a network of builders, and so they are really pulling their investment strategies from having been founders themselves. So my role at the company is to help our entire portfolio with all of their marketing needs, so sometimes it means being interim CMO for some portion of time until they find a great leader to fill that seat. Sometimes it means pressure testing their strategy and making sure that their growth targets are ambitious enough. Sometimes it means looking at a Figma file for a landing page that's going out the next day and making sure the words are as good as they can be.

(00:50:14):
And that variety across a bunch of industries, a bunch of stages of companies, everything from a company that hasn't even been incorporated yet, all the way to Databricks and Stripe and OpenAI when it comes to the types of organizations that we work with. And in the end, the variety of domains can range from consumer to healthcare, to defense, to B2B SaaS, to AI. So it is a variety pack in the best way possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:43):
And so what are some things you've learned so far? Because I imagine this is a very different experience. I don't know, especially things that you've changed your mind on even, working with a bunch of companies, early stage versus, what can I say?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:50:57):
It's a really different method of operating. And so when you're in the leadership role for marketing within a single organization, you have at least a medium term north star in terms of what your teams are trying to drive for the company. And as much context switching as there might be, there is still one company, ideally one product, one buyer journey. That hasn't always been the case, especially with OpenAI and Stripe, but it can span B2C, B2B, B2D.

(00:51:27):
Thrive is very different in that if you want to be a meaningful partner to the founders, you cannot just jump from 30-minute call to 30-minute call to 30-minute call. You have to go deep to understand the context. And if anything, it's really underscored my ethos that you as a marketer, the best thing that you can bring to the table is your adaptability and flexibility. So, to really diagnose and not just try to spot patterns and themes and playbooks for these companies, but rather be very deep in the trenches with them to understand their unique context, their unique concerns, their unique characteristics, and their values and what they want to bring into the world.

(00:52:05):
The reason that they want to work with Thrive is not because we are bringing our past experiences to the table, but rather because they're trying to do something new that has never been done in the world. And so those are engagements that are the most exciting is that you are building and going into uncharted territory alongside these founders.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:26):
I bet they're all like, "Krithika, what is the playbook for growing this B2B SaaS company?" And you're like, "Nope."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:52:30):
And I say, "There is none."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):
Damn. But we got the framework that we talked about. Okay, I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about just career advice for marketing people, whether it's early stage or later stage. You have this concept, the chameleon CMO. Talk about that and why that's important for marketing folks to think about.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:52:48):
Yeah. The conventional wisdom for many CMOs is to be like a T-shaped marketer. And what that means is go deep in one of these pillars that we talked about, product marketing, demand marketing, brand marketing, and that kind of becomes your calling card in the world. If a company needs brand expertise, they go for this kind of flavor of CMO. Or if a company needs to really grow their pipeline or their demand gen or their consumer growth, they go for more of a demand and growth-oriented CMO. And I think this chameleon CMO concept is a bit of a novel one in that, again, I think modern marketing leaders have to be really good at a bunch of different things.

(00:53:30):
They have to be very analytical. They have to be best friends with the data science pod because they need to understand the impact of their marketing. They, of course, have to bring creativity, but it is in service to the buyer journey. It is in service to revenue goals and goals that they share with the sales team or the product team and so on, so marketing operating in a silo is no longer a real possibility. So the ability to diversify your interest, maybe going from T-shaped to comb-shaped is probably the right approach here so that you can go deeper in different domains when it is useful for the company through the diagnostic that you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
That sounds very hard. I love this beneficial of the comb shape. It sounds like I have so much to learn, so many little skills to build.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:54:16):
Before AI can come in handy. Some of the most brand marketers can become very analytical with the support of a tool like ChatGPT. If your eyes glaze over when you look at giant dumps of CSVs, it's nice to have a partner that is nonjudgmental to kind of push your thinking and to help you understand the details of the data behind the brand work that you might be doing, or vice versa. If you're a very creative product marketer, a very analytical growth marketer, you can work with ChatGPT to be more of a brainstorm partner and really push your thinking on the creative side. So I think becoming a non T-shaped marketer is getting a little bit easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:00):
That's such a good point. A good segue to an AI question. Hey, we got to talk about AI. One of your former colleagues, Kevin Garcia, wanted me to ask you something. He suggested I ask you about taste and creativity in AI. So he said that you're one of the best writers that he's ever worked with. You combine technical backgrounds with creative taste. You do pottery, you should. And you're a voracious reader. And he wanted just to poke at what you think about just how taste and creativity and writing change in the era of AI.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:31):
I think it's going to become so much more important. First of all, I will say I am not a ChatGPT hyphen person. I was an em dasher well before it became a ChatGPT thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:41):
Me too. Me too. I hate that. But just for people don't know, people are filtering out em dashes, right? Because they think ChatGPT is the only thing using em dashes?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:49):
Yeah, and I don't know what to do about it because this is such a core part of my identity, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:55):
That's a big statement, the em dash.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:58):
To take a step back though, I think if anything, taste is going to become a distinguishing factor in the age of AI because there's going to be so much drivel that is generated by AI, can be generated by AI, that power is at anyone's fingertips. But truly, the companies that are going to distinguish themselves are the ones that show their craft. That they show their true understanding of the product, the true understanding of their customer, and connect the two in meaningful ways. If they can use AI to augment their efforts to make that happen, that's better than them subsuming their efforts. So to build taste, there's plenty of past episodes that you yourself have recorded that get into building that work. But to me, that is going to be a real differentiator for not only great marketers but great companies to stand out in the field.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):
There's a concept that I love that recently I learned from Guillermo at Vercel. He calls it exposure hours. That's when I asked him how to build taste, and that's kind of a value they have at their company is just increase your exposure hours to great stuff, because that is how you build taste. I love that. It's such a simple actionable thing you can do.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:09):
Yeah.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:10):
And at Thrive, we have this share channel, which is just sharing things that we're seeing out into the world. It's not particularly deal flow news or competitive news or anything like that, but it is things that we have seen that resonated with us for whatever reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):
Along these lines of not over-relying on ChatGPT, AI tools for writing and creativity, it feels like there's going to be a big issue with people just starting early in their career where they just never learn how to do the thing, and they just rely really heavily on ChatGPT and tools like that to write, to email, to communicate well. I guess, do you have any advice for folks that are early career, just how to find that balance of not over-relying but still leveraging these tools?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:53):
I think there's two schools of thought here. One is that sort of the domain, the discipline itself stays static and the way that you approach it changes over time, whether you're going at it in a manual way or an automated way or an AI augmented way. But I think the other school of thought, which I more believe in, is that the discipline itself is changing. And so what it means to market a product, what it means to show up as a fantastic operator is in and itself changing. So if you're not leveraging some of these tools, you will be putting yourself at a disadvantage. But understanding the underlying mechanics, this is why I would still be a very firm believer in STEM education, is that you understand the fundamental concepts. And then you can have a choice and optionality in how you decide to apply those concepts, but the concepts themselves have to be there in the foundations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:46):
Yeah. Easier said than done because there's all these tools now and you're just like, "Hey, I need to write a report for school. I guess I could just, maybe this time I'll just ask ChatGPT to help me with this one."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:58:56):
Yeah, the mindset of learning has to be maybe the one that we have to really imbue as a value. Because being of that growth mindset, if you go to school just to earn the grades or to finish the coursework, it's a very different mindset than if you go to school to learn those concepts and to understand how to apply them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):
That's something that stuck with me from my chat with Toby Lutke from Shopify. We were chatting about just what is the most important things to incubate in your child? And his answer I loved, which is just, "Curiosity."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:59:32):
I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
Yeah, and that's what you're kind of speaking to is just if you're curious about learning, you'll almost avoid some of these things or you'll use these tools in a really interesting way just to learn things more deeply.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:59:43):
And that stays with you into your career, right? Because you can either go into your career trying to get to that next ladder in the promotion rung or you can get there to bring a genuine curiosity to, what makes us different? What makes our customers tick? And how do we find those unique insights that can unlock something that nobody else has?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):
That reminds me. To sort of close out our conversation, I wanted to come back to pricing strategy. I have that in my notes here and I haven't gone back to it. So let's focus on the AI and pricing strategy. Just say someone is trying to figure out pricing for their product and they have some kind of AI product. What are some tips, some piece of advice to think this through? Any general frameworks you use?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:00:25):
Again, there's no playbook. I feel like it's such a non-answer, but I think the real answer is experimentation. And we found this firsthand multiple times at Stripe, but also at Retool. I think there was a very visceral example where we decided to bring our free product into the hands of more users and sort of what was available in the free plan. And then there was another one that we tested out as a pricing function where we decided to do something quite controversial, which is to take the thing that our sales team was gated on, a self-hosted version of Retool, and made that available self-serve to anybody who wanted it. They didn't have to talk to a salesperson. And that kind of blew up the funnel, right? Because the amount of pipeline that the sales team saw had diminished considerably, but it also helped them focus up market, on higher ACV deals.

(01:01:13):
And so that trade-off is really hard to make, so the only way we could do it was through experimentation and piloting to build conviction. So I would say AI is no different in that you kind of have to test the market to see what works. Is it a seed-based model? Is that where people are deriving value? Or is the way that they speak about the value of the product something quite different? Is it hours saved? Is it the amount of things that they could do now that they couldn't do before? And so there might be a metric there to go off of, and I don't think anyone solved it, especially with agents coming into play. How you pay for AI workers is going to be very different. What is that unit of completion for things like code generators? It's going to be a Wild, Wild West before we come up with something that is as internalized now as seed-based pricing or usage-based pricing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
Wild indeed. I want to actually follow this insight you had around Retool. That's really interesting. Yeah, so you opened up self-hosted Retool. What was the insight there, because this might be useful to people, that convinced you to play with that? Seems like a big deal change to how you price and do trials.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:02:30):
There were two guiding principles here. One is, do people actually want to talk to sales before they get a self-hosted thing? It's sort of like the SSO attacks, right? Is that really the thing that you want to gate your value on? So, that was one. And so we saw a lot of demand from smaller customers that still wanted self-hosted for a variety of reasons, because they worked in regulated industries or they worked with very private data and PII. And so it wasn't just something that was, "Hey, if you have 10,000 employees at your company and you're an enterprise, you want self-hosted." It was that for a variety of different reasons, regardless of your company size, you might want self-hosted. So that insight kind of led us to say, "Hey, where is the delineation here? Because the sales team should be talking to larger customers, landing larger deals." And so to align those two was one of the driving principles.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:19):
Awesome. Okay. Two final questions before we get to our very exciting lighting around. I'm going to take you to a couple of recurring segments on this podcast. The first is AI Corner. And with AI Corner, what I try to get to is some way that you have figured out to use an AI tool in your work to do better work or do faster work, to be more efficient. Is there something there that you could share? And if not, that's also totally cool.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:03:46):
Ooh, it is hard to pick because there's not many things I don't use AI for these days, and oftentimes it's a catalyst and an accelerant to the work that I'm already doing. But I think I can actually unlock my ability to talk to dozens of companies across the Thrive portfolio in any given week, and the ability to get deep on their context, their environment, their competitive landscape. We can do that because of the tools and the products that Thrive has invested in from an engineering perspective. So we have internal tools that are driven with AI that give us a lot of insights and access to expertise for these companies so we can show up as more meaningful partners in a day-to-day basis.

(01:04:29):
So I think the ability to mix AI tooling then accelerates work that you're already doing, and then AI-based tools that unlock superpowers that wouldn't otherwise be available to you unless you're going deep into Google Groups archives or talking to people across the organization to pull out things that are inside of their brain. That kind of institutional knowledge being made more accessible by AI is actually more powerful sometimes than the tools themselves. And in fact, even at OpenAI, it's one of the things that we advised most enterprises to invest in first is their own operational efficiency rather than just the AI magic dust they could sprinkle on top of their product experience for their customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Awesome. Okay. Final segment of the podcast we call Fail Corner. And the idea here is we have all these amazing guests, all these super successful people on the podcast, all these stories of epic wins and nothing but success. And I think in reality, that's not the case. And it's important for people to hear that things aren't always up and to the right and always win, win, win. Is there a story from your career you can share where things didn't work out and what you learned from that experience?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:05:44):
And again, this question's hard because there's so many things to choose from as potential examples here. And you're absolutely right, Lenny, in that most careers are not the sort of linear journeys that are reflected on somebody's LinkedIn profile. No, I'll talk about a fantastic success, which is called Stripe Relay, which you probably... Oh, I'm just kidding because nobody remembers it. It was ahead of its market. We launched it back in 2014. It was supposed to be the platform with which e-commerce companies would tap into social commerce. The buy buttons if you remember that. And it launched to a lot of fanfare, but then eventually failed. It didn't produce the sort of revenue or the numbers that we had expected.

(01:06:28):
And the understanding here was that as much as one side of the marketplace, or you might have some conviction that you need to put something into the market for a particular moment in time, the timing of the market really matters. And the timing of multiple parties coming together to make a platform work really matters. And so the learning here was we hadn't gone deep enough into the market dynamics. We hadn't done enough user research. Did people really want this? And if they did, what were their alternatives? What was the stacks that they were operating in? And would they adopt a net new tool versus one that integrated into existing systems directly like their e-commerce inventory management systems and so on? And so for that reason, I think, again, it was ahead of its market and ahead of its time, but a clear flop regardless of the effort that we put into that launch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:22):
This reminds me of when Kevin Weil was on the podcast talking about Libra, which was his cryptocurrency project that Facebook ran, and he's just like, "Okay, that was a terrible time to launch something like that where people trusted Facebook the least in our history." And now may be a good time to try something like that. Basically, a cryptocurrency platform to send money internationally for free. What a dream that would be. Okay. Krithika, is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe something you wanted to remind people of from what we've talked about? Just to leave folks with a final nugget before we get to our very exciting lightning round.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:07:55):
If there's one thing that folks take away, I hope it is that they know that there isn't one clear answer to any of the marketing problems. It seems like there's a playbook for everything, there is a framework for everything, but the reality is the work is hard. You have to spend the hours and the time to really understand your customer, and there is no replacement for that, and there isn't going to be even with the advent of AI. And the other part of it is to deeply understand your product as well. What are you bringing to the table? And not just your product, but your company's values, your unique approach that you're bringing to the table. And really be intentional and thoughtful about that because in the absence of that, nothing is going to be a substitute to bring that combination of ingredients together.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We have five questions for you. Are you ready?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:08:51):
Hit me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:08:57):
On the professional side, one book that I recommend to most people is April Dunford's book on positioning called Obviously Awesome. She does a great job breaking down how to position a product from scratch if you've never had to do that, and she's just so great for her real talk. So, really highly recommend that. And then I love fiction, so I would say one of the best reads in the last couple years has been Madeline Miller's Circe, which is a retelling of a Greek myth. Lyrical prose, beautiful writing, highly recommend.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:32):
Love the combo. April Dunford, we're huge fans of her on the podcast. She's been on twice. I think her book is in my background. We'll link to her episodes.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:09:40):
And mine.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:41):
Oh, wow. Okay. So cool. Yeah, she's the best. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:09:48):
I'm really late to the game, but I'm finally catching up on Severance. So, no spoilers, but I'm about halfway through the first season.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:54):
Wow, okay. It's hard to weigh the spoilers, but yeah, keep going. It's amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:03):
Granola for meeting notes because, all right, I love taking meeting notes as a way to stay engaged in the conversation and to pay a lot of attention, but I also know I'm furiously typing away. And so the ability to augment my notes and bullet points has been a game changer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):
That's two guests in a row that said Granola, and I'll give a plug. You get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. For not just you, but your whole company up to some limit. Check out lennysnewsletter.com and click Bundle, and sign up and get Granola. So cool. I love that.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:36):
Happy to help, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:38):
It's helping Granola, and me, I guess. Yeah, it's great. Okay, thank you. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find useful in work or in life?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:49):
My teams have now gotten tired of me saying this, but I say it all the time, which is the delta between expectations and reality is the function for unhappiness. And so it is much easier to change expectations than it is reality, so I tend to spend a lot of my energy making sure that expectations are set. Not just with customers when it comes to our external marketing, but internally with stakeholders, project partners, and even within the team so that they understand what are some of the trade-offs that we're making, or why we're making certain decisions. So I could not espouse that philosophy enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:25):
I love that this isn't, because I think when people first hear that it's about your own happiness, but I love that it's about other people perceiving how a something did and setting their expectations correctly. Final question. Okay, we've already talked about the em dash, but I want to ask you again. What I'm finding is, so the story here is basically people have discovered ChatGPT's using em dashes a lot, which are these long dashes that you have to use special couple letters on the keyboard to use. I'm a huge... I use these all the time, and people are starting to filter them out on Twitter because they're assuming it's generated by ChatGPT. There's content that has em dashes they assume isn't real. Will you continue using em dashes in spite of all this?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:06):
I have begrudgingly reduced my usage of em dashes-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:10):
Same.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:10):
... but you will not pry them out of my cold dead hands if you tried.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:15):
Oh, man, me too. I don't even know. It's like command, options, dash or something to even put it in there.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:20):
No, it's option, shift, minus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):
Option, shift, minus.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
I have to type it. I can't conceptualize in my head. Yeah, and then there's actual rules for when an em dash is the right thing versus, there's a middle-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:32):
Em dash and the Oxford comma, the two core tenets of my toolbox.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):
Is an Oxford comma where you add the comma at the end or you don't? Is that the-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:36):
You keep the comma at the end. You must.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Okay. I'm all for that, too. It looks so weird without it. But there's also another, like a shorter not em dash. I guess it's called something else, right? There's like-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:48):
The en dash, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
En dash.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:49):
That's for ranges of numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
Okay, okay. I love that you know all this. Okay. Well, with that, Krithika, this has been so fun and so awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe work with you, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:05):
Krithix.com is where you'll find links to all my online presences. And one of my personal missions this year is to meet as many of the up-and-coming marketing talents in the world. So anyone that you know is earlier career, ambitious, but really showing their impact at their organization, please introduce them to me. I would love to chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
And then what's the best way for them to reach out to you? Is it just on your website?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:29):
Yes, please.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Krithika, thank you so much for being here.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:34):
Thank you for having me.

# What sets great teams apart | Lane Shackleton (CPO of Coda)

## Transcript

Lane Shackleton (00:00:00):
Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:55):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:02:41):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Calm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC2, ISO 27,001, GDPR, HIPAA and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders.

(00:04:04):
Lane, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lane Shackleton (00:04:07):
So glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:09):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?

Lane Shackleton (00:04:36):
Yeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.

Lenny (00:05:09):
Okay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:23):
It's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:28):
Amazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:42):
Yeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.

(00:06:48):
So I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.

Lenny (00:07:29):
Damn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?

Lane Shackleton (00:07:37):
One is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, "Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now." Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Yeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.

Lane Shackleton (00:09:11):
Pre kids. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Oh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?

Lane Shackleton (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.

(00:11:11):
And so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.

(00:11:49):
And then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Amazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?

Lane Shackleton (00:13:06):
When we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, "Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great." And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.

Lenny (00:14:11):
You said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?

Lane Shackleton (00:14:19):
We basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.

Lenny (00:15:52):
Super cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.

Lane Shackleton (00:16:08):
That's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.

Lenny (00:16:15):
Okay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:26):
We were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:38):
Maybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.

(00:17:41):
So the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, "Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh." And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.

(00:18:34):
But the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.

(00:19:49):
And to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.

Lenny (00:21:06):
There's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:22):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:22):
And Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:30):
Yep.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Have you read that?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Where it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:34):
Totally.

Lenny (00:21:34):
The other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable."

Lane Shackleton (00:21:48):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:49):
I feel like you just changed art-

Lane Shackleton (00:21:51):
Yeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Oh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:58):
Yeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-

Lenny (00:22:10):
Yeah. What is that lesson?

Lane Shackleton (00:22:11):
The way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:22:55):
I was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, "I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined." And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:41):
Yeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.

Lenny (00:23:45):
Tell me more.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:46):
The prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.

Lenny (00:24:05):
Okay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:21):
Just lane.substack.com.

Lenny (00:24:24):
Sweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:28):
I think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, "Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?" And I'm sitting there like, "Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals." And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-

Lenny (00:25:11):
What's the cathedral story?

Lane Shackleton (00:25:11):
It was quite clarifying.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Yeah. Do share.

Lane Shackleton (00:25:14):
Yeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there." You ask the second person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays." You ask the third person, "What are you doing?" And they say, "Well, we're building a cathedral." And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.

(00:26:22):
So very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.

Lenny (00:27:26):
Such a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Lane Shackleton (00:27:39):
Classic. Classic. It's Antoine.

Lenny (00:27:42):
That is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:06):
Probably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Are there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:53):
I mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.

Lane Shackleton (00:29:23):
It's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.

Lenny (00:29:58):
The other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, "Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie." Or, "They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems." That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.

Lane Shackleton (00:30:30):
Yeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.

Lenny (00:31:18):
The first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:24):
And the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.

Lenny (00:31:29):
Thanks man.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:29):
You've done something very special.

Lenny (00:31:31):
I appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?

Lane Shackleton (00:31:49):
Sure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit, I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:33:04):
That is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Lane Shackleton (00:33:26):
Nice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?

Lenny (00:33:31):
No. Say More.

Lane Shackleton (00:33:33):
It's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.

Lenny (00:34:08):
It's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.

Lane Shackleton (00:34:31):
Yeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.

Lenny (00:36:03):
What are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?

Lane Shackleton (00:36:10):
There are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?

Lenny (00:36:24):
No.

Lane Shackleton (00:36:27):
We've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.

(00:37:41):
And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.

Lenny (00:38:20):
That's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.

Lane Shackleton (00:38:25):
Yeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.

Lenny (00:38:45):
And how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?

Lane Shackleton (00:38:51):
The way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, "Oh man, we got to address all this feedback." Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.

Lenny (00:39:46):
What about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?

Lane Shackleton (00:39:50):
Oh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?

Lenny (00:39:57):
Amazing.

Lane Shackleton (00:39:58):
And making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.

Lenny (00:40:04):
I imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, "Oh, Lane told us to change this thing." I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.

Lane Shackleton (00:40:21):
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:22):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:41:21):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

(00:42:15):
Any other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?

Lane Shackleton (00:42:21):
I guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.

(00:43:25):
So if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, "Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.

(00:44:29):
And so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, "Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.

(00:45:28):
So a salesperson can say, "Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested." And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.

Lenny (00:46:45):
I love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, wow, this is extremely cool," how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?

Lane Shackleton (00:47:15):
Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.

Lenny (00:48:01):
Yeah. I was going to ask.

Lane Shackleton (00:48:02):
The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important." And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, "Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it." Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.

(00:49:03):
And so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, "This is cool. I've never done this before." Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.

Lenny (00:49:48):
Coda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?

Lane Shackleton (00:50:11):
People are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.

(00:51:06):
So I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision."

(00:52:10):
And it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, "I may have some opinions, but keep going." That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, "Just notify us of the decision after." And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, "Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later." So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.

Lenny (00:53:02):
It sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.

Lane Shackleton (00:53:17):
Tag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.

(00:54:11):
And so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, "Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind." And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.

Lenny (00:55:26):
Awesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?

Lane Shackleton (00:55:36):
One of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, "I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.

Lane Shackleton (00:57:09):
Yeah. I remember that.

Lenny (00:57:11):
Okay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:57:24):
Okay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:46):
Yeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, "Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views." And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.

(00:59:04):
And so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, "You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out." Essentially.

(00:59:49):
And I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.

(01:00:49):
And I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.

Lenny (01:01:23):
It makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.

Lane Shackleton (01:01:39):
Yes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.

Lenny (01:01:46):
You mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?

Lane Shackleton (01:02:13):
That was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.

(01:03:08):
So after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.

(01:04:29):
I think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, "Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store." Or, "I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service," or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.

(01:05:21):
And then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Coming back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.

Lane Shackleton (01:06:33):
Let's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.

Lenny (01:06:46):
At Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, "I need to become a PM immediately."

Lane Shackleton (01:06:55):
Totally.

Lenny (01:06:56):
I think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?

Lane Shackleton (01:07:24):
Yeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.

Lenny (01:08:47):
My lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, "Oh Lane, tell us more." And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.

Lane Shackleton (01:09:15):
That's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.

Lenny (01:09:41):
The other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, "Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home." So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.

Lane Shackleton (01:10:30):
I think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.

Lenny (01:10:53):
And one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?

Lane Shackleton (01:11:08):
Yeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.

(01:11:59):
I'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, "Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire." At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, "Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.

Lenny (01:13:15):
So funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:18):
No idea.

Lenny (01:13:19):
Hoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lane Shackleton (01:13:30):
Maybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.

Lenny (01:13:33):
Yeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:37):
Cool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.

(01:14:35):
And the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.

(01:15:31):
They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.

(01:16:30):
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.

(01:17:26):
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?

(01:18:13):
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.

Lenny (01:19:23):
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.

Lane Shackleton (01:19:31):
Great. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:32):
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?

Lane Shackleton (01:19:37):
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.

(01:20:43):
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.

Lenny (01:21:32):
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:46):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:21:47):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:51):
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.

Lenny (01:22:27):
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.

(01:22:43):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Lane Shackleton (01:22:48):
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.

Lenny (01:22:59):
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:01):
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.

Lenny (01:23:03):
Ooh. It's really good.

Lane Shackleton (01:23:05):
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.

Lenny (01:23:11):
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.

(01:23:18):
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:22):
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.

Lenny (01:23:49):
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:10):
Yeah. We-

Lenny (01:24:11):
Don't know if we screwed you.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:13):
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.

Lenny (01:24:20):
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?

Lane Shackleton (01:24:40):
I like that.

Lenny (01:24:42):
So feel free to steal it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:45):
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.

Lenny (01:25:13):
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?

Lane Shackleton (01:25:21):
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.

Lenny (01:25:57):
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.

Lane Shackleton (01:26:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:26:03):
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?

Lane Shackleton (01:26:16):
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:03):
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.

Lenny (01:27:28):
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:43):
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.

Lenny (01:28:24):
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lane Shackleton (01:28:42):
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:29:22):
Awesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.

Lane Shackleton (01:29:25):
Thanks.

Lenny (01:29:26):

# Mastering onboarding | Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth at Airtable)

## Transcript

Laura Modi (00:00:00):
So our head of growth, who... I mean, this girl is just fabulous. She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting, and she pulls up her screen. She goes, "Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish and the customers keep coming." You sit there and your first reaction is "This is great. We're growing." And she's like, "It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out of product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie." She's like, "So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business."
Lenny (00:00:56):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Modi. Laura and I actually worked together at Airbnb for many years where she was director of hospitality, leading all of the work around strengthening the host community and also improving marketplace quality. After leaving Airbnb, she went on to found a company called Bobbie, the only female-founded and mom-led organic infant formula company in the US which basically every mom I know uses.
(00:01:26):
I rarely have CEOs or founders on this podcast, and when I do, it's because I'm confident that product leaders and growth teams and other founders can learn a lot from this person. Laura is a great example of this and I've been incredibly impressed with watching Laura execute and build this company. In our conversation, we talk about how to build and maintain momentum within your organization, how sometimes slowing growth down is the best way to grow long term, why the most innovative ideas often come from people with no experience in the problem space, how to lead through tough times, why manufacturing fake deadlines is so powerful and effective and so much more. Laura is such a great leader and such a great human, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Laura Modi, after a short word from our sponsors.
(00:02:11):

Today's episode is brought to you by Element. I just recently discovered the stuff actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And, unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. Element is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes.
(00:03:42):
Also, dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on Element to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try Element totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.
(00:04:20):
Laura, welcome to the podcast.
Laura Modi (00:04:22):
Hi, I'm so happy to be here. It's a Friday, Lenny, this is amazing.
Lenny (00:04:26):
Oh, my God, already starting strong. I was looking forward to this chat for a few weeks already. I knew that we booked it a couple of weeks ago. Just as context, we worked together at Airbnb for a while and, not something I expected, but you went on to now become a magnate in the baby formula industry, which I'm excited to dig into. And so thank you again for being here.
Laura Modi (00:04:45):
Thank you. This is going to be exciting. Hope you don't mind. I am going to have a little bit of wine as we go through this.
Lenny (00:04:50):
It's highly encouraged. Maybe I need to start drinking more on the show. That might help.
Laura Modi (00:04:54):
Highly approved.
Lenny (00:04:56):
We'll see. We'll see how it ends up. It'll be a good retrospective.
Laura Modi (00:05:00):
Merlot's so good.
Lenny (00:05:00):
So I thought it'd be fun to start with just your time at Airbnb where we got to work together. You spent five and a half years there. Everyone that spends that amount of time at Airbnb, and let me know if you agree, always ends up being in this transformative time in their life and their career. Yeah, okay, you're nodding.
Laura Modi (00:05:15):
I can't imagine a world where I would be without Airbnb.
Lenny (00:05:21):
Yeah, I feel the same way. And so I want to spend a little time on what you learned from that experience and what you took away there. But just to start, can you just share briefly what you worked on while you were at Airbnb?
Laura Modi (00:05:28):
I mean, what didn't we work on? Just, I reflect back and it's one of those experiences where it probably was transformative because you do get an opportunity to work on so many different things. So I remember joining and I was just put in charge of leading and growing parts of customer service, vendor management. I mean, we were scaling the team so fast on that side. It quickly shifted into taking me to Europe where I led our consolidation of our European offices in Dublin. It was so funny. I remember at the time being asked to go do it and thinking, am I being asked purely because I'm just the only Irish person in the company right now? But it was one of the biggest operational changes that we went through there. And then for the last few years I was the director of hospitality leading global host community and host operations.
Lenny (00:06:22):
I think you're underselling that last part. Can you just share a little bit more of what that actually means?
Laura Modi (00:06:26):
Our product really wasn't our technology. It wasn't the technology that we were building, although for a few years we all thought it was. And then it got to a place where we realized Airbnb is nothing without its hosts, nothing. If anything, Airbnb's product was its hosts. So there was a moment, and I can't remember, it was two or three years in, where that narrative was building up more and more and we realized that there was a need to have a central team, which we called Hospitality, dedicated to equipping and recognizing and holding this product of our hosts accountable to their job.
Lenny (00:07:09):
Yeah, I think we could go down that. Maybe let me ask one question there because I think that's really interesting. For a company where the product, as you said, and marketplaces in general, the product you're selling is the supply, in our case Airbnb hosts. Is there something maybe you learned from that experience, I don't know, working at a software, company about how to think about the supply as the product and how that maybe informs, I don't know, what you're building today or just something in general?
Laura Modi (00:07:37):
I think it maybe just starts internally where you have to be able to create a culture first, to all understand that. Because otherwise you're going to be in a position where you're focused on optimizing the technology, efficiency, growth, looking at tools for tools' sake versus tools for users' sake. And I mean, I remember a very pivotal shift when we started realizing that we really needed to understand our hosts far more than we had leading up to that. And I think growth just follows. I mean, we certainly saw that at Airbnb. If we put the hosts first and we thought about building tools for them versus what do we need just to drive more bookings, users begets users, and that's exactly what we saw.
Lenny (00:08:29):
What are some lasting lessons from your time at Airbnb that you bring to what you're working on now?
Laura Modi (00:08:33):
The most obvious kind of cliched one is culture. It is bread and butter to everything you do, from the people you hire to how you build the right mindset to just keeping the energy. I mean, energy at Airbnb was the currency. It was like, unless you didn't have that energy, nothing was happening. And I think about that every day. How do you keep energy going? And my God, they did that for a decade, just keeping it going. I think the other big takeaway is if you can get people excited behind a vision and storytelling, it again kind of carries through that cross-functional work.
(00:09:16):
I now reflect back on just how powerful our storytelling was at Airbnb to get people pumped up. I mean, even for some of the smallest features that we would build, Lenny, they would kick off with the most powerful storytelling. I mean, we were changing lives. And again, it makes you wake up every day going, "Fuck, yeah, I want to work on this." And you're not just going in to fix something, you actually feel like you're having very large impact. And that has to be felt the whole way down the org.
Lenny (00:09:44):
I love that you're already getting into the specifics of what culture actually... how it manifests and how to build a culture. And so I want to maybe ask another question there. You talked about keeping the energy up is a big part of creating the culture. You want to create strong storytelling, either in one of those buckets or another example. What do you do at Bobbie, which we're going to talk about, to build a strong culture? What else do you do to actually do that? Because people hear about building a strong culture and they're like, "What do I do? How do I do that?" So I'd love to hear anything you've actually done there.
Laura Modi (00:10:11):
I think one of the biggest ones I would say is that you need to get to know people personally as much as you do professionally. And that was maybe something I also maybe took a little bit for granted at Airbnb. We had built a culture where people really personally loved each other. They loved working together. Now, fast-forward to today and you're building a company that's completely remote, how do you build a personal relationship?
(00:10:36):
For example, we make sure that we take time to have personal and professional check-ins. And cross-functional people in the org who maybe have no idea someone else as a kid or what they're doing in their lives. Because those personal connections, I mean, again, it's your second family, you're waking up every day to spend time with them. I think those personal connections are some of the biggest.
Lenny (00:10:56):
It's interesting because there's also this movement away from your workmates or your family. Airbnb I think is very... Everyone called themselves AirFam, but that becomes challenging when you have to let people go and there's challenging times. So is your perspective, that's where you find value, to kind of stay close to that?
Laura Modi (00:11:14):
I think you need a hybrid. I do. I think looking at work for transactions' sake, are your colleagues purely as the people who are just there to get the job done with you? That's not inspiring. No. Do I think that there's a balance and maybe some of the things that get introduced in a culture probably don't need to go that far? Yeah. But no matter what, I do believe building personal connections and actually caring about the people you work for is imperative for building a lasting business.
Lenny (00:11:45):
What's the story of going from Airbnb to building a baby formula?
Laura Modi (00:11:48):
Oh, my god. You mean leaving one of the fastest growing companies to start powdered milk? It was so funny. I don't know if I ever shared this with you, Lenny. I remember telling my dad and he was like, "Hold on a second, Laura. I don't understand." He's like, "You're lactose intolerant. Why are you starting a milk company?" He just couldn't fathom why I would, I mean in many ways, leave an established business that had established parental leave benefits, everything that in many ways, as you grow through your career, become more and more what you need and you need the stability.
(00:12:30):
So that shift, I suppose, just socializing it is probably one of the hardest. And it's a big thing to take a risk because you're taking 10 steps backwards in hopes of making major leaps forward. And I think that's just always kind of been a narrative mostly in my career, which is I don't believe there's such a thing as taking a big leap without first taking a major risk, and that was. I mean, it was a very big risk, obviously. But then also, keep in mind, even before I joined Airbnb, I had a good job at Google. And Airbnb at the time, I think, just had one of its most major crises back in 2011.
Lenny (00:13:09):
CJ or EJ?
Laura Modi (00:13:11):
EJ. EJ incident. It was all over the papers. It was a small company. I wasn't really given a title. And I'll never forget as well, exactly the same narrative. My parents going, "Hold on a second. You're leaving Google to go start a B&B." Like, "No, I'm not starting a B&B. I really believe this company's going somewhere." So anyway, the moral of the story is the move into starting my own business, it was a big risk and it was one that I felt so confident on that was needed, it was worth it.
Lenny (00:13:41):
Some people do what you did there, where you take a big risk and kind of maybe stick backwards and it doesn't work out. And in your case it's worked out many times. Is there a thread across the decisions you've made that you think people maybe should look for or you think is important in taking that big risk? Or do you think it was a lot of super luck?
Laura Modi (00:14:02):
Super luck. I mean, I have a folder of businesses and product ideas that, prior to Bobbie, I had dreamt of. And we can always get into that again in the future. Some of them I still dream of doing one day, but a big reason for not taking the risk is because I didn't feel the conviction. So, yes, while I think it's luck, I think I put a lot of intention into researching the marketplace, understanding the business, determining how much of a risk I'm really able to take, even financially. Sitting with my husband and determining how long I may need to be in this position before raising capital and is it possible? It certainly isn't what sometimes it can appear on the surface, which is, "Oh, she had an idea and she left." There's a lot of work that goes into determining is this actually going to be something that's viable?
Lenny (00:14:57):
I like that lesson. It may seem like Laura went to here, to Airbnb and was just like, "Oh, how lucky she picked Airbnb of all the companies." But what you're saying is you spent the time researching, seeing what the company started.
Laura Modi (00:15:09):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:15:10):
Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about Bobbie, just broadly. Can you just talk about what is Bobbie and then what is the scale of Bobbie these days? What stats can you share to give people a sense of how large this has gotten?
Laura Modi (00:15:20):
Bobbie is a powdered milk company. We are an infant formula. And prior to infant formula, the formula-gate of 2022, which everyone is now familiar with. The short of it is that this is an industry that is owned by a duopoly. It's one of the last remaining industries in the CPG space that has seen any disruption or change in probably 40 years. And my desire was to create a formula that parents could feel proud of, an infant formula that felt modern and met where science is today. Because frankly, none of the infant formulas on the market really had caught up to where science has evolved to.
(00:16:00):
Now, obviously, I only experienced this as becoming a mother myself. I knew nothing about this at all. And then I pick up a can of formula and I read the back of the can and there's ingredients in there I would never feed myself. And I think the thing that really hit me, and this was more of the business investor side of me, I just hated the product and I couldn't understand why, as something that is used by so many, 83% of parents, why is it that I'm embarrassed about it? I feel guilty feeding my child this and it's also ugly. It's sitting on my counter every day and this isn't what I want to see.
(00:16:41):
I remember saying to my husband, "I feel like we have failed to breastfeed." And the alternative is that I need to give her a medical solution to survive, which it's milk. I should feel like I'm giving her food. But for whatever reason, society has set this up to make formula feel like you have failed. I mean, that was the impetus. I know you asked me, what is Bobbie? We are a better-for-you infant formula without the guilt.
Lenny (00:17:12):
Ooh, I like that. That was a good summary at the end. How about about the scale of Bobbie? What kind of numbers can you share? Just to give people a sense of how large this has become.
Laura Modi (00:17:20):
Yeah. Oh, my god. I remember launching, it was 100% direct-to-consumer, it was at the top of 2021. And the moment you're about to launch, the first question all investors ask is what do you believe your growth is going to be? First question. It's the same question you get after you're married, when are you going to have a baby? I'm like, "I have no clue what my growth is going to be. I've been on the market for a hot minute." I remember thinking hopefully four million, five million in our first year. So the growth has been fabulous and beyond our wildest dreams in what we had expected.
Lenny (00:17:54):
Amazing. There's a bunch of questions I'm going to ask about how you grew Bobby, but you mentioned the COVID baby shortage crisis. And there's a couple stories I wanted to get into that was one of them. Can you just talk about what you went through in that period? Because I imagine it was both a blessing and a curse. Also, it reminds me, I have a friend who uses Bobbie and she just told me a story about how someone, she couldn't find any Bobbie during COVID, supply chain issues and all that, and an employee of Bobbie came to her house and brought her formula just to make sure she had enough. And obviously that created forever brand loyalty. And we'll talk a little bit about brand, but I'd love to hear about just that period of the journey and what you learned from it.
Laura Modi (00:18:34):
There is nothing like a crisis that gives you more of an appreciation for what opportunity lies ahead. And I would thank my blessings every day that the only way to look at this positively was to be in a position of gratitude that I have an opportunity that most startups would wait a lifetime for. So what happened was I woke up one day and the President of the United States was talking about there being an infant formula shortage. And again, it's just being in the right place at the right time. A topic that never has really been brought up. Unfortunately, one of the large companies, one of the duopolies, had a recall and that recall basically left the nation without product and we were not able to feed babies in the US.
(00:19:29):
Being one of the smallest companies here, we ended up seeing our customer count double the first week that that shortage happened. All of that would seem great, almost like a dream for any startup to be in, that you're going to see your product grow now because they're moving from one customer to another or from one product to another. But here's what happens. Infant formula is one of those products you can't run out of. It's not cool to be out of infant formula. It's not like a piece of furniture and you're at capacity for a certain amount of time.
(00:20:03):
So our Head of Growth who, I mean this girl is just fabulous. She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting. And she pulls up her screen, she goes, "Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish. And the customers keep coming." You sit there and your first reaction is, "I mean, this is great. We're growing." And she's like, "It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out a product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. That's a problem."
(00:20:48):
So in my absorption of everything that's happening, and again, being a company that had only been on the market 14 months, saying to her, "Well, Shireen, what do we do next?" And she's like, "We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie." She's like, "So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business." That's a big decision to make when you're like, "Okay, so I'm going to turn to all of our investors and say we're turning off our site, we're closing down to ensure that we keep enough product."
(00:21:23):
But honestly, in hindsight, it was a no-brainer. We were not going to run out of product on our current subscribers and we had no idea how long the crisis was going to last. So even though we didn't know how long we'd be off, I gave the thumbs up, sally forth, turn it off, and we went into hibernation mode. And in many ways we switched immediately into our customers come first. We now have 70,000 subscribers who are in a place of panic because they hear the news every day that there's formula running out and our job is to give them confidence and clarity that we have the products for them and we're never going to run out. And we did. For six months, six months, we kept our website off and we didn't grow the business last year and we continued to serve our current subscribers and in the end we became the only formula company that was able to reliably serve its current customers and never run out.
Lenny (00:22:21):
That's an amazing story. I haven't heard that before. You threw out this term at some point when we were emailing earlier of slowth, you called it a slowth. Slow growth, I think.
Laura Modi (00:22:32):
Oh, my gosh.
Lenny (00:22:32):
Is that how you think about this?
Laura Modi (00:22:33):
That was part of also how do you change the culture internally? I had 60 people on the team who were all in a position of driving growth and many of them were probably only hired weeks before the shortage with the position of growth, email growth, paid acquisition. And all of a sudden you're telling someone who just left a cushy job to join a startup that we're no longer growing. And in fact, your job now is to completely flip what you thought you were going to do on its head. So we named the entire growth team, the slowth team.
Lenny (00:23:09):
That's awesome.
Laura Modi (00:23:09):
And I mean, they got creative. At some point we were emailing subscribers to nudge them to cancel because we were looking for a way to ensure that we could keep product, and my God, it was a mind-boggling moment.
Lenny (00:23:24):
What else did you learn from that period that has either stuck with you in this time and/or is there something maybe you think you would've done differently if you could go back?
Laura Modi (00:23:34):
Well, I have a personal belief of never looking back and regretting or changing things, but there were definitely some learnings and I would say on the positive end, some of the biggest learnings were just the power of storytelling and bringing the impact of what we were doing back into the company. I'm in a fortunate position as the CEO where, whether I'm speaking to advisors or on panels or engaging the outside world a lot more, I was able to truly feel, I mean, viscerally feel the impact that we were having by doing this.
(00:24:13):
I'll never forget, I was speaking at Davos on this topic and I had a customer. Oh my God, Lenny, this moment. I was standing outside of this events area and this woman comes running up to me and she's bawling, crying, and this is at a global leader's conference and she's crying and she just held my hands. And she's like, "Oh my God, you saved my life over the last year." She's like, "You have no idea the impact that Bobbie played in our lives by making the decision and giving me confidence that you weren't going to run out of product on us."
(00:24:53):
And that emotional connection of just, wow, yes, we may have grown the business faster, we may have gotten product back, but at the end of the day, these 70,000 voices that are out there and the stories that they have and bringing those back to the company, it's undeniable the impact, by making that decision, we've had. And I think the rest of the company feels it, too.
Lenny (00:25:16):
This connects with something we've brought up a couple of times now, which is just brand and brand building. Clearly, it's something that you've spent a lot of energy on and something you've done incredibly well. I think every mom I know knows of Bobbie. By the way, let me just throw this out there. I don't know if I've told you this, but I'm having a kid and we're going to get some Bobbie.
Laura Modi (00:25:34):
What?
Lenny (00:25:36):
Yep.
Laura Modi (00:25:37):
Oh my god, Lenny's going to be a dad. This is so exciting.
Lenny (00:25:42):
Oh man, this is going to be a whole new direction.
Laura Modi (00:25:44):
I've got your milk, if you need it, of course, if Michelle's in a position and she wants it, we're here for you.
Lenny (00:25:50):
Okay, I appreciate that. We're going to get a deal.
Laura Modi (00:25:53):
Oh, my God, I'm so excited for you.
Lenny (00:25:54):
Thank you. Laura, I feel like we need some formula just in case, right? Doesn't that-
Laura Modi (00:25:58):
You do. You do. And the rule is you have to try it, as well.
Lenny (00:26:02):
Oh, okay.
Laura Modi (00:26:03):
Yeah. If baby's going to try it, you need to give it a shot.
Lenny (00:26:06):
Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, I'll get ready for that. I like that rule. I like that rule. Okay. There's so many things to get used to.
Laura Modi (00:26:14):
We'll talk again.
Lenny (00:26:15):
Okay, so going back to my question about brand, basically I just want to understand what have you learned about building a brand and when do you think it is important to invest there?
Laura Modi (00:26:24):
I mean, it all depends on what your product is, but the first thing I've learned about it is you have to build a brand that connects with what your customers are going through, and the experience. I once had someone say to me, "Think about who your customer is and that one customer, the exact person, is going to wake up tomorrow morning and there's going to be three things that are just playing on them in the back of their mind, the things that keep them up at night. And if you are not solving for one of those, then you're going to be finding a way to build a brand and to get in the way of that, get in the way of their mindset, have them remember who you are or what you're about."
(00:27:06):
And it was very clear to us that everything, from who our brand was, what it stood for, the positioning, needed to be something that parents were really finding as a struggle in that first year in feeding. So you see it in our messaging, you see it in our creative. I have no desire to bombard people with something that isn't part of those top three things that they're experiencing. Otherwise, we will have companies out there and brands out there being loud for no reason. And I think that's continued to help us in every time we have to reframe or relaunch something, to keep remembering what do they care about, let's build a brand for them.
Lenny (00:27:48):
I really like that. That is such a good reminder of just, you are not going to convince someone they have a problem unless you're just spending endless money hammering into their head there's a new problem you have. If you connect to something they already know is a problem and just make it clear this is a solution to a problem, life gets a lot easier.
Laura Modi (00:28:06):
That's right.
Lenny (00:28:07):
Although I know that you also have to kind of fight this breastfeeding-is-best kind of thing. So in a sense you also have to convince people this isn't what you think it is.
Laura Modi (00:28:22):
Yeah. And then, what's the saying? If you're explaining, you're losing. And I think there's a part of this where there's going to be a large group of people that are always going to be in the mindset that breast is the only way to do it, and anyone who does otherwise is doing second best. And I'm not there to try and convince them. I think a part of this is amplifying those that are in need of our products, that are the 83% using formula and make sure that they feel heard. But that has been a learning. I mean, that's been a huge brand learning. How do you not lean into or amplify the voices that shouldn't be heard and in many ways just get distracted by it?
Lenny (00:29:03):
That's really interesting, and I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but I know initially the brand strategy was basically breast is not best. Formula is just as good. And what I'm hearing is you kind of realized you're not going to convince people of that and it's more lean into people that already understand.
Laura Modi (00:29:19):
Yeah. And I think another major belief I have is no brand, and I do fundamentally believe this, no brand should ever be in a position of pointing fingers to something that's better or worse. Our only job, and I wish politics would also do this, our only job is to talk about what we do and why we exist and why we believe our product is good. And I would say the flip is the same in formula. If a mother out there has access to another brand of formula that is more accessible, maybe more affordable, and it suits their baby, then good for them. And I should never be a company in a position pointing to a competitor or another way of feeding saying that it's worse off, ever.

(00:31:13):
Something else I heard about the way you operate is you, speaking of brand, is you brand internal things. Can you just talk about what that's all about?
Laura Modi (00:31:21):
Oh, my God. This is, I feel, like a secret sauce of just how to get it done half the time. And I really, really do believe the power of branding the mundane is so successful. I mean, we brand, to be fair, I actually feel like that this was a page out of the Airbnb book. Do you remember going back early days when we were doing customer service deep dives? What were the issues that customers were having? And we branded a program called Air Dives. Do you remember Air Dives?
Lenny (00:31:56):
Yeah.
Laura Modi (00:31:57):
And this program just became this thing where everyone wanted to know on a Friday what was the latest Air Dive. And really what an Air Dive was was an analysis of customer service tickets and customer service pain points. But how much better is Air Dive than a customer service analysis? So much better. So I think a lot of learnings on just the power of branding and storytelling your workflows and your frameworks and what it means to do your job, often keeps people motivated, too. And it creates memory recall a lot better, too. So now when you prefer Slack channels, they're all like, I don't even want to name them because I'm going to give you-
Lenny (00:32:43):
No, I was going to ask. I'd love some examples and I know they're going to sound ridiculous to an outsider, but what are some examples of things? And you can say like Bobbie Blank, or what's your naming convention?
Laura Modi (00:32:52):
Oh, my God. Project Shamrock. I'm not going to tell you what that's about. Project Lumberjack. Ooh, Got B 2022. I can give you so much insight into what these are and I'll give you an example of it. We have legal approvals that need to get made and these legal approvals on content claims have to happen. And I was like, okay, well how do we make sure everyone sticks to the quality SOP that legal wants set for all of the claims we have to have in place? So we created a program called the Secret Shopping Program, and our regulatory legal team go out and they do their own secret shopping once a month and then they report back on any misleading claims or ones that aren't fully understood that Bobbie needs to go back and update. But having a secret shopping meeting is very different to potentially coming in and listening to legal report out in your claims mishaps.
Lenny (00:33:59):
Speaking of legal mishaps and copy nuances, one of my favorite memories of you is I was in San Francisco on Divisadero outside, I think, The Mill, and you were just running by heading somewhere and we started chatting. You were heading, I believe, to the warehouse that you're manufacturing the early versions of Bobbie, and apparently the FDA showed up and shut you down because of some misleading communication in the news, as you're launching. I'd love to hear that story because I love it.
Laura Modi (00:34:26):
By the way, how you just transitioned from one example I just gave to that was absolutely exceptional, speaking of content mishaps.
Lenny (00:34:40):
I appreciate that.
Laura Modi (00:34:42):
This is why you're such a good podcast host, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:44):
You're so kind.
Laura Modi (00:34:44):
You're so good.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Thank you, Laura.
Laura Modi (00:34:46):
Oh, my god, that moment. I do remember bumping into you. I was in an identity crisis. Yeah, early days. I think the one big learning I've had is that when you're in an industry where you are disrupting, I mean truly disrupting the status quo, you're going to be met with some reactions, people, or in our case government agencies who aren't happy about what you're doing. It was early days, we just launched a pilot and the FDA showed up at our warehouse and they didn't like the way that we were labeling the product. We had to pull all of our product from the market, we had to relabel everything and we had to work with the agency for another year before we could bring our products back. For startup world, that was a huge, I wouldn't even say it was a pivot, it was a patient pause, thinking sure that we could get back on track and build intentions with the FDA again.
Lenny (00:35:45):
Another example of slowth, maybe.
Laura Modi (00:35:47):
Another example of slowth, yes.
Lenny (00:35:49):
How did you personally stay motivated and keep morale up within the company during that period?
Laura Modi (00:35:55):
Well, I found out I was pregnant with my third child right after.
Lenny (00:35:59):
Super.
Laura Modi (00:36:01):
There's something about also growing your personal life while professionally it's happening. There's a little bit of give and take as well. So sometimes in moment of professional slowth, you might find that there's personal growth. That's exactly what I found. So I mean, yeah, during this journey I went on from being inspired by my first kid where I wasn't able to breastfeed and then had two more along the journey. And I don't know, I've actually never spoken about this, but I do think there's a beautiful marriage in that personal and professional growth that you can have and you kind of need to find moments where you lean into one and maybe the other. And then there's moments, like I kind of feel like I'm going through right now, where both of them are just on fire and you can't slow them down.
Lenny (00:36:44):
It might be a good time to chat about that. So you have this fast-growing business, you have three kids. Your partner is also a founder, also very busy. How do you manage all of these things?
Laura Modi (00:36:59):
That question is actually probably the most common question I get from new founders, those that are aspiring entrepreneurs, on just like how do you do it all? I mean, a lot of it's your infrastructure, it's your... Actually, hold on a second. I'm going to do something I don't think you've done on a podcast before. Hold on. This is my EA. I'm going to pull this woman in. Everyone just needs to say hi to Kendra. This woman.
Lenny (00:37:25):
Hi, Kendra.
Laura Modi (00:37:28):
I'm introducing her because the power of a support system to be able to do what you do, I mean, you are an extension, my leverage, my everything. And never leave.
Kendra (00:37:42):
I'm not going anywhere.
Laura Modi (00:37:43):
I'd be so screwed. And everyone should not only know the power and leverage of their person, but the level of appreciation and celebration you need to have for them is just huge.
Kendra (00:37:56):
I always feel celebrated, so thank you. I appreciate it.
Lenny (00:37:59):
How do people find a Kendra of their own? That's the million-dollar question.
Laura Modi (00:38:02):
Well, first, you don't take this one. This is a poach-free podcast.
Lenny (00:38:02):
Her name Lauren, not-
Laura Modi (00:38:10):
Yes, that's right.
Kendra (00:38:11):
We should have code names.
Laura Modi (00:38:12):
There's no last names here. How do you find your Kendra? I will say it took multiple interviews and it's all about chemistry. I think it's about chemistry and finding somebody that you genuinely care about. I genuinely care about you, your heart, your kids, your family, and I think finding that connection is really important.
Kendra (00:38:36):
Yeah.
Laura Modi (00:38:37):
Yeah. You know what's also funny, too, I think there's this feeling, and I would hear this from folks, how do you do it all? And I think we also just need to be very transparent. It takes a lot of work to do it all. I, as an operator, am very proud of the infrastructure I have built. I mean, we have calendars on our walls, we have calendars for our kids. We have back and forth birthday planning. It's additional help in the house. My nanny is the other extension in our house.
(00:39:10):
I mean, I don't know what we would do without Clifford. He is everything for us and I also have to see him as an extension to our parenting. But that is, I think, the only way to get through the chaos and the only way to embrace the all, is you actually need to put in the work to build the infrastructure, the systems, the frameworks, and then every month, or sometimes in our case on a weekly basis, me and my husband, we have a meeting every Sunday and it's walking through the agendas. Who's going to what TaeKwonDo classes this week? Or who's trading off on birthday parties or parent-teacher meetings. Because you're right, a dual CEO-founder household and three kids, it will age you fast if you don't have it.
Lenny (00:39:58):
It also makes me think a little bit about what you talked about earlier where, when things slow down a little bit in the business, there's an opportunity to lean into that part of life and then kind of get ahead on some stuff, in theory.
Laura Modi (00:40:09):
Totally, totally.
Lenny (00:40:11):
In terms of the business, I imagine you never started a D2C business before this. Also, you mentioned you've never formulated a baby formula prior to this. Clearly, it's working out. What's a lesson there of just doing something you've never done? Is that something you imagined is a good idea? Maybe looking back, maybe it doesn't matter. What have you learned about just this idea of doing something totally new and different?
Laura Modi (00:40:34):
I think one of the biggest beliefs is that an ounce of naivety will be your biggest secret to success. And I think the word even naivety sometimes gets a bad rap, but naivety is the definition of creativity and innovation and canvas and white space and opportunity. And I definitely went into starting this company with a level of naivety to how regulated it was, to the stigma associated with it, to how hard it would be. But that has allowed me to continue to look at the status quo differently.
(00:41:15):
I don't, because I don't fully understand it, and I have applied those same principles even into how I hire people because I do think... I'm now wondering who's going to watch this on my team, because obviously we have some specialists, but this is generalists who make the world go round. I think sometimes putting the most unlikely people who have an ounce of naivety to what it takes to win and succeed are the ones that are going to drive the biggest impact.
Lenny (00:41:45):
I love that. And it makes me think of a couple of things that I'll just share real quick. One is I was listening to an interview with Mr. Beast who is the number one YouTube creator on TikTok. I think he's got the biggest TikTok, and he talked about how he's got this business he's building, which is like a new way of creating content. And anytime he hires someone from a traditional Hollywood movie-making established kind of background, he's like, "They know what they're doing. They're going to help me legitimize this thing, make it scale." He's like, "Every time, they never work out. They just don't see what we're doing here. They don't understand how this is different and they just slow everything down." And he finds just finding really young, hungry, hardworking people that can learn and understand what he's done end up working a lot better.
Laura Modi (00:42:27):
Always.
Lenny (00:42:28):
The other interesting insight is I'm doing a series right now on B2B businesses and how the biggest B2B companies started and so far I'm finding 70% of the founders had no specific background or skill in the area. They went in to say it's security or sales or something like that. So there's a lot of examples of this.
Laura Modi (00:42:48):
I'll give you one example of someone who's in C who's just an absolute rockstar. Our girl who leads marketing is an Emmy Award news anchor. She's not your traditional marketer. She came in asking me to... She was like, "What does CAC mean? Do we need to look at this LTV number?" And the reason I wanted her in C was because she was the complete antithesis to what we would normally define as a good performance marketer. I wanted someone in C who got media, who got brand and storytelling, and she operates like a news anchor. And in many ways I would look to the team that she's built and think that we maybe have more of a media company than we do a marketing team. And that has been the fuel for the brand that you see today, 100%. And then you hire, unlike the people in those positions and especially senior positions, they're going to do exactly the same throughout the business as well.
Lenny (00:43:53):
That is really interesting. It makes me think of Airbnb a bit. Also, the browser company. We had the founder of that company on here and they have a storytelling team within their company. Their job is tell the story.
Laura Modi (00:44:01):
I love that.
Lenny (00:44:03):
So you talked about how you're hiring people that aren't necessarily deep in a specific skill that you need them to do. What is it that you look for instead that you think is important for them to figure out what they need to be doing?
Laura Modi (00:44:15):
Curiosity. A lot of curiosity and just openness to what's out there. I definitely look for people who have the ability to make decisions and move fast and not get worried about the outcome. That is the biggest learning in a startup. The secret is momentum and just keeping momentum. And if we try and perfect everything, you just miss the boat. And I believe that, what's the common saying, perfect is the enemy of good, or something.
Lenny (00:44:52):
Yeah, I think that's the one.
Laura Modi (00:44:54):
I mean, it really is. So I look for people who just want to do it, just get it done. Again, part of that is just rolling up your sleeves and not questioning your job. When I find in interviews and people are really questioning the lanes they're going to be in and the job they're going to do, or "I don't do that." That's saying, "I don't do that." A huge flag. You do do it. If you're joining this company, if you're within a certain work stream or a certain department and you're behind what the company's working on, in many ways we need people who do do that. So I look for just optimistic doers.
Lenny (00:45:32):
I love that. That's such a cool phrase of how to simplify it, what you want to hire and just optimistic doers. There's so many people that have big ideas and pontificate strategy, and you just need people doing the thing.
Laura Modi (00:45:44):
100%. I call it intellectual ejaculation, which, if that's not allowed of the podcast, [inaudible 00:45:52] totally wiped.
Lenny (00:45:52):
That's allowed. I'll allow it.
Laura Modi (00:45:55):
Thank you.
Lenny (00:45:57):
Okay, so you're talking about momentum. I want to talk about growth. A lot of this podcast is about growth strategy, how companies grow. You're building a D2C company. D2C is really hard. There's been so many attempts. Most fail, most people can't figure out how to do it scalably. So many challenges. What have you learned about growing D2C company? What's worked well for you?
Laura Modi (00:46:17):
This narrative of D2C isn't working, or D2C is over, D2C is dead. It kills me. Because we're being way too reductionist in that message. D2C isn't dead. Just the approach for how people did D2C is a bit dated. We should not be paying for every customer and we should be very careful that people aren't getting hooked on the drug that is paid marketing or performance marketing. And I think that drug, and then obviously as we start to see changes on the way certain performance works, it just becomes more expensive and people are resetting how they do performance marketing. The short of it is D2C is not dead. How you drive people to D2C, how you acquire customers, how you build sustainable businesses, that needs to change.
Lenny (00:47:14):
And what is it that you've done that allows you to do that? I imagine a lot of it is word-of-mouth, which everyone always wants. "How do we do more word-of-mouth?" So what's worked? How do you do that?
Laura Modi (00:47:24):
Well, I mean, the three major pieces of it is that the focus on commerce, content and community.
Lenny (00:47:30):
Commerce, content and community.
Laura Modi (00:47:33):
So commerce, content and community. But most D2C businesses have put commerce at the top of their list. We flipped it. It's now content, community and commerce, and building good content that is really smart SEO, that has the ability to drive people back to your site to be able to build you as a thought leader. That's really hard and it takes a lot of work. As an example, five years ago we started a platform called Milk Drunk, separate to Bobbie. Milk Drunk Blog. And the reason why we started it is because we realize that there was a dearth of education in the world of formula out there.
(00:48:15):
And what people were really looking for was good recommendations, usability charts, how to make formula, how long does formula last? So we wanted to become the content leaders in that, with the hypothesis, and it's holding true five years later, with the hypothesis that if we win on content and as a thought leader, that will drive back to Bobbie. And today I'm going to give you a totally random example. If you do a cursory Google search for something like "How long does formula last?" Milk Drunk is showing up between the CDC and the bum on the first page of Google? That SEO work and that content building and thought leadership and credibility does take a lot of work. And in the meantime, I've had to squat away requests to put another 100,000, another 300,000 every month into paid marketing because the moment that drug starts, it's very easy to keep it going.
Lenny (00:49:15):
I think Airbnb is a great example of that. During COVID, they shut down paid growth and I think they've turned it on, but it's a tiny component, which is really unusual and really rare, where you have paid growth, you're sending tons of money, Facebook, and then you stop. It's so hard to stop because growth slows and no one ever wants to do that. And it's interesting, coming back to using a crisis as an opportunity, Airbnb use that as an opportunity to get off that drug.
Laura Modi (00:49:40):
That's right. Yeah.
Lenny (00:49:42):
If you think about the pie chart of what helps Bobbie grow, how much of it would you say is just like make an awesome product that people talk about with other moms and it spreads like that, versus SEO and content and paid?
Laura Modi (00:49:55):
60% of it is your product and the package around the product, which is your brand. So even if you did nothing to market your brand, your product and brand is 60% of it. And then the last 40% is how do you get the word out there? How do you ensure the word-of-mouth, mom begets mom? That has to happen. That flywheel will only happen if they're able to look at a product that they fully believe in and a brand that speaks to them. And without that, you're going to be a fast-fashion company, which is also my worst nightmare, the fear that people get distracted by the 40% and the 60% actually is just mediocre.
Lenny (00:50:43):
Something I wasn't planning to ask, but I thought it'd be interesting and we can cut this if it's not interesting, is Emily Oster, she's one of the, I think, pioneers of breastfeeding is not as great as people say necessarily. Has that been really important to Bobbie in this industry? What do you think of Emily Oster? I'm a huge fan, so I hope you're also a big fan.
Laura Modi (00:51:01):
We are massive fans of Emily and Emily's a massive fan of Bobbie. She is my idol. She's the one who got me through my first year of pregnancy and then beyond. She has been a really, really important voice. And actually she has kind of set the stage for the power of data to bust myths. I mean, just like you said, she's come out and said, "There is no study, no study at all out there that you can point to that can qualify why breastfeeding is better." And to have an economist, a professor, come out and to be able to underscore that and point to where that is the case and why it is the case. I mean, it's so much better than a company. To be fair, companies are brands coming out trying to say that. So I am acutely aware that, as a business and as a brand, sometimes we need to bring in other credible voices. And my God, Emily is one of those.
Lenny (00:52:05):
I love it. Okay, great. I'm glad. I'm glad you love her. I've been reading all our books. I think I just read that section.
Laura Modi (00:52:11):
You read her books. I love it. You're not a dad yet, you'll like all of them, Family Firm.
Lenny (00:52:14):
Okay, the first two. The first two. Cribsheet. I'll stop there, I think. And I was actually just reading the breastfeeding section and it's funny, one of the only remaining benefits of breastfeeding is less cow farts and creating methane. Unrelated to your child, there's a cow component.
Laura Modi (00:52:32):
We do want to cut down on the farts.
Lenny (00:52:35):
We do. We do. Not what I thought of when I thought of why should I go with formula or not. Maybe just zooming out a little bit and to kind of close, are there any other lessons that you've learned along this journey about building a company, hiring, team building, anything along those lines? Creating urgency, creating momentum?
Laura Modi (00:52:56):
I mean, momentum. Momentum really is it. We did this a good bit at Airbnb too. I think as a founder and as a CEO or for any leader out there, your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured. And that has been one of my biggest lessons on just how, as leaders and people starting companies, how do you force yourself? And sometimes when it's early on, you're actually just doing it to yourself, creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates.
(00:53:36):
The amount of times people say to me, "Why are we launching this May 1st?" And I'm like, "Just because we said it. Because if we don't do it now, we may never do it." It was something we were talking about the last day on just how important it is to look at the fuel that keeps you going and how you have to kind of force those milestones to get you there. So yeah, I would say manufacture yourself some momentum.
Lenny (00:54:00):
I so agree with that. One of my favorite things and one of our former colleagues, Vanessa, taught me this, which is just like, "Let's all set an arbitrary deadline right now." And just make it clear, this is just arbitrary, but it's useful.
Laura Modi (00:54:13):
It's so true.
Lenny (00:54:15):
Well, with that, Laura, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
Laura Modi (00:54:18):
Who?
Lenny (00:54:19):
I don't know if I told you this was coming, but it is. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for exciting lightning round?
Laura Modi (00:54:26):
I think I am. Let's do it.
Lenny (00:54:27):
Okay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Laura Modi (00:54:33):
One recently, Great by Choice, the author of From Good to Great, amazing.
Lenny (00:54:40):
Jim Collins?
Laura Modi (00:54:40):
Some really, really good frameworks. Yes, that's right. Really good frameworks in there. Metabolical, very specific into the world of health, healthcare. Actually, very specifically the takeaway of Metabolical is we don't have a healthcare crisis in this country, we have a health crisis. And it really makes you think about the source, food and how we live our lives. It's amazing. And then I think you a really good traditional one, going back to just brand and for people who are really just looking for a good foundation, I love Purple Cow.
Lenny (00:55:13):
I love that. I think I have it in my back around here.
Laura Modi (00:55:15):
You do?
Lenny (00:55:15):
There it is, yeah. Tiny little book. It's so cute.
Laura Modi (00:55:18):
That is so good.
Lenny (00:55:20):
Yeah. Also, we could mention Emily Oster's book, Laura, Expecting Better.
Laura Modi (00:55:23):
I mean, we should. Expecting Better is a good classic.
Lenny (00:55:27):
Your list is reminding me of a new book by Peter Attia, that I don't know if you've seen, called Outlive, I think it's called. It's about longevity and how to live longer and all the latest sciences and how to live a longer life. But anyway, that's my answer and I'm asking you questions, so let's move on to the next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Laura Modi (00:55:44):
Bad Sisters. Do you have bad sisters?
Lenny (00:55:47):
No.
Laura Modi (00:55:48):
About a group of Irish sisters getting up to trouble. Highly recommended.
Lenny (00:55:53):
Amazing. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring people?
Laura Modi (00:55:57):
Teach me something. Actually, we just talked about that today. Teach me something. Yeah. I love getting someone to, not related to work, not related to their job, something in your life, something you find interesting, just teach me about it.
Lenny (00:56:11):
What is it that you look for in their answer that gives you a sense that they're someone that you want to hire?
Laura Modi (00:56:16):
Creative, but also just their ability to explain something, and it is a huge indicator. I mean, I'll never forget one guy teaching me how to cook the perfect steak, and now every time I cook a steak, I go back to the way he described it, to someone being able to teach me the foundation of Latin. But if someone's unable to take one thing that they find is core to who they are and what they've done or what they understand and their inability to explain that to you, they may struggle.
Lenny (00:56:49):
I want to learn how to cook a perfect steak. I'm going to have to interview you at some point and ask you about that. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love? And especially if it's a baby product, that'll be bonus.
Laura Modi (00:57:01):
I mean, yeah, I think Frida Baby's amazing, the nose sucker.
Lenny (00:57:06):
Okay, great. The nose sucker.
Laura Modi (00:57:08):
Actually, no. Sorry, the nose sucker. That's terrible. It's the snot sucker.
Lenny (00:57:13):
Okay, great.
Laura Modi (00:57:13):
As a new parent, you really, really need this, Lenny. Your poor little boy is going to get blocked up and you're going to want to get out that sucker and suck on it-
Lenny (00:57:23):
Oh, dear.
Laura Modi (00:57:23):
... and get it out. I can see you quickly looking for the next question. Move away from the snot sucker.
Lenny (00:57:30):
No, this is great.
Laura Modi (00:57:31):
So I'll leave you with that.
Lenny (00:57:33):
Perfect. We'll just call the episode The Snot Sucker. So many options. Okay, next question. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way that you build/ship product that was minor but had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute and ship?
Laura Modi (00:57:51):
More recently, async work. Moving away from meeting culture and being able to be in a position where we can work async, whether it's one-hour sprint over Slack, make decisions and go back and forth, 20 people, and then everyone's made a decision by the end of the hour and we're moving forward.
Lenny (00:58:12):
Is there a tool that helps you do that or is it just in Slack? "Here's the question we're trying to answer," and everyone-
Laura Modi (00:58:16):
You know what? Every so often we try and introduce tools and then it's like we've over-processed this entire thing, when what we really just need to do is all just get our head into the moment we're in and brand it and get it done. So even though I think we've introduced some tools, I know we use some video ones as well. I'm a little bit removed sometimes from everyone working through these tools, but I'm in the Slack world the most.
Lenny (00:58:40):
Final question, what is your best advice for a soon-to-be parent, aka, me?
Laura Modi (00:58:45):
Hire a sitter who you love that you want to have on board every Thursday night and keep your date night with Michelle, whatever your date night is, and just don't worry about the price because the date is worth it, but just lock it in and do it.
Lenny (00:59:03):
We actually have a date night currently with another couple who has two kids, and so we could just maintain that. How early do you hire a sitter to do that, in their age?
Laura Modi (00:59:13):
Second week.
Lenny (00:59:14):
Second week. Okay, great. Not first week.
Laura Modi (00:59:16):
Okay. Maybe second month. It totally depends on how you guys are feeling.
Lenny (00:59:23):
No. Okay, that early.
Laura Modi (00:59:24):
That depends on how she's feeling, but I would say sometimes you just need to rip the bandaid and you need to go for it, even if it means the two of you are just going out for a quick meal and you're coming back, keep your date night.
Lenny (00:59:33):
Laura, this was as fun and insightful as I expected. I'm going to go try some Bobbie, I'm going to go by snot suckers. Thank you so much for spending time here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Bobbie, potentially, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Laura Modi (00:59:51):
Okay. Well, the first thing I'm going to say, how listeners can be useful. I am hiring a growth product manager right now and we are really focused on optimization. So now I'm moving away from everything I just said and I want a specialist who's really good at growth optimization. And how folks can find us, our website is hibobbie, H-I bobbie, B-O-B-B-I-E.com. And if folks just want to reach out to me, I would highly recommend just sending me an email, Laura@hibobbie.com.
Lenny (01:00:20):
And for the hiring position, how do they go apply for that and learn more about it?
Laura Modi (01:00:24):
Great question. I'm assuming it's on our careers page on the website.
Lenny (01:00:27):
Great. We'll make sure it's there before this all goes out.
Laura Modi (01:00:29):
Amazing.
Lenny (01:00:30):
Laura, this is amazing. Thank you so much for being here.
Laura Modi (01:00:33):
It's such a pleasure, Lenny. This is so fun.
Lenny (01:00:35):
It's my pleasure. And goodbye, everyone.
Laura Modi (01:00:37):

# Lessons from one of the world’s top executive recruiters | Lauren Ipsen (Daversa Partners, GC)

## Transcript

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:00):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:35):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:01:05):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:01:15):
One of the most important skills for founders and senior product leaders to develop is the ability to hire great people. You won't be able to build the best company or the best product if you can't hire the best people. And Lauren is one of the most experienced and successful people in the world when it comes to hiring product leaders. She's placed over 80 senior product leaders across tech companies and has worked with some of the biggest companies out there. When I asked a bunch of really smart product leaders who their favorite product recruiter was, Lauren's name came up a ton.

Lenny (00:01:46):
In our conversation, we get super tactical about what founders need to do to find the best product talent, what product managers should be doing during their career to give themselves the most opportunity, and we also touch on what recruiters themselves often get wrong when trying to attract great talent. This episode is rich with actionable advice for basically everyone, and I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:02:12):
Who has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you.

Lenny (00:02:57):
Snowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency.

Lenny (00:03:17):
Maybe you've thought about using Retool before but just haven't, and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at retool.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.

Lenny (00:03:53):
I actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovering research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks.

Lenny (00:04:24):
Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:04:45):
Lauren, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lauren Ipsen (00:04:47):
Thanks so much. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
I've been meeting to do an episode on product hiring and recruiting product people for a while, and when I asked a bunch of smart friends who should I have on to talk about this stuff, your name came up a bunch, and so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:03):
Me too. Absolutely. I'm grateful that you asked.

Lenny (00:05:07):
So, to help listeners get a sense of just your background and kind of the journey you've been on to get to where you are now, can you just spend maybe just a minute kind of talking through the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're doing now?

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:19):
Yeah, absolutely. So I started my career in broadcast. I originally thought that I wanted to be on the news and quickly realized I didn't necessarily want to be the face of sadness. There's a ton of that happening in the world.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:36):
So, made a pivot pretty early on and thought, where could I use the communication skills that I've been working so hard on and do something that's impactful in a big way, but maybe just with a little bit of a different angle? And stumbled across executive search.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:52):
Exec search is not really something that people major in college by any means or think they're going to end up doing. So it was something I found fascinating. I had applied to all of these different companies like Twitter and Snap and Pinterest, hadn't heard back from any of them, was a name in the resumes, and thought, well, how cool would it be if I could work with all of them and have an opportunity to play a part from a different lens?

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:18):
So, got into exec search, was really focused early on on consumer mobile build outs. Was doing a lot of work with Twitter and Reddit and TaskRabbit and Nextdoor, Postmates, you name it, and that was probably 85% of the work I was doing. And then as, on the agency side, 15% was obscure, autonomous helicopters selling into the Department of Defense and then retail and robotics, and it was all very fascinating, but for me, who has wicked bad ADD, it was amazing to be able to be so stimulated by so many different industries and feel like I couldn't really master this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:57):
So, long story short, had an awesome career at Daversa Partners, which is a boutique executive search firm, and thought I was going to be there potentially forever. Was tapped by a awesome individual, Abe Shafi, who was founding a company. I had been doing a lot of work for them. They were a client of mine at the time. Placed a couple great hires and they said, "We're either going to kick off a head of talent search with you or you can come over and join us." So I was the first recruiting hire over there, built out the talent function in its entirety.

Lauren Ipsen (00:07:27):
I definitely think there was a part of me that I loved the operating experience, learned a ton, worked side by side some amazing people, but was really missing working with founders, and lots of them, and keeping a pulse on the market. So General Catalyst tapped me most recently, and been working here for the past couple months, and it's been great thus far, and I'm specializing in our consumer and crypto investments.

Lenny (00:07:51):
Awesome. The fact that you're at GC now makes me think about another recruiter that I know who's awesome, Austin Brizendine, and it's interesting that a lot of the best recruiters seem to be heading to VC funds, and I'm curious why that is happening. Is it like a comp thing? Is it other things that are pulling everyone away into funds?

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:09):
It's a great question. It's definitely not a comp thing. I'll say that. I think it could be a stability of life thing. Search is incredibly volatile, and you have to hustle so hard, and as soon as you have three wins, you've got four more things to execute on. And so, there's aspects of it that can be tough, especially in a market like right now where you really do have to chase business and you can't be selective about what you take on, so you could be pitching things that maybe you don't necessarily believe in in its entirety or what have you. So, I think that's one component.

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:39):
In house is obviously difficult right now as well for talent leaders. It's really scary to take a bet on one single company right now and know what it's going to look like six months from now. And so I think those things combined might be the reason for an influx in folks leaning more towards venture, and I think it's just timeliness.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. That makes sense. The downside is it's hard for people to find awesome recruiters because once you're in a fund, you're just going to help those startups. And so we're going to talk later about just how do people find awesome recruiters, what do you look for? But there's roughly three things I want to spend our time chatting through today. One is for founders and hiring managers, just how to find the best talent and what they could do to be successful finding the best talent. Two is for product leaders and PMs, how to give themselves the most opportunity from the flip side. And then third is just for recruiters, what do they often do wrong? How do they miss out on the best product talent? Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:37):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:09:39):
Okay, cool. So on the hiring front, just diving in, say you are a founder, you're someone really early at a company, and maybe you've got a couple PMs and you're starting to think about we need to hire a really senior product leader or first senior product leader.

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:52):
Sure.

Lenny (00:09:53):
What do you find is often the biggest mistake that founders make when they're trying to hire their first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:59):
I think especially for founders that haven't hired for this caliber of talent in the past, it's really easy to be distracted by shiny objects and look at huge names. You want to find the CPOs of Google and YouTube or what have you because that seems like it would be such an incredible opportunity for brand recognition. And to an extent, it is. But the fact of the matter is, oftentimes those individuals are pretty far from the work and have a great team of executors that they've put into place that are actually the ones that are in the weeds.

Lauren Ipsen (00:10:33):
And so I think that's the biggest mistake I see people make, especially on the hiring front where they have limited resources, and maybe they're an early stage company and trying so hard to bring in big names is not always the best way to go about it because the fact of the matter is they need to go then hire a team. So, I think looking for someone that's a little closer to the work, maybe someone that can step up into that type of role and do so in a way where some days they might actually be operating like a PM and then other days they might be able to build from a leadership perspective, that's more of the DNA that people should be targeting.

Lenny (00:11:09):
Do you think the source of the issue with that going wrong, that they no longer can do that work as well because they've been shielded away from the tactical day to day? Or is it that they're not as hungry as they used to be and they're just like, "I already, I'm a YouTube 10 year super success, I don't need to prove myself anymore," and they're just not as hungry, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:29):
I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say that all senior leaders aren't hungry. I think that there's some folks that really lean into the work in a different way and miss that, and often go to startups because they crave building.

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:41):
So it's not necessarily that, but I do tend to lean towards folks that have a chip on their shoulder or have something to prove and want to build a name for themselves. All of that to say, there's a reason that a lot of those people got to where they are, and some of the best talent are some of the senior folks, but just maybe not necessarily the best talent for where this company is today. Right? It could be great for 10 years down the road, but the past five years of that individual's career could have been far more focused on camaraderie, team building, operational components, performance reviews, and then aspects of product vision, which just might not be the innovative AB testing type of profile that you typically look for in these pre-IPO companies.

Lenny (00:12:27):
Got it. I imagine there are stories that you can share about people you've placed like that, that have not worked out. If you can share one, that'd be awesome. But maybe a side question is the general advice, just don't assume someone that's been successful at a big company with a fancy background is going to be great. Sometimes they work out, but not always, is that kind of the takeaway?

Lauren Ipsen (00:12:46):
Yeah. I would say the general advice is who is going to be best for this specific role at this specific time, not necessarily who is the best talent in the world or in the market. Those are two very, very different questions to ask. And I think early on in my recruiting career, I was often just trying to recruit these whales of executives to try and prove myself and say, "Oh, I got this person to entertain this opportunity, how sick is that?" But naturally, that's not necessarily the person that actually can move the needle. And so you need to think very specifically. Just because this is the best talent, that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best talent for this role today.

Lenny (00:13:25):
So to double down on that, say you are hiring and you know you're going to start hiring a senior product leader, what is it that you suggest founders nail down and iron out when they're kicking off the hiring process, either on their own or with a recruiter? Like, in the job description, what else do they have to get right to find the right person?

Lauren Ipsen (00:13:48):
It's a number of things, like product leaders can come in a lot of different flavors, and so I think it's trying to determine where this person should major and minor, where they should spike. Is this someone that's going to really lean into the design efforts? Is it someone that actually kind of needs to just operate like a very senior PM and continue to build out a team? Is this someone that really should be focused on product vision for the long haul? And then thinking more holistically about how to build the rest of the team.

Lauren Ipsen (00:14:12):
There's so many different ways in which you can hire for a product leader. So I think it's trying to work a little bit backwards and think about, what is the actual outcome that we are trying to solve for with this hire? Or are we just hiring a head of product because we feel like we need to hire a head of product? That's so often what I see is the board's telling me we need to hire a head of product and I don't necessarily think that we do, or I'm not exactly sure what we need in this role. And so whenever you're starting a search in that regard, it's kind of doomed from inception, so you need to get incredibly granular on the front end around, what is this person going to be coming in to do? What's their mandate? And if we think about someone that's just absolutely hitting it out of the park and crushing it, what does that look like? So I think just trying to be really specific on the front end.

Lenny (00:14:59):
I love that last piece, just what does success really look like for this person? On the first piece, that's exactly the same advice I give founders when they're looking for a PM is like, what do you concretely need them to do day to day? Not like, "We need someone to help us with product." And that often helps illuminate, okay, I see. We need someone to help us ship more consistently. We need someone to help us hire engineers. Yeah, just make a list. What are they going to do in the first month or two or three?

Lauren Ipsen (00:15:24):
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think those are the most important things. Like the 90 day plan is something that's overused but so necessary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So that component and then, okay, a year from now, what should this person be doing? Two years from now? Do we want them to grow up into a CPO role? Do we think about that in a different way? How are we thinking about the product direction today, 12 months from now, 18 months from now, through IPO? I think it's really difficult to think about things that way, and so often you're thinking about the task in front of you and just trying to iterate quickly, but that is the type of thought process that needs to be happening from the CEOs and founders.

Lenny (00:16:06):
Are there archetypes of PMs, if you just bucket like here's the three maybe most common types of product leaders that founders hire, because there's an infinite list of skills and things they could do, but just to make it even simpler, like here's probably one of these three you're looking for. Do you have something like that in your head?

Lauren Ipsen (00:16:25):
Yeah, there's platform product leaders or folks that are kind of more indexed on the infrastructure components. There's folks that are typically focused on core product, or consumer product if it's on the consumer side of things. And then you'll have folks that are really indexed and that can include UX individuals, design folks. And then there's also typically specialists, so individuals that are really hyper-focused on growth or monetization or what have you. Those are the three buckets that I would say I see most often.

Lenny (00:16:57):
Do you feel like founders sometimes pick one of the wrong buckets and that's a common mistake, or is it generally it's the wrong bucket but then maybe it's not the right spikes of skills within that bucket?

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:08):
Well, it's kind of twofold. I think sometimes people just bring in a head of product to do everything, so that's probably not the best way to go about things. I think that ends up being a unicorn, which you hear often in the search world, and it becomes really difficult to hone in on what good looks like.

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:25):
And so I think again, it just comes back to having a clear org chart on the front end and determining, are we hiring someone specifically to build out our walled garden ads approach, or are we hiring someone to run product marketing, or are we hiring someone to help from a product perspective to build a better core user experience? Those are all very, very, very different roles, and if you bring in one person to try and do it all, the facts of the matter is, they're going to have to bring in some key lieutenants to help them, so is that something you want to do or are you more focused on bringing in someone imminently to help on the ad side of things, and then we can find that head of product to help them out down the road?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:05):
That's kind of the way in which I would architect it and think about it, is what's most imminent, and what do you actually need to hire for today, as opposed to just hiring for the sake of hiring and bringing in that leader.

Lenny (00:18:17):
And part of the discussion there is maybe they grow up into this head of product long term, maybe not. Maybe we just need someone to ship the ads platform, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:24):
That's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:18:26):
You mentioned this title of head of product. There's also VP of product, CPO. There's all these titles and I feel like people sometimes use them interchangeably, don't know which one to use when they're putting out a job description. Do you have any kind of heuristic rule of thumb of just, here's how to think about when to use each of these titles? Or is it not even a big deal for, say, a founder, hiring the first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:48):
It's a great question and it definitely leads to confusion across the board because I'll have candidates come to me and they'll say, "I'm only looking for a CPO role," when I'm working with a startup where, maybe on the venture side of things, we've actually advised that startup to not hire C-level executives at this point. And so that naturally could eliminate a candidate that could be amazing for the role.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:15):
Similarly, people could feel that way if it's a VP of product role, but that in their mind is the most senior product leader within the organization running everything from end to end who they intend to be the CPO down the road but are not in a position where they're ready to hire C-level execs. So, it's tough, and it really depends on the organization and the way in which they're thinking about org charts and leveling.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:39):
A lot of startups at this point are almost allergic to C titles or VP titles or are just more title agnostic than I've seen in the past, so you see a lot more of these head ofs, and that is sector leaders, up until probably C plus or D stage. And then you get to D and E, and you'll see more of the VP, director, CPO type. And I think that is the way that people should be thinking about it is, if I'm joining a company very, very early days and it's called head of engineering, that is intended to be the most senior engineering leader within the organization.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:19):
The fact of the matter though is there's good reason sometimes why they're not throwing out that C title, and could this person be layered down the road? Potentially, because maybe the talent they need right now is different than, just as we had spoken to earlier, is different than the talent that they might need from a massive CPO in two and a half years.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:37):
And so I think that rubs people the wrong way because they want a bit of a promise that things are going to, if they join at this stage, that they'll be in it for the long haul and be that chief product officer that takes a company through an IPO. But companies are so dynamic and things change so quickly.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:52):
So, I guess a long-winded way of me saying there's different breadth and depth to each role, but I think for the most part, unless it's a very siloed company with multiple different VPs, if you're coming into a company and they say this is the head of product, the VP of product, or the CPO, that all means the same thing dependent on the stage, for the most part.

Lenny (00:21:14):
And the other takeaway there, which is awesome, is if you're early stage startup, probably just start with head of product. Keep it simple.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Don't over promise. Everyone understands.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:22):
Yeah. Because the last thing you want to do is have to demote someone. But once you get to a place of having C-level executives, like that's not going to do any good, but maybe you start as a head of product, and then as the company continues to grow, you lean into the growth side of things more, and so you become that head of growth or an SVP of growth. Like things iterate and change, but you just never know and you can't predict the outcome of a company on the front end, so.

Lenny (00:21:49):
A lot of people listening to this probably aren't hiring senior product leaders right now, but plan to and will in the future, and so I wanted to ask, what should founders do when they know they will hire a head of product, say, in the next year, that could set them up for success down the road? What should they be doing ahead of time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:07):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:43):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:23:11):
That sounds awesome and it makes sense. How do you, as a founder, do some of that? Do you just ask folks like, "Hey, who are some of the best product leaders you know? I just want to chat with them. I'm not hiring, just want to kind of meet people who are awesome." Is that the behavior you suggest or is there something else you can do?

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:27):
That's a great way to go about it. And by simply saying, "No agenda, I'm not trying to hire you tomorrow, I just want to know great people." And to be totally honest, people feel flattered by that, typically. Most of the time if you've been referred to someone and heard nothing but great things about them and you really don't have an agenda other than wanting to pick their brain, people are like, "Huh, well, this is different from the day to day. This is fulfilling," and people want to pour their knowledge, especially into companies that they believe in.

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:58):
So, I think more often than not you'll find that, not just products leaders, but executives across the board are actually really inclined to do so and want to help out because it's a little bit different from the day to day monotony of their work life.

Lenny (00:24:12):
So, the advice is keep track of companies who are killing it, who you might be able to kind of poach from in the future, and keep a list and keep warm contact with folks that are awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:23):
It reminds me of a founder that ... or basically all founders who are really good at hiring and how far ahead they plant seeds and how they just play the long game with the best people they meet, and they just kind of keep the conversation going until they finally convince them to join a year or two later. Do you find that the same thing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:41):
Yeah, 1000000%. Yeah. When I was on the executive recruiting side of things at Daversa, the VP of engineering candidate that we ultimately landed, it was a seven month game of courtship, and let's bring him in to help out from an advising capacity, let's ask him how he would think about structuring this organization, let's talk to him about the best talent that he would recommend that we're spending time with. No question that's invasive, but more so just collaborative and exciting, and you'll find that the founder and that leader will build a different level of rapport and trust by not going through a formal interview process and having it feel transactional. And then with that, magic can happen and you can land incredible people.

Lenny (00:25:24):
This all sounds like a lot of work and a lot of time. Do you have guidance on how long it should take to find, like for a early stage startup, say series A or B, to find someone awesome, and/or how much time founders should spend a week, just best practice, on hiring for someone like this?

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:41):
I mean, I think if you're going to search, so if you're looking for this individual, it's really so case to case. There's searches that I've been in that I call three people. I know they're amazing for this. I tell the founder and CEO, "These are the three people you should chat with, hire one of them." And it's that easy.

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:59):
There's others where it's a lot of trying to figure out what the person's actually looking for. If there's some ... they hit it off from an emotional standpoint. There's so many different things that come with it. I would say from a timing perspective, it's not a hard number. It's more of just put yourself in the room with great people. If you have a tremendous amount of respect for someone, continue to harvest that relationship and ask what good looks like. Find excuses to continue to touch base with people that are important in your network. If you remembered that they'd mentioned that they were going to some event and you think that you might want to hire them down the road, in a non-creepy way, show up to that event. These are things that I'm constantly doing, and I think that founders can do a better job of, but just make yourself known and relevant. And then when you reach out and timing is right, it won't feel so obscure or so transactional.

Lenny (00:26:55):
That reminds me of a time at Airbnb where we had these meetups for engineers every month or so where it was a tech talk, and then all the engineers get a target engineer that is coming to the event. Like they get their profile and their picture, and their job is to make sure they have a great time and try to convince them to join someday.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:14):
Oh my god. But it's so real. It's similar to college trips where you're trying to get recruited for a sport, and you have to ensure that you're, yeah, just continuing to give people the best experience possible and staying top of mind for people.

Lenny (00:27:28):
Yeah. But I can see it being creepy, They have no idea there's this person assigned to them, but it works. It worked great. It was a great tactic.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:35):
That's awesome.

Lenny (00:27:36):
I want to come back to a question that I asked, but I feel like you'll have an actual more concrete answer to the specific piece of just, what's your guidance per week how much time you should be spending on hiring broadly, and specifically, heads of product, if that's any different. Do you have any just advice? Because I imagine it's always spend more time than you think. It's going to take a lot of time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:54):
Yeah, it's definitely spend more time than you think. If you are in an actual search, then you should devote all of your time to it. I know that sucks to hear, but you should be really carving out concrete time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:05):
The thing that's tough though is you could spend, I guess what I was trying to say is you could spend one hour on something or you could spend 10 hours on it, but it's more so around, are you doing things to be impactful during that period of time? Are you actually doing things that are going to move the needle? Are you just blindly reaching out to people on LinkedIn? Because that's not going to be the way in which you're going to find the best of the best. Some of the greatest talent, they're not even on LinkedIn.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:32):
And so I think it's building a really strong network in advance, and then once you actually get to a place where you need to hire that person, calling all of those amazing people that you've built relationships with and saying, "Now tell me who your favorite person is and who the best person you've ever worked with is, and could you put me on a thread with them?" How are you going to differentiate yourself from the rest of the market? So it's less in my mind like a quantitative number of hours and more of, how are you doing things differently than the rest of the market?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I want to pull on this thread. Okay, so spending one hour versus 10 hours, and your point about how you could spend one hour and get as much done maybe in those 10 hours. What sorts of behaviors and actions should folks take to make use of, say, that one hour in hiring? How do you not waste your time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:18):
I mean, I would say I've got probably five of my all time favorite product leaders in the world that I tap whenever I'm kicking off a search. And they know that whenever life brings them to an opportunity where they are going to start looking or want to lean into board opportunities, that I'm going to set them up and shout their name from the rooftop, so oftentimes they're willing to point me in the right direction of great people, make those introductions, what have you, and I'm going to know simply because of how great they are that they would never put me in touch with someone that wasn't equally as qualified.

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:55):
So that I think because the quality is there, so I'm not just blindly guessing on quantity, spending a ton of time on LinkedIn, and then having to call unknown entities and ask for back channel references when they also might not even feel comfortable sharing the dirt. You know? So it comes back to rapport and people that you have around you that you know you can trust and tap into and ensuring that you're spending the time in the right areas.

Lenny (00:30:19):
Got it. Yeah, so tapping your network makes a lot of sense. If you don't have that yet, I guess is it worth spending time on LinkedIn just cold messaging people as a founder, and any tips there for just cold outreach that you think work for a founder doing it versus you who are a professional at it?

Lauren Ipsen (00:30:37):
I do think it is worth that time. If you see someone that looks amazing, hell yeah, reach out to them, spend time with them, why not? And oftentimes, again, people are excited to see, oh, this CEO and founder wants to pick my brain, doesn't look like they're coming at me to try and recruit me, but rather just to have an open-ended conversation. For sure, and they can sense. You can definitely sense that type of interaction and feel comfortable with it, whereas sometimes the walls immediately go up when someone senses that they're trying to get poached.

Lauren Ipsen (00:31:08):
And so it's I think something that's worth them doing for sure. It's just if you are going to look for a key executive and are on a time crunch, I don't necessarily think the best use of your time is blindly reaching out to executives when you don't necessarily have the expertise in knowing which companies were thriving during that period of time, which organizations were great, and which were a little bit weaker within companies. All of those things are just the inner workings of the recruiting atmosphere and technology, and I think tapping people, if you don't have the network, talk to a great recruiter or just spend some time kind of doing some research on who's great. You can ask investors or board members in your companies as to who you should be targeting. So there's always got to be one or two people that can at least point you to another three or four.

Lenny (00:31:56):
That reminds me of a tactic Gokul shared on this podcast about one of his best tricks, as you think of, if you're hiring salespeople, instead of looking for who are just the best salespeople, you look for the company that is known for being really good at sales and then you go find people there and try to poach their lieutenant types, not maybe necessarily their head of sales. Do you think that's a good move?

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:17):
Yes and no.

Lenny (00:32:18):
Ooh.

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:19):
Yes and no, because I think if the organization is incredibly good at sales then the majority of the folks are probably amazing, but you always have weak links, and just because someone has a brand on their resume at the right time, I think oftentimes CEOs and founders will do this thing where they kind over generalize, well, Amazon's Prime team at this time was amazing or something like that. It's like, they definitely could have been, but just as any other company, there's going to be people that are breakout, top 1% type individuals, and then other individuals that get to ride the wave and reap the benefits of being at the right place at the right time. And I think that's a good starting place, but then also spending time getting a little bit deeper on who the best people are within that organization. But yeah, we always start with market mapping, so determining who the best companies are within a specific area, and then I just encourage everyone to take that a layer deeper.

Lenny (00:33:16):
Got it. It just comes back to your previous piece of advice. Don't assume someone that has an awesome logo is going to be great, but sometimes they are. There's a question I should have asked you at the beginning that I'm going to ask now. How many folks have you placed? How many companies have you worked with? And then also, is there a story of just your favorite person that you've placed/company you've helped hire that comes to mind?

Lauren Ipsen (00:33:36):
Yeah. So both great questions. I've placed probably 85 executives over the course of my career, and then lots of entry level employees when I was in house, and also some great key leaders. Yeah, probably 85 searches that I've opened and closed, so that's been incredibly fulfilling work. It's also fun too on the exec side of things because you hire the VP of engineering at Postmates and you see firsthand the product change. You know, you watch those types of things happen before your eyes, which is, it's fulfilling stuff, it's really cool.

Lenny (00:34:09):
And delivery gets there faster too.

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:10):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, that's really fun. Favorite placement of all time has got to be the VP of engineering that I placed at IRL, which is, to be completely honest, a big reason that I joined that company. Alex Strand is his name, and he is just the most incredible, atypical, high emotional intelligent engineering leader. Still super technical, but has managed teams in the hundreds, built out Amazon Prime Day, then went on to build the core messaging platform at Snapchat, called him and he was like, "Why would I ever leave? There's a ton of financial incentive and a team that I've built that all loves me."

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:54):
And we got him to ultimately make a move in two weeks, which is just kind of unheard of, although it ended up being like a seven month push for a start date, but that was a big reason why I went and joined IRL was to work side by side him and help build out his team and learn to get more deep on the technical side of things. Because oftentimes, on the executive level, as mentioned before, can be sometimes more of that people management type role. And so he just felt like this unique hybrid of an individual, and yeah, you close searches and you cross your fingers and hope for the best and feel very good about it, but he was one where I had all the confidence in the world that I could not have done better. You know? I just felt so great about that. So, that was a good one.

Lenny (00:35:38):
I don't know how much more confidence you could instill in a candidate joining a company than the recruiter also then joining the company.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:44):
Yeah, I did say that to him. I kept saying, "And if I were to go in house, I swear this is probably the company I would do it for." And then about four weeks after he signed, I'd texted him and I said, "Well, you'll never guess."

Lenny (00:35:58):
Wow.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:00):
Amazing. What a stamp of confidence.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:02):
Yeah. And a full circle life moment. I sent him a box of cookies, he sent it back and said, "Your turn."

Lenny (00:36:07):
And is he still there at IRL? Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:09):
Yes, he is. He's great.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

Lenny (00:36:37):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

Lenny (00:36:51):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2.

Lenny (00:37:29):
I want to shift a little bit to kind of flip to the product person's perspective and talk about, how do you be successful as a product leader in finding new opportunities and giving yourself opportunities in the space? And so maybe a first question is just generally, what should product leaders and PMs focus on to give themselves the most opportunity in their career?

Lauren Ipsen (00:37:51):
I think breadth is incredibly important. It's so critical, especially if someone has an end goal of wanting to step into a product leadership role to have been able to have touched lots of different components, as opposed to specializing in one specific thing. So I would say that's very important, to be able to make sure that you're maximizing opportunities for yourself down the road.

Lauren Ipsen (00:38:12):
And then as mentioned before, just always keeping a pulse on the market, regardless of how happy you are in your current company, regardless of what the project is that you're so incredibly excited about that isn't going to conclude until Q1 of next year. It's just so important that you always know the companies that are doing great things and keep those windows open for people, because you never know what the next 12 months hold, and you want to be in a position where you're never running out the door looking for what's next, but rather being able to be super selective about the things that you have in front of you. And that comes with time and network building and relationship building over years, honestly.

Lenny (00:38:54):
And when you say breadth, are you saying things like work on the platform team for a bit, work on the user facing team, maybe the internal tools team, like different types of product, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:04):
Exactly that. Yeah. I think there's people that probably want to just be a specialist in growth, or want to get super deep on ads, and if that's the case, then by all means, do so. And I think there's something to be said about that as well because those types of skillsets will be needed. But if you're looking to diversify your skillset, continue to grow from a career trajectory perspective and think about potentially being in a head of product type role, I think it's really important that you touch all aspects of that.

Lenny (00:39:38):
I'm really happy to hear that because that's exactly the advice I give new PMs is that a variety of experience is one of the most powerful things you can do because you also just become a better PM because you can see how different types of products are built and how different types of teams operate and it just makes you better.

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:52):
Yes. Variety of experience, I think taking a bet on doing something more entrepreneurial, starting something, and then also joining things that are a little bit later and more established to get best practices. I think diversifying your skillset within an organization but also diversifying the work in which you're doing and the companies that you're spending time with is awesome.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Yeah. So on that, something I'm always weary of is folks jumping around between all the fancy companies to get a bunch of logos on the resume. "Oh, I worked at Snap and Facebook and Netflix," and I feel like you're just building a resume and then your life flies by, and you forget that you should enjoy the things you're doing and work on things that are fulfilling and optimized for not a great resume. And, curious your thoughts on just how often you think you should move from company to company, one to optimize for opportunities in the future, or just generally, do you recommend people try to move around or go deeper at their company? There's a bunch of questions there, but take it wherever you want to.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:01):
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sounds good. I think it's an interesting one because logo collecting is never something that you want to be known for, and the first thing you're taught, like entry level recruiting 101 is recognize patterns of candidates that jump from place to place and don't give opportunities a full chance. So, you're spot on. That is definitely not something you want to be known for if you're a prospect.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:27):
There's also something to be said about staying somewhere too long though. And I will say that. I think sometimes you find people that are almost loyal to a fault, and companies have tanked and all executives have left and the writing's on the wall, and they're holding onto the fact that they were hired by a really good guy or gal and they want to make it work because they care about the human being, and I think sometimes in your career you do have to be a little bit more selfish and think about what's going to be best for you in the long haul. And so maybe that is still keeping your head down and working hard while also being thoughtful about other things that are out there and not saying hard nos to opportunities that knock on your door.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:12):
So it's one where I would say it's an art and a science because you have to be thoughtful about taking on new things and knowing when it's worth taking a bet on yourself, but also you can't run as soon as things get hard because that is recognized, and if there's a riff or an internal dispute or a new leader brought in, and that is so quick as to make you run for the fences, that's not something that people look for because startup world is hard, tech is hard. Look at the crypto world right now. Things are incredibly volatile and difficult, and you want to be able to bring people in that are going to hang with you through the highs and lows.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:55):
We're always looking to see where people moved the needle, especially on the product side, where their fingerprints were, what they can actually point to that they did and are proud of during their time there. And so if all that they can say that they did was onboarded and moved on, then doesn't matter where you were, but it's not going to be something that I can at least stand on to cheer you on.

Lenny (00:43:22):
I really like that. A lot of this comes down to, what impact have you made? And I was going to touch on that, and your point is, one, kind of heuristic for how long to stay at a place at the minimum is have some meaningful impact you can point to that you led. Does that sound right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:43:35):
Yeah, exactly. And have that meaningful impact be something that others can speak to. I think that's huge. If you built something within the organization that you're proud of but no one knows about it, then that's more difficult to have as your stamp of approval for what you are able to accomplish there. But if you did something that cross-functional leaders were speaking to, that your team all sings the praises of, then that is something that you can put a feather in the cap and say, "Okay, I left this place better than I found it, and that's the reason that I have decided to move forward."

Lenny (00:44:15):
And I imagine part of that is reference checks. People are going to check to see if you actually were successful.

Lauren Ipsen (00:44:20):
All the time. Yup. Whether you are exploratory, opportunistic, not looking at all, people are constantly calling each other, and the world of tech is so, so, so small, and no matter how fired up you were leaving a company or what went sideways, it is so critical that you try to leave the place better than you found it and do so as seamlessly as possible, because you want people to have nothing but positive to say. And oftentimes, that ... The thing that I always find too is if I call 10 people that were a part of the same organization as someone during a given period of time and they can't speak to anything they did, in that case, no news is not necessarily good news. You want to have an impact, you want to be able to say, "I did X, Y and Z. I'm super proud of this and the reason I moved on is because I did what I came in to accomplish."

Lenny (00:45:20):
It's a little bit innately tricky for product leaders. I imagine you run into this, that sometimes you have to upset people as a product leader to get stuff done that needs to get done and maybe they disagree and then later it's like, okay, I see what you did. Is that true? Do you deal with that or is it generally like, oh, yeah, they're the great people everyone knows, like a hundred percent of people will say they're awesome?

Lauren Ipsen (00:45:38):
It's a really good question. I think there's a way to navigate conflict without rubbing people the wrong way so that they'll say negative things. There's a way to be an impactful product leader and disagree and make change, and maybe your engineering leader and design leader and marketing leader completely disagree with the direction in which you're going, but because you have all of the data to support it and because you have gone about things in a way that feels very fact first and less emotional, it's really difficult for them to then point to why they disliked this person.

Lenny (00:46:19):
Yeah. This is interesting. So say you make those 10 calls, in your experience, the leaders you want to hire, are you finding 10 out of 10 are generally like, "Yes, this person's amazing, you should hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:31):
There's ones that are slam dunks and no one has any negative to say. That's incredibly rare. More often you find some people like to just have something negative to say, just to have something negative to say. I also take all of my back channels with a grain of salt. Maybe the person I'm calling to back channel this person with I also haven't back channeled, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:50):
So every single thing that you hear, you just take, make note of, and then move on and think more holistically about. But I think typically what I would say is the glaring nos are very obvious. People that are polarizing individuals or have done wrong within an organization or made bad calls across the board are, you can get that information typically pretty quick.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:13):
It's the mixed ones where it's, "I think that person was decent," those are pretty tough, and you need to really find people that worked super closely with them because otherwise it's pretty difficult to say whether or not they were able to make an impact. Which again comes back to why right off the bat it's so nice to just have people that you can tap within every organization that's like an academy company or a great company and say, "Point me in the direction of the three best people." I don't want to have to go through the burden of having to try and back channel all of the maybe middle 50% or what have you.

Lenny (00:47:48):
Yeah, most people don't have that, which is a reason to hire, work with a recruiter. You come build in with all of that network.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:55):
Totally. Totally there. Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:56):
There's a couple things I want to touch on that I wasn't planning to touch on, but reference calls. You do a lot of them, I imagine. And I'm curious, do you have any tips for how to ask questions on a reference call where you actually get useful advice where it's not just, "Yes, I like them, they're great. Hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:11):
Especially on references, provided references, I've only had two candidates where provided references have come back negative, which that's tough. Outside of that, typically references are a standard. It is important to dig pretty deep and ask the hard questions.

Lenny (00:48:28):
What's the hard questions?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:29):
Yeah, why would I not hire this person? What are their biggest weaknesses? And then if they give you the typical, "Oh, if they work too hard," it's like, no, tell me more. What are their actual weaknesses? What are things that we should be really cognizant of? Would you hire this person again? Would you report to this person? Would you endorse this person if you knew that your name was attached to it? Things like that I think get people thinking, and even if you just sense the slightest pause, that in itself will be enough to make you think twice. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:04):
So it's a lot of reading the room and probing harder than you think necessary, which is tough. But back channel references I think will always provide a greater source of truth than provided. It's similar to an Instagram Reel as opposed to the photos you're tagged in. That's the way I think of it. It's like this is what you want the world to see or think of you as, and then these are what your peers and your direct reports and the people around you actually say about the work that you did during this time.

Lenny (00:49:33):
Awesome. Coming back to a point you made about recruiter training 101, you learn how to find patterns and red flags in people's resume. What else is a red flag in your resume that you want to avoid/there's a rule of thumb of like, if you're at a place for less than a year, it's bad. Is that true? How do you feel about that? How do hiring managers generally feel about that?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:53):
It definitely depends, with regards to being at a place less than a year. If that's a recurring theme, of course that's a big red flag. Even if it's happened two or three times, three definitely. If it's happened twice, it's like, "Huh, that feels off." You got to let people tell their story though and their side of things, and again, it comes back to reaching out to different people and understanding if what they're saying is true was actually the truth. And so when you have a really good pulse on what's happening in tech and whether there was a riff and the reason that person was let go was actually because they weren't prioritizing a certain part of the product or whatever, like those things, it happens. That's life, especially right now, right? If we were to X every single person that has a short stint that joined a new company over the course of the past year, that wouldn't do anyone any good.

Lauren Ipsen (00:50:44):
Another thing I've found that's pretty interesting is that people will often, because they're so afraid of that narrative, they'll often not include on their resume companies that they didn't stay for a year. And in my personal opinion, that's actually almost more of a red flag because that did happen, and you don't want to just pretend like that wasn't a decision you made in your life, and usually is handled with grace. You can speak to the reason that you decided to make a bet, the reason that you went there, and the reason that you moved on, in a way that people can typically resonate with. But I've seen executives just put that they've simply been advising for two years or something like that, when in reality they had two companies that failed.

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:33):
And the fact of the matter is, I have some CFO candidates I'm talking to right now and their past three years have been short stints because they were brought in to take a company through an IPO and then that changed, or they were brought in to enter into a SPAC and then that became less of the buzz. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:51):
So these things happen and roles change, and I think it's just allowing people to tell their story is the most important thing. So I would say red flag is, for me, just always be honest about when you started, when you left a company. If I see that someone still has present on their LinkedIn but they've been gone for two years and they kind of are acting like they're still there, that doesn't feel good. Just want people to give you the truth, the straight facts, so that you can support them and tell their story and represent them in a way that makes you feel like you have all the details.

Lenny (00:52:23):
Got it. So basically, don't lie. That makes sense. That reminds me a little bit of people kind of upgrade their titles a little bit because maybe they don't have an official title or they just want to sound a little important. How do you feel about when people do that on their resumes?

Lauren Ipsen (00:52:35):
Yeah, I don't love that. I also don't love on the resume when people, and some people do this and it's okay, but when people say silly, vague names like they'll say something along the lines of, "Whatever at Reddit," as their title or, "Master of blank at this," and it's like, okay, what were you actually doing?

Lenny (00:52:58):
But I think they do that to avoid recruiters reaching out to them.

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:00):
Exactly. As their direct target, I'm pissed. So I feel directly attacked in that regard. So that's something that throws me off, but that could definitely be a personal thing. And I think overall, for the most part, people don't have any other things that really just throw me for a loop. And the fact of the matter is, resumes we look at less and less, especially at the executive level, and it's a lot more of allowing people to tell their story, meeting in person, talking with their different people that support them, and getting kind of more of the big picture around who they are.

Lenny (00:53:33):
I want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question: do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:45):
I've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it seems obvious, but you would be surprised how not obvious it is.

Lauren Ipsen (00:54:10):
So thinking about things more holistically, speaking honestly about your strengths and things that you want to continue to grow and improve upon, and then being able to tell your story, like practice telling your story. So often people don't do that, especially when they're not looking for jobs, and then it's not until their 10th interview that they know how to tell their story and what they did and what they impacted and why they were someone to be missed when they moved on. Those are things that you want to know how to speak to, and unless it's something you've been doing or practicing, it's less natural. That's some advice I think just off the top of the head.

Lenny (00:54:45):
Awesome. That's really good advice. One thing that makes me think about, I know I want to get to this last section, but do you think the best product leaders have their kind of story figured out in the future and work backwards from that and have a sense of where they want to end up, or just kind of take it as it goes? Because I'm the latter. I had no plan, I just went to see ... follow the path that was presented. Do you think that is generally true for folks that end up being successful, or do you recommend people think about, "Here's where I want to be in five years, here's what I need to do to get there"? Do you have any guidance there?

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:18):
I mean, for what it's worth, I'm definitely more with you. I don't know where I want to be in five years, so it's tough for me to say. But I do think that typically someone that has the end goal of being a CEO will put the pieces into place to try and get there, and so it's not a bad idea if you do have an end goal of wanting to run your own thing to inch towards that. So maybe you go from being a product specific leader to then operating in some type of GM of a business unit capacity and owning a P&L, and then although it's more of a product oriented role, you're still getting closer and closer to that end goal of COO or CEO.

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:53):
So if it's something like that, then I think that naturally makes sense. Do think people can be enticed by shiny objects, so excited because it's a step up from a title perspective and things like that, and I think that's just so not important in the grand scheme of things. You could be the VP of product or a CPO of what, you know? That's so vague. If someone just says, "I want to be a chief product officer, that's the end goal," I always say, "Of what?" You could be the chief product officer of your household. Is it of a multi-billion dollar consumer brand or ...

Lauren Ipsen (00:56:32):
So I guess what I'm trying to say is work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile.

Lenny (00:57:01):
I love that advice. So many people just chase some fancy new role, new title, new logo, and end up getting there like, "Man, this sucks."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:08):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:57:09):
This reminds me, I did a meditation retreat once and one of the teachings there was you don't want to be fixated with achieving a specific thing, but you want to push your cart in that direction, just like head that direction and have a general sense, but not, "I need to be that thing and that's what'll make me happy."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:26):
Exactly. I think that's exactly right.

Lenny (00:57:27):
Awesome. Okay. Final topic is from the recruiter perspective, what do you find recruiters do wrong most often or miss when they're trying to attract great product talent to a company?

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:38):
Yeah, so this is one I feel especially passionate about because I do think recruiters have a bit of a reputation, and I think that it's for some good reason. There's naturally people that forget that these are human beings that we're dealing with every single day that have lives, have families, have careers, or ambitions outside of their career.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:01):
So I think it's essential that you remember that this is another human being on the other end of things and that you should treat them with the same level of respect that you would expect to be treated.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:15):
This has become even more apparent now that I have gone through some of my own recruiting cycles where I was looking for different jobs, and a transactional recruiting call just will rub you so the wrong way and will make you want to put things on your resume like I just alluded to that say things like, "Whatever at Reddit," or what have you because you just don't want to deal with it.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:36):
And so I think you have to be a human, you have to start with a relationship, find common ground, build rapport, listen to people, like actually listen, and remember what they say. So if someone says, "I never want to do a crypto company," and I just am only shoving crypto companies down their throat, that's just insanely tone deaf. Or if they say, "I have this vest that I really want to be around for in May of next year," and I just keep hitting them up prior to that, that's just so not receptive to what they just said.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:12):
Things like that, make notes if easier, because we speak to so many people all day long so it's definitely not easy to do. But I'll have a note on my calendar that John Kim's vest just happened in March, and then I'll be like, "Oh, okay, might be a good time for me to catch up." I won't say, "Congrats on the recent vest." I'll say, "You want to grab a coffee, or do you want to catch up about this?" Or, "Hey, I saw that you were speaking at this conference, love what you spoke about with regards to this." You got to find ways to connect with people outside of just shoving them into a job.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:46):
And so I would say something that I've learned and become very good at is starting with a foundation of relationship building, gaining trust from people, because once you have that, then people will hear you out on jobs and people will listen to you and actually trust your advice from a career direction and perspective, but that takes time to build that, and it's definitely not going to be built by just chucking things at the wall and seeing what sticks with people and seeing where you can shove them temporarily. In fact, that will make them lose trust. And once you lose trust in a candidate, it's impossible to get it back.

Lenny (01:00:22):
It's interesting how one of the recurring themes of our chat so far is just play the long game in every way, which takes more time.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:28):
Yes.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Kind of sucks that you have to put in all this time ahead of time before you really need to get something done, but what you keep coming back to is just that's how you end up being successful as a recruiter, as a product leader, as a hiring manager, as a founder.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:39):
A million percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really easy when you've got a quota to hit and you've got people to provide for and a mortgage to just think about the numbers, but you have to play the long game because people aren't just a commodity. It's so much more.

Lenny (01:00:56):
And one of the perks of working with a recruiter is they have done that already for you, and so I was going to ask, when does it make sense for a founder to engage with a recruiter like yourself and when should they not?

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:08):
Engaging with recruiters sooner rather than later in a proactive way is always a positive thing. It's just sometimes companies aren't at the stage where they can necessarily hire a full-time recruiter because of resources and how expensive it is to bring in an exec recruiter.

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:26):
So having someone that you can bounce things off of in a more informal capacity, bringing in someone like a talent advisor that can help in a consultative way, those types of things, a million percent. Leaning into the venture firms that have backed you, which is a lot of what I'm doing right now, that is definitely areas in which early CEO founders should be leaning into that and trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. And then I would say typically series B feels ... series A, dependent on the check size, and then series B feels like a good time to bring in a couple key big players, if the company's well positioned to do so.

Lenny (01:02:06):
And bring in meaning full-time in-house recruiters or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:09):
Probably bring in a firm. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. I think you can bring in one or two recruiters in the early days like seed, if it makes sense for the company and they're growing quickly, but it's all kind of case to case.

Lenny (01:02:22):
The fact that you're kind of off the table for most founders now that you're at GC, which is a part ... And is that true? Like you basically at this point work for General Catalyst founders, is that correct?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:32):
I am supporting all of our GC founders in the consumer and crypto portfolio. That being said, I spend all day every single day networking and chatting with amazing entrepreneurs, people that could be founding a company down the road and need some advice, great people that want to help in an advising capacity. So it is, I would say, 50% networking, 50% actual parachuting into portfolio.

Lenny (01:03:00):
Got it. Okay.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:01):
Supporting them.

Lenny (01:03:01):
That's cool. I didn't know that part.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:03):
So outside of that, what do you suggest founders look for when they're looking for a recruiter, and the second to last question, what are signs that this is a good firm, a good recruiter? Just what should you be looking for when you're looking to hire a recruiter, either in house or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:15):
I think it's important to provide them with some direction and then see if they can recite it back to you. Tell them the types of things you're looking for and then say, "Did that resonate? Because I'd love to hear from you what you took away from that and what you think we should be looking for."

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:32):
And then kind of off the bat, ask them for a couple candidate ideas. Don't give them time to just go call other people. In real time, ask them for some candidate ideas. Where does their brain go? Who are people they would call tomorrow on this? The more that you can get that dynamic relationship formed before you even go to search, the more you can determine whether this is someone you want to calibrate with.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:54):
So yeah, I think just putting them on the spot a little bit and asking them to show their work rather than just sending over a deck of searches that could have been done by other partners or could have just been done by other people on their team. You want to actually understand who this person is. So that first question is testing their listening skills and their ability to actually hear what you're saying and what you're looking for, and then the second is, okay, now how quickly can we get calibrated on what this profile should look like.

Lenny (01:04:21):
Awesome. That is great advice. Very tactical. Any final words or wisdom before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lauren Ipsen (01:04:26):
This has been awesome, by the way. I think more generally, the advice is just treat people like human beings, build rapport, play the long game, and gain trust, and that takes time. And so those are the most important things from a recruiting standpoint, is being able to tap people and have them feel like you genuinely have their best interest at heart and that you care about their career and life outside their career. And so I think that's what makes for a really good recruiter.

Lenny (01:04:53):
Simple advice, but often forgotten and easy to overlook. Awesome. All right. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to give you six questions, whatever comes to mind, we'll go through them real fast. Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:08):
Okay. Yes. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:05:10):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:14):
The Power of Now and You Are Here.

Lenny (01:05:17):
Wow. Awesome. What are favorite other podcasts that you listen to other than this one?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:22):
I mean, there's tech ones, but Your Own Backyard because I went to Cal Poly, so that one hits a little close to home.

Lenny (01:05:28):
Wow, I haven't heard of that. Cool. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've watched that you've enjoyed?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:34):
Top Gun I've watched too many times and-

Lenny (01:05:39):
The new Top Gun.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:39):
Yeah. And then TV show. Oh, it's all trash reality, so I just can't tell you.

Lenny (01:05:45):
I get that. I understand. My wife has that and she can't tell anyone. Yeah.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:51):
That's my one secret.

Lenny (01:05:51):
All right. Okay, great. We'll move on, but that's great. What's a favorite ... Oh, this is interesting. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask or maybe you've seen someone ask?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:01):
I love the good strengths and weaknesses question. I think it's really good to see how people self-analyze themselves.

Lenny (01:06:06):
What do you look for in their answer that's the sign that it's well answered?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:10):
Honesty, authenticity. Can read right through a, "Work too hard," answer or a perfectionist type answer. What are your weaknesses? Let's talk about it.

Lenny (01:06:19):
For real.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:21):
So that one I think is always a really good test of character.

Lenny (01:06:24):
What are some favorite apps right now?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:27):
I've been playing around on BeReal. I mean, I love Spotify, it's straightforward. And then I've been on Strava, I've been running, so that are the-

Lenny (01:06:34):
That's a good combination of apps. That's like a full life.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:37):
Thank you. Thanks so much. Trying to be.

Lenny (01:06:41):
Final question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a leader and a thought leader influence type person?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:49):
My first boss out of college, Joe Suliman, is awesome. He's always taught me to lead with that relationship-based approach and it's really so easy to say that you do that, but then to actually do it and live it out for the people that work for you, as well as the people that are in industry and speak of you, is something else. And so he's always taught me to do that, and I just learned a ton from him and he's just incredibly smart and in tune with what's happening in industry and makes great stances and opinions on how to navigate those types of things. So, he's someone that I have an immense amount of respect for.

Lenny (01:07:24):
Sounds like an amazing person. Lauren, this was excellent. I feel like this is going to be useful to so many people, product managers, founders, other recruiters, all kinds of other people. Thank you so much for doing this and making the time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or maybe collaborate with you and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:07:44):
Yes, absolutely. And also, thank you. This has been so much fun. They can reach out to me on LinkedIn. I happen to be on that one quite a bit, so definitely can DM me there, can send me an email, and I can shoot you that over as well. And then the way they can be helpful is if there's people that they think the world of, shoot them my way. If they have questions around best ways to go through an interview process or how to navigate different things, please, by all means, a huge part of my job is trying to help people that are going through this for the first time. Happy to just be a sounding board or of help in any capacity.

Lenny (01:08:19):
So if you're an awesome product leader, you want to see what's out there, find Lauren on LinkedIn. Is that the best place to find you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:24):
That's perfect.

Lenny (01:08:25):
All right. Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:25):
Yep.

Lenny (01:08:25):
Thanks, Lauren.

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:26):
Thanks so much. Appreciate it.

# Inside OpenAI | Logan Kilpatrick (head of developer relations)

## Transcript

Logan Kilpatrick (00:00:00):
Finding people who are high agency and work with urgency, if I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to get 50 people's different consensus. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having, and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that... People just go and do it and solve the problem, and I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Today my guest is Logan Kilpatrick. Logan is head of developer relations at OpenAI, where he supports developers building on open AI's, APIs and ChatGPT. Before OpenAI, Logan was a machine learning engineer at Apple and advised NASA on their open source policy. If you can believe it, ChatGPT launched just over a year ago and transformed the way that we think about AI and what it means for our products and our lives. Logan has been at the front lines of this change, and every day is helping developers and companies figure out how to leverage these new AI superpowers.

(00:01:10):
In our conversation, we dig into examples of how people are using ChatGPT and the new GPTs and other open AI APIs in their work and their life. Logan shares some really interesting advice on how to get better at prompt engineering. We also get into how OpenAI operates internally, how they ship so quickly, and the two key attributes they look for in the people that they hire, plus, where Logan sees the biggest opportunities for new products and new startups building on their APIs.

(00:01:38):
We also get a little bit into the very dramatic weekend that OpenAI had with the board and Sam Altman and all of that, and so much more. A huge thank you to Dan Shipper and Dennis Ing for some great questions, suggestions. With that, I bring you Logan Kilpatrick after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:56):

Logan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:03:55):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:03:57):
I want to start with the elephant in the room, which I think the elephant is actually leaving the room because I think this is months ago at this point, but I'm still just really curious. What was it like on the inside of OpenAI during the very dramatic weekend with the board and Sam and all those things? What was it like? And is there a story maybe you could share that maybe people haven't heard about what it was like on the inside, what was going on?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:04:20):
Yeah, it was definitely a very stressful Thanksgiving week. I think in broad context, OpenAI had been pushing for a really long time, since ChatGPT came out, and that was supposed to be one of the first weeks that the whole company had taken time away to actually reset and have a break. So very selfishly, I was super excited to spend time with my family, all that stuff. And then, yeah, Friday afternoon we got the message that all of the changes were happening, and I think it was super shocking because I think, and this is a perspective a lot of folks share, everybody had and continues to have such deep trust in Sam and Greg and our leadership team that it was just very surprising. And we're also a very, as far as company cultures go, very transparent and very open. So when there's problems or there's things going on, we tend to hear about them. And again, it was the first time that a lot of us had heard some of the things that were happening between the board and the leadership team, so very, very surprising.

(00:05:20):
I think my being someone who's not based in San Francisco, I was, again, very selfishly kind of happy that it happened over the Thanksgiving break because a lot of folks actually had gone home to different places. So it felt like I had a little bit of comfort knowing I wasn't the only one not in San Francisco, because everybody was meeting up in person to do a bunch of stuff and be together during that time. So it was nice to know that there was a few other folks who were sort of out of the loop with me.

(00:05:51):
I think the thing that surprised me the most was just how quickly everybody got back to business. I flew to San Francisco the next week after Thanksgiving, which I wasn't planning to do, to deal with the team in person and seeing, literally Monday morning, I was walking into the office being, like expecting, I don't know, something weird to be going on or happening. And really it was like people laser focused and back to work, and I think that speaks to the caliber of our team and everybody who's just so excited about building towards the mission that we're building towards. So I think that was, yeah, that was the most surprising thing of the whole incident. I think a lot of companies would've had the potential to truly be derailed for some non-trivial amount of time by this, and everybody was just right back to it, which I love.

Lenny (00:06:40):
I feel like it also maybe brought the team closer together. It feels like it was this kind of traumatic experience that may bring folks together because it was something they all shared. Is there anything along those lines that's like, "Wow, things are a little different now?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:06:52):
One of my takeaways was I'm actually very grateful that this happened when it happened. I think today the stakes are... They're still relatively high. People have built their businesses on top of OpenAI. We have tons of customers who love ChatGPT, so if something bad happens to us, we definitely impact our customers. But on the world scale, somebody else will build a model if OpenAI disappeared and continue towards this progress of general intelligence. I think fast-forward five or 10 years, if something like this would've happened and we hadn't gone through the hopeful upcoming work transformation and all those changes that are going to happen, I think it would've been a little bit, or potentially much worse, of an outcome. So I'm glad that things happened when the stakes are a little bit lower.

(00:07:39):
And I totally agree with you. It's like the team has been growing so rapidly over the last year since I joined. It's been crazy to think about how many new folks there are, and I really think that this really brought people together because most folks, historically, many of the folks when I joined, what kind of banded us all together was the launch of ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-4, and for folks who weren't around for some of those launches, it was perhaps step day. For folks who are on for dev day, it was probably this event. So I think we've had these events that have really brought the company together cross-functionally, so hopefully all the future ones will be really exciting things like GPT five, whenever that comes, and stuff like that.

Lenny (00:08:20):
Awesome. We're going to talk about GPT-5. Going in a totally different direction, what is the most mind-blowing or surprising thing that you've seen AI do recently?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:31):
The things that are getting me most excited are these new interfaces around AI, like the Rabbit R-1. I don't know if you've seen that, but consumer hardware device, this company called TL Draw. I don't know if you've seen TL Draw.

Lenny (00:08:44):
I think. You sketch something and then it makes it as a website?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:48):
And that's only a small piece of what TL Draw is actually working on, but there's all of these new interfaces to interact with AI, and I think I was having a conversation with the TL Draw folks a couple of days ago, really blows my mind to think about how chat is the predominant way that folks are using AI today. And I actually think, and this is my bulk case for the folks at TL Draw, I'm super excited for them to build what they're building, but they're sort of building this infinite canvas experience and you can imagine how, as you're interacting with an AI on a daily basis, you might want to jump over to your infinite canvas, which the AI has filled in all the details and you might see a reference to a file and to a video and all of these different things.

(00:09:30):
And it's such a cool way. It actually makes a lot more sense for us as humans to see stuff in that type of format than, I think, just listing out a bunch of stuff in chat. So I'm really, really excited to see more people. I think 2024 is the year of multimodal AI, but it's also the year that people really push the boundaries of some of these new UX paradigms around AI.

Lenny (00:09:53):
It's funny. I feel like Chatbots, as a PM for many years, it feels like every brainstorming session we had about new features, it's like, "Hey, we should have built a Chatbot to solve this problem." It's like the perennial like, "Oh, Chatbot," or, "Someone's going to suggest we do a Chatbot," and now they're actually useful and working and everyone's building Chatbots, a lot of them based on OpenAI APIs.

(00:10:12):
There's not really a question there, but maybe the question, I was going to get to this later, is just when people are thinking about building a product like, say, TL Draw, what should they think about? Where OpenAI is not going to go versus here's what OpenAI is going to do for us. We shouldn't worry about them building a version of TL Draw in the future. What's the way to think about where you won't be disrupted essentially by OpenAI, knowing also they may change their mind?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:10:36):
That's a great question. I think we're deeply focused on these very, very general use cases like the general reasoning capabilities, the general coding, the general writing abilities. I think where you start to get into some of these very vertical applications... And I think a great example of this is actually Harvey. I don't know if you've seen Harvey, but it's this legal AI use case where they're building custom models and tools to help lawyers and people at legal firms and stuff like that. And that's a great example of our models are probably never going to be as capable as some of the things that Harvey's doing because our goal and our mission is really to solve this very general use case and then people can do things like fine-tuning and build all their own custom UI and product features on top of that.

(00:11:17):
I have a lot of empathy and a lot of excitement for people who are building these very general products today. I talk to a lot of developers who are building just general purpose assistants and general purpose agents and stuff like that. I think it's cool and it's a good idea. I think the challenge for them is they are going to end up directly competing against us in those spaces and I think there's enough room for a lot of people to be successful, but to me you shouldn't be surprised when we end up launching some general purpose agent product because, again, we're sort of building that with GPTs today and versus we're not going to launch some of these varied verticalized products. We're not going to launch an AI sales agent. That's just not what we're building towards. And companies who are and have some domain specific knowledge and they're really excited about that problem space, they can go into that and leverage our models and end up continuing to be on the cutting edge without having to do all that R&D effort themselves.

Lenny (00:12:16):
Got it. So the advice I'm hearing is get specific about use cases, and that could be either models that are tuned to be especially useful for a use case like sales or make an interface or experience solving a more specific problem.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:12:30):
And I think if you're going to try and solve this very general, if you're going to try to build the next general assistant to compete with something like ChatGPT, it has to be so radically different. People have to really be like, "Wow, this is solving these 10 problems that I have with ChatGPT, and therefore I'm going to go and try your new thing." Otherwise we're just putting a ton of engineering efforts and research effort into making that an incredible product, and it's just going to be the normal challenges of building companies. It's just hard to compete against something like that.

Lenny (00:12:59):
Awesome. Okay, that's great. I was going to get to that later, but I'm glad we touched on that. I imagine that's on the minds of many developers and founders. Kind of along the same lines, there's a lot of talk about how ChatGPT and GPTs and many of the tools you guys offer are going to make a company much more efficient. They don't need as many engineers, data scientists, PMs, things like that, but I think it's also hard for companies to think about what can we actually do to make our company more efficient. I'm curious if there's any examples that you can share of how companies have taken built a, say, a GPT internally to do something so that they don't have to spend engineering hours on it or generally just used OpenAI tooling to make their business internally more efficient?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's a great question. I wonder if you can put this in the show notes or something like that, but there's a really great Harvard Business School study about... And I forgot which consulting firm they did it with. Maybe it was like Boston Consulting or something like that, but it might've been one of the other ones. And they talk about the order of magnitude of efficiency gain for those folks who are using AI tools, I think it was chat GPT specifically in those use cases that they were using, comparatively against folks who aren't using AI. I'm really excited, also, just as just more time passes between the release of this technology, for us to get more empirical studies. I feel just for myself, as somebody who's an engineer today, I use ChatGPT and I can ship things way faster than I would be able to.

(00:14:26):
I don't have any good metrics for myself to put a specific number on it, but I'm guessing people are working on those studies right now. I think engineering is actually one of the highest leverage things that you could be using AI to do today and really unlocking, probably on the order of at least a 50% improvement, especially for some of the lower hanging fruit software engineering tasks. The models are just so capable at doing that work. And it's crazy to think... And I'm guessing, actually, GitHub probably has a bunch of really great studies they publish around copilots and you could use those as an analogy for what people are getting from ChatGPT as well. But those are probably the highest leverage things.

(00:15:07):
I think now with GPTs, people are able to go in and solve some of these more tactical problems. I think one of the general challenges with ChatGPT is it gives a decent answer for a lot of different use cases, but oftentimes it's not particular enough to the voice of your company or the nuance of the work that you're doing. And I think now with GPTs and people who are using the teams in ChatGPT and Enterprise in ChatGPT, they can actually build those things, incorporate the nuance of their own company, and make solving those tasks much, much more domain specific. So we literally just launched GPTs a couple of months ago, so I don't think there's been any good public success stories, but I'm guessing that success is happening right now at companies, and hopefully we'll hear more about that in the months to come as folks get super excited about sharing those case studies.

Lenny (00:15:58):
I'll share an example. So I have this good friend, his name's Dennis Yang, he works at Chime, and he told me about two things that they're doing at Chime that seem to be providing value. One is he built a GPT that helps write ads for Facebook and Google just gives you ideas for ads to run, and so that takes a little load off the marketing team or the growth team. And then he built another GPT that delivers experiment results, kind of like a data scientist, with here's the result of this experiment. And then you could talk to it and ask for like, "Hey, how much longer do you think we should run this for," or, "What might this imply about our product," and things like that. And I think it's really-

Logan Kilpatrick (00:15:58):
I love that.

Lenny (00:16:35):
Like you said. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just things you've heard people do just like, "Wow, that was a really smart way of... " So I get there's engineering, co-piloting type tooling. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just to give people a little inspiration of like, "Wow, that's an interesting way I should be thinking about using some of these tools."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:16:50):
I've seen some interesting GPTs around the planning use cases, like you want to do OKR planning for your team or something like that. I just actually saw somebody tweet it literally yesterday. I've seen some cool venture capital ones of doing diligence on a deal flow, which is kind of interesting, and getting some different perspectives. I think all of those horizontal use cases where you can bring in a different personality and get perspective on different things I think is really cool. I've personally used a GPT, the private GPT that I use myself that helps with some of the planning stuff for different quarters, and just making sure that I'm being consistent in how I'm framing things like driving back to individual metrics, stuff that, when people do planning, they often miss in our data, and then it's been super helpful for me to have a GPT to force me to think about some of those things.

Lenny (00:17:43):
Wait, can you talk more about this? What does this GPT do for you and what do you feed it?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:17:48):
Yeah, I forgot what article I saw online, but it was some article that was talking about what are the best ways to set yourself up for success in planning. And I took a bunch of the... I'll see if I can make it public after this and send you a link, but took a bunch of the examples from that and went in and put some of those suggestions into the GPT, and then now when I do any of my planning of I want to build this thing, I put it through and have it generate a timeline, generate all the specifics of what are the metrics and success that I'm looking for, who might be some important cross-functional stakeholders to include in the planning process, all that stuff, and it's been helpful.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Wow, that is very cool. That would be awesome if you made it public. And if you do, we'll link to it and we'll make it the number one most popular GPT in the store.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:18:35):
I love it.

Lenny (00:18:35):
Going in a slightly different direction, there's this whole genre of prompt engineering. It feels like it's one of these really emerging skills. I actually saw a startup hiring a prompt engineer, one of the startups I've invested in, and I think that's going to blow a lot of people's minds that there's this new job that's emerging. And I know the idea is this won't last forever, that in theory AI will be so smart you don't need to really think about how to be smart about asking it for things you need it to do. But can you just describe this idea of what is prompt engineering, this term that people might be hearing? And then even more interestingly, just what advice do you have for people to get better at writing prompts for, say, ChatGPT or through the API in general?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:19:13):
Yeah, this is such an interesting space, and I think it's another space where I'm excited for people to do more scientific empirical studies about, because there's so much gut feeling, best practices that maybe aren't actually true in a certain way. I think the reason that prompt engineering exists and comes up at all is because the models are so inclined, because of the way that they're trained, to give you just an answer to the question that you ask. Crap in crap out. If you ask a pretty basic question, you're going to get a pretty basic response. And actually the same thing is true for humans, and you can think of a great example of this. When I go to another human and I ask, "How's your day going," they say, "It's going pretty good."

(00:19:53):
Literally, absolutely zero detail, no nuance, not very interesting at all versus, again, if you have some context with a person, if you have a personal relationship with them and I ask you, "Hey Lenny, how's your day going? How did the last podcast go," et cetera, et cetera, you just have a little bit more context and agency to go and answer my question. I think this is prompt engineering.

(00:20:13):
My whole position on this is prompt engineering is a very human thing. When we want to get some value out of a human, we do this prompt engineering. We try to effectively communicate with that human in order to get the best output. And the same thing is true of models. And I think it's like, again, because we're using a system that appears to be really smart, we assume that it has all this context, but it's really like imagine a human level intelligence but literally no context. It has no idea what you're going to ask it. It's never met you before. It has no idea who you are, what you do, what your goals are. And it's the reason that you get super generic responses sometimes is because people forget they need to put that context in the model.

(00:20:57):
So I think the thing that is going to help solve this problem, and we already kind of do this in the context of Dali, so when you go to the image generation model that we have, Dali, and you say, "I want a picture of a turtle," what it does is it actually takes that description. It says, "I want a picture of a turtle," and it changes it into this high fidelity, like generate a picture of a turtle with a shell, with a green background and lily pads in the water and all this other. It adds all this fidelity because that's the way that the model is trained. It's trained on examples with super high fidelity. This will happen with text models.

(00:21:35):
You can imagine a world where you go into ChatGPT and you say, "Write me a blog post about AI." It automatically will go and be like, "Let me generate a much higher fidelity description of what this person really wants, which is generate me a blog post about AI that talks about the trade-offs between these different techniques and some example use cases and references some of the latest papers," and it does all that for you, and then you at the user will hopefully be able to be like, "Yep, this is kind of what I wanted. Let me edit this. Let me edit this here."

(00:22:02):
And again, the inherent problem is we're lazy as humans. We don't want to type all... We don't really want to type what we mean, and I think AI systems are actually going to help solve some of that problem.

Lenny (00:22:12):
So until that day, what can people do better when they're prompting, say ChatGPT? And I'll give you an example. Tim Ferris suggested this really good idea that I've been stealing, which is when you're preparing for an interview, you go to chat GPT. And so I did this for you. I was like, "Hey, I'm interviewing Logan Kilpatrick, he is head of developer relations at OpenAI, on my podcast. Give me 10 questions to ask him in the style of Tyler Cowen," who I think is the best interviewer. He is so good at just very pointed original questions. So what advice would you have for me to improve on that prompt to have better results? The questions were fine. They're great. They're interesting enough, but they weren't like, "Holy, these are incredible." So I guess what advice would you give me in that example?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:22:57):
Yeah, that's a great example where thinking in context of who it is that you're asking questions about. I'm probably not somebody who has enough information about me on the internet where the model actually has been trained and knows the nuances of my background. I think there's probably much more famous guests where it might be that there's enough context on the internet to answer the questions. You actually have to do some of that work. You need to, say if you're using browse with Bing, for example, you could say, "Here's a link to Logan's blog and some of the things that he's talked about. Here's a link to his Twitter. Go through some of his tweets, go through some of his blogs and see what his interesting perspectives are that we might want to surface on the blog," or something like that.

(00:23:36):
It's, again, giving the model enough context to answer the question. I think, again, that prompt actually might work really well for somebody who has it, if you were interviewing Tom Cruise or something like that, somebody who has a lot of information about them on the internet. It probably works a little bit better.

Lenny (00:23:52):
So the advice there is just give more context. It doesn't tell you, "Hey, I don't actually know that much about Logan, so give me some more information." It's just like, "Here you go. Here's a bunch of good questions."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:00):
Exactly. It wants to. It so deeply wants to answer your question. It doesn't care that it doesn't have enough context. It's the most eager person in the world you could imagine to answer the question, and without that context it's just hard to do, to give anything a value. If we got t-shirts printed, they should say, "Context is all you need. Context is the only thing that matters." It's such an important piece of getting a language model to do anything for you.

Lenny (00:24:26):
Any other tips? Just as people are sitting there, maybe they have ChatGPT open right now as they're crafting a prompt, is there anything else that you'd say would help them have better results?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:37):
We actually have a prompt engineering guide, which folks should go and check out. It has some of the examples. It depends on the order of magnitude of how much performance increase you can get. There's a lot of really small silly things, like adding a smiley face, increases the performance of the model. I'm sure folks have seen a lot of these silly examples, but telling the model to take a break and then answer the question, all these kinds of things. And again, if you think about it, it's because the corpus of information that's trained these models is the same things that humans have sent back and forth to each other. So you telling a human, "When I go take a break and then I come back to work, I'm fresher and I'm able to answer questions better and do work better," so very similar things are true for these models. And again, when I see a smiley face at the end of someone's message, I feel empowered that this is going to be a positive interaction and I should be more inclined to give them a great answer and spend more effort on the thing that they asked me for.

Lenny (00:25:34):
Wow, wait. So that's a real thing. If you had a smiley face, it might give you better results.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:25:39):
Again, it's like the challenge with all this stuff is it's very nuanced and it's also it's a small jump in performance. You could imagine on the order of one or 2%, which for a few sentence answer might not even be a discernible difference. Again, if you're generating an entire saga of texts, the smiley face could actually make a material difference for you, but for something small and textual it might not.

Lenny (00:26:03):
Okay, good tip. Amazing. Okay, we've talked about GPTs I think maybe might be helpful to describe what is this new thing that you guys launched, GPTs, and I'm curious just how it's going. This is a really big change and element of OpenAI now with this idea that you could build your own mini, and I'm almost explaining it, your mini open ChatGPT and then people can... I think you can pay for it. You can charge for your own GPT or is it all free right now?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:29):
It's ll free right now. It's all free.

Lenny (00:26:31):
Okay. In the future I imagine people will be able to charge. So there's this whole store now. Basically it's the whole app store that you guys have launched. How's it going? What's happening? What surprised you there? What should people know?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:42):
Yeah, it's going great, and again, historically the thing that you would have to do, let's say for example, you have a really cool ChatGPT use case, what you would have to do to share it with somebody else is actually go in and start the conversation with the model, prompt it to do the things that you wanted to, and then you would share that link with somebody else before the action has actually happened and be like, here now you can essentially finish this conversation with ChatGPT that I started.

(00:27:08):
So GPT kind of changes this where you take all that important context, you put it into the model to begin with, and then people can go and chat with essentially a custom version of ChatGPT. And the thing that's really interesting is you can upload files, you can give it custom instructions, you can add all these different tools. Like a code interpreter is built in, which allows you to do math. Essentially you have browsing built in, image generation built in. You can also, for more advanced use cases if you're a developer, you can connect it to external APIs so you can connect it to the Notion API or Gmail or all these different things, and have it actually take actions on your behalf.

(00:27:44):
So there's so many cool things that people are unlocking. And what's been most exciting to me, actually, is the non-developer persona is now empowered to go and solve these really, really, really more challenging problems by giving the model enough context on what that problem is to be able to solve it. Going back to context is all you need, this is very true in the context of GPTs, and if you give it enough context, you can solve much more interesting problems.

(00:28:11):
There's so many things that I'm excited about with this. I think monetization, when it comes to the store later this quarter, I think is going to be extremely exciting when people can get paid based on who's using their GPT. That's going to be a huge unlock and open a lot of people's eyes to the opportunity here. I also think continuing to push on making more capabilities accessible to GPTs for people who can't code is really exciting. Even for me as someone who is a software engineer, it's not super easy to connect the Notion API or the Gmail API to my GPT, and really I'd love to just be able to one click sign in with Gmail and then all of a sudden it's like my Gmail is accessible, or someone else can sign in with their Gmail and make it accessible. So I think over time all those types of things will come, but today it's really custom prompts is essentially one of the biggest value adds with GPTs.

Lenny (00:29:03):
Awesome. I have it pulled up here on different monitor and Canva has the top GPT currently, and I was trying to play with it as you're chatting just to see. I was going to make a big banner that said, "It's the context stupid," and it doesn't. I'm not doing something right, but I'm not paying that much attention to it because we're talking, but this is very cool. Just maybe a final question there. Is there a GPT that you saw someone built that was like, "Wow, that's amazing. That's so cool," something that surprised you? And I'll share one that was very cool, but is there anything that comes to mind when I ask that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:29:33):
I think my instinct is the Zapier. All of the stuff that Zapier has done with GPTs is the most useful stuff that you could imagine. You can go so far with what... And I don't know how it's packaged for Zapier's GPT right now, but you can actually, as a third party developer, integrate Zapier without knowing how to code into your GPT. So they're pushing a lot of this stuff, and then basically all 5,000 connections that are possible with Zapier today, you can bring into your GPT and essentially enable it to do anything. So I'm incredibly excited for Zapier and for people who are building with them so many things that you can unlock using that platform. So I think that's probably the most exciting thing to me for people who aren't developers.

Lenny (00:30:20):
Awesome. Zapier's always in there, getting in there connecting things.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:23):
Yeah, they're great.

Lenny (00:30:25):
So the one that I had in mind, so I had a buddy of mine, [inaudible 00:30:28], who's the CEO of a company called Runway built this thing called Universal Primer which helps you learn. It's described as, "Learn everything about anything," and basically, I think, it's kind of this Socratic method of helping you learn stuff. So it's like, "Explain how transformers work in LMs," and then it just kind goes through stuff and then asks you questions, I think, and helps you learn new concepts. And I think it's the number two education GPT.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:53):
I love that. [inaudible 00:30:53] is incredible, so...

Lenny (00:30:54):
Yes, it's true. Let me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished, on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why Product Four teams such as Atlassian, Carta and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails and documentation.

(00:31:23):
But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2X higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale.

(00:31:50):
Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.

(00:32:11):
I want to talk about just what it's like to work at OpenAI and how the product team operates and how the company operates. So you worked at... Your two previous companies were Apple and NASA, which are not known for moving fast. And now you're at OpenAI, which is known for moving very fast, maybe too fast for some people's taste, as we saw it with the whole board thing. And so what I'm curious is just what is it that OpenAI does so well that allows them to build and ship so quickly and at such a high bar? Is there a process or a way of working that you've seen that you think other companies should try to move more quickly and ship better stuff?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:32:48):
Yeah, there's so many interesting trade-offs and all of this tension around how quickly companies can move. I think for us, again, if you think about Apple as an example, if you think about NASA as an example, just older institutions, lots of... Over time, the tendency is things slow down. There's additional checks and balances that are put in place, which drags things down a little bit. So we're young and a new company, so we don't have a lot of that institutional legacy barriers that have been put in place.

(00:33:18):
I think the biggest thing, and there's a good Sam tweet somewhere in the ether about this from, I think, 2022 or something like that, but finding people who are high agency and work with urgency is one of the most... If I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to either get 50 people's different consensus, because you have people who you trust with high agency and they can just go and do the thing, I think, is one of the most... It is the most important thing, I'm pretty sure, if you were to distill it down.

(00:34:04):
And I see this in folks that I work with. Folks are so high agency. They see a problem and they go and tackle it. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that I think traditional companies are stuck behind because they're like, "Oh, let's check with all these seven different departments to try to get feedback on this." People just go and do it and solve the problem. And I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:34:35):
That is so cool. I really like these two characteristics because I haven't heard this before. Those are the two, maybe the two most important things you guys look for, high agency, high urgency. To give people a clear sense of what these actually look like when you're hiring, you shared maybe this example of customer service. Someone's hearing a bug and then going to fix it. Is there anything else that can illustrate what that looks like, high agency? And then a similar question on urgency other than just move, move, move, ship, ship, ship.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:35:01):
I think the assistants API that we released for dev day, we continue to get this feedback from developers that people wanted these higher levels of abstraction on top of our existing APIs, and a bunch of folks on the team just came together and were like, "Hey, let's put together what the plan would look like to build something like this," And then very quickly came together and actually built the actual API that now powers so many people's assistant applications that are out there. And I think that's a great example of it wasn't this top down, oh, someone's sitting there being like, "Oh, let's do these five things," and then like, "Okay, team, go and do that." It's like people really seeing these problems that are coming up and knowing that they can come together as a team and solve these problems really quickly. And I think the assistants API, and there's like 1,001 other examples of teams taking agency and doing this, but I think that's a great one at the top of my head

Lenny (00:35:55):
That makes me want to ask. Just how does planning work at OpenAI? So in this example is just like, "Hey, we think we need to build this. Let's just go and build it." I imagine there's still a roadmap and priorities and goals and things that that team had. How does road mapping and prioritization and all of that generally work to allow for something like that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:36:14):
I think this is one of the more challenging pieces at OpenAI. There's so many. Everyone wants everything from us, and today, especially, in the world of ChatGPT and how large and well-used our API is, people will just come to us and say, "Hey, we want all of these things." I think there's a bunch of core guiding principles that we look at. One, going back to the mission, is this actually going to help us get to AGI? So there's a huge focus on there's this potential shiny reward right in front of us, which is optimize user engagement, or whatever it is. And is that really the thing? Maybe the answer is yes. Maybe that is what is going to help us get to AGI sooner, but looking at it through that lens I think is always the first step of deciding any of these problems.

(00:37:03):
I think, on the developer side, there's also these core tenets of reliability like, "Hey, it would be awesome if we had additional APIs that did all these cool things like new endpoints, new modalities, new abstractions, but are we giving customers a robust and reliable experience on our API?" And that's often the first question. And I think there have been times where we've fallen short on that, and there was a bunch of other things that we've been thinking about doing and really bringing the focus and priority back to that reliability piece because, at the end of the day, nobody cares if you have something great if they can't use it robust and reliably.

(00:37:37):
So there's these core tenets. And I think, again, we have very, other than all the principles about how we're making the decision, I think the actual planning process is pretty standard. We come together. There's H1 Q1 goals. We all sprint on those. I think the real interesting thing is how stuff changes over time. You think we're going to do these very high level things and new models, new modalities, whatever it is. And then as time goes on, there's all of this turmoil and change, and it's interesting to have mechanisms to be like, "Hey, how do we update our understanding of the world and our goals as everything the ground changes underneath of us as is happening in the craziness of the AI space today?"

Lenny (00:38:22):
It's interesting that it sounds a lot like most other companies. There's H1 planning. There's Q1 planning. Are there metrics and goals like that that you guys have OKRs or anything like that? Or is it just, Here we're going to launch these products?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:38:33):
I think it's much higher level. I actually don't think OpenAI is a big OKR company. I don't think teams do OKRs today and I don't have a good understanding of why that's the case, whether or not. I don't even know if OKRs are still the industry. You're probably talking to a lot more folks about who are making those decisions. So I'm curious. Is that something that you're seeing from folks? Is it still common for people to do OKRs?

Lenny (00:38:55):
Yeah, absolutely. Many companies use OKRs, love OKRs. Many companies hate OKRs. I'm not surprised that OpenAI is not an OKR driven company. Along those lines, I don't know how much you can share about all this stuff, but how do you measure success for things that you launch? I know there's this ultimate goal, AGI. Is there some way to track we're getting closer? What else do you guys look at when you launch, say DPT Store or assistants or anything that's like, "Cool, that was exactly what we're hoping for." Is it just adoption?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:39:20):
Yeah, adoption is a great one. I think there's a bunch of metrics around revenue, number of developers that are building on our platform, all those things. And a lot of these, and I don't want to dive... I'll let Sam or someone else on our leadership team go more into details, but I think a lot of these are actual abstractions towards something else. Even if revenue is a goal, it's like revenue is not actually the goal. Revenue is a proxy for getting more compute, which is then actually what helps us get towards getting more GPUs so that we can train better models and actually get to the goal. So there's all these intermediate layers where even if we say something is the goal, and you hear that in a vacuum and you're like, "Oh, well OpenAI just wants to make money," and it's like, "Well, really money is the mechanism to get better models so that we can achieve our mission." And I think there's a bunch of interesting angles like that as well.

Lenny (00:40:12):
I don't know if I've heard of a more ambitious vision for a company, to build artificial general intelligence. I love that. I imagine many companies are like, "What's our version of that?" Before we leave this topic, is there anything else that you've seen OpenAI do really well that allows it to move this fast and be this successful? You talked about hiring people with higher agency and high urgency. Is there anything else that's just like, "Oh wow, that's a really good way of operating?" I imagine part of it's just hiring incredibly smart people. I think that's probably an unsaid thing, but yeah, anything else?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:40:45):
I think there's a non-trivial benefit to using Slack, and I think maybe that's controversial and maybe some people don't like Slack, but OpenAI has such a slack heavy culture and it really... The instantaneous real time communication on Slack is so crucial. And I just love being able to tag in different people from different teams and get everybody coalesced. So everybody is always on Slack, so even if you're remote or you're on a different team or in a different office, so much of the company culture is ingrained in Slack, and it allows us to really quickly coordinate where it's actually faster to send someone a Slack message sometimes than it would be to walk over to their desk because they're on Slack and they're going to be using it.

(00:41:27):
And I saw, if you saw, the recent Sam and Bill Gates interview, but Sam was talking about how Slack is his number one most used app on his phone and, "I don't even look at the time thing on my phone anymore because I don't want to know how long I'm using Slack," but I'm sure the Salesforce people are looking at the numbers and they're like, "This is exactly what we wanted."

Lenny (00:41:46):
I also love Slack. I'm a big promoter Slack. I think there's a lot of Slack hate, but such a good product. I've tried so many alternatives and nothing compares. I think what's interesting about Slack for you guys is one of the... You don't know if someone in there is just an AGI, that is not actually a person that's just there working at the company.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:01):
I know there are real people. There is no AGIs yet. But I think, yeah, even Slack is building a bunch of really cool AI tools, which I'm excited to... And that's why there's so much cool AI progress. And at the end of the day, it's so exciting, from being a consumer of all these new AI products. Google's a great example. I'm so happy that Google is doing really cool AI stuff because I'm a Google Docs customer and I love using Google Docs. I like a bunch of their other products, and it's awesome that people are building such useful things around these models.

Lenny (00:42:33):
How big is the OpenAI team at this point, whatever you can share? Just to give people a sense of the scale.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:38):
Yeah, I think the last public number was something around like 750 near the end of last year, 780 or something like that near the end of last year. And we're still growing so quickly, so I won't be the messenger to share the specific updated numbers, but the team is growing like crazy and we're also hiring across all of our engineering teams and PM teams, so folks who are interested, would love to hear from folks who are curious about joining.

Lenny (00:43:03):
Maybe one last question here. So you're growing, maybe getting to 1,000 people, clearly still very innovative and moving incredibly fast. Is there anything you've seen about what OpenAI does well to enable innovation and not slow down new big ideas?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:43:19):
Yeah, there's a couple of things, one of which is the actual research team, who seed most of the innovation that happens at OpenAI, is intentionally small. Most of the growth that OpenAI has seen is around our customer facing roles, our engineering roles to provide the infrastructure for ChatGPT and things like that. The research team is, again, intentionally kept small and there's all of this talk. And it's really interesting. I just saw this thread from one of our research folks who was talking about how in a world where you're constrained by the amount of GPU capacity that you have as a researcher, which is the case for open AI researchers, but also researchers everywhere else, each new researcher that you add is actually a net productivity loss for the research group unless that person is up-leveling everyone else in such a profound way that it increases the efficiency.

(00:44:12):
If you just add somebody who's going to go and tackle some completely different research direction, you now have to share your GPUs with that person and everyone else is now slower on their experiments. So it's a really interesting trade-off that research folks have that I don't think product folks... If I add another engineer to our API team or to some of the ChatGPT teams, you can actually write more code and do more. And that's actually a net beneficial improvement for everybody. And that's always not the case in the case of researchers, which is interesting, in A GPU constrained world, which hopefully we won't always be in.

Lenny (00:44:46):
I want to zoom out a bit and then there's going to be a couple follow-up questions here. Where are things heading with OpenAI? What's in the near future of what people should expect from the tools that you guys are going to have in launch?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:44:58):
Yeah, new modalities. I think ChatGPT continuing to push all of the different experiences that are going to be possible. Today, ChatGPT is really just text in, text out or, I guess three months ago, it was just text in, text out. We started to change that with now you can do the voice mode and now you can generate images and now you can take pictures. So I think continuing to expand the way in which you interface with AI through ChatGPT is coming.

(00:45:24):
I think GPTs is our first step towards the agent future. Again, today when you use A GPT, it's really you send a message, you get an answer back almost right away, and that's kind of the end of your interaction. I think as GPTs continue to get more robust, you'll actually be able to say, "Hey, go and do this thing and just let me know when you're done. I don't need the answer right now. I want you to really spend time and be thoughtful about this."

(00:45:48):
And again, if you think back to all these human analogies, that's what we do as humans. I don't expect somebody, when I ask them to do something meaningful for me, to do it right away and give me the answer back right away. So I think pushing more towards those experiences is what is going to unlock so much more value for people.

(00:46:06):
And I think the last thing is GPTs as this mechanism to get the next few hundred million people into ChatGPT and into AI. So I think if you've had conversations with people who aren't close to the AI space, oftentimes you talk about, even if they've heard of ChatGPT... A lot of people haven't heard of ChatGPT, but if they have, they show up in ChatGPT and they're like, "I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with this blank slate. I can kind of do anything. It's not super clear how this solves my specific problem."

(00:46:35):
But I think the cool thing about GPTs is you can package down like, "Here's this one very specific problem that AI can solve for you and do it really well," and I can share that experience with you and now you can go and try that GPT, have it actually solve the problem and be like, "Wow, it did this thing for me. I should probably spend the time to investigate these five other problems that I have to see if AI can also be a solution to those." So I think so many more people are going to come online and start using these tools because very narrow vertical tools are what's going to be a huge unlock for them.

Lenny (00:47:07):
So in that last case, a classic horizontal product problem where it does so many things and people don't know what exactly it should do for them. So that makes a ton of sense. Just being a lot more template oriented, use case specific, helping people onboard makes tons of sense. A common problem for so many SaaS products out there. The other ones you mentioned, which was really interesting, basically more interfaces to more easily interact with OpenAI voice. You mentioned audio and things like that. That makes tons of sense. And then this agents piece where the idea is, instead of just it's a chat, it's like, "Hey, go do this thing for me."

(00:47:42):
Kind of along those lines, GPT-5, we touched on this a bit. There's a lot of speculation about the much better version. People just have these wild expectations, I think, for where GPT is going. GPT-5 is going to solve all the world's problems. I know you're not going to tell me when it's launching and what it's going to do, but I heard from a friend that there's kind of this tip that when you're building products today, you should build towards a GPT-5 future, not based on limitations of GPT-4 today. So to help people do that, what should people think about that might be better in a world of GPT-5? Is it just faster? It's just smarter? Is there anything else that might be like, "Oh wow, I should really rethink how I'm approaching my product?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:48:22):
If folks have looked through the GPT-4 technical report that we released back in March when GPT-4 came out, GPT-4 was the first model that we trained where we could reliably predict the capabilities of that model beforehand based on the amount of computes that we were going to put into it. We did a scientific study to show like, "Hey, this is what we predicted and here is what the actual outcome was." So it'll be, one I think, just as somebody who's interested in technology, but interesting to see does that continue to hold for GPT-5, and hopefully we'll some of that information whenever that model comes out.

(00:48:56):
I also think you can probably draw a few observations. One of them, which is GPT-4 came out. The consensus from the world is, "Everything is different. All of a sudden everything is different. This changes the world. This changes everything." And then slowly but surely, we come back to reality of like, "This is a really effective tool and it's going to help solve my problems more effectively."

(00:49:21):
And I think that is the, undoubtedly, the lens in which people should look at all of these model advancements, like GPT-5 is surely going to be extremely useful and solve some whole new echelon of problems. Hopefully it'll be faster. Hopefully It'll be better in all these ways, but fundamentally, the same problems that exists in the world are still going to be the same problems. You now just have a better tool to solve those problems.

(00:49:44):
And I think going back to vertical use cases, I think people who are solving very specific use cases are just now going to be able to do that much more effectively. I don't think that's going to... People have these unrealistic expectations that GPT-5 is going to be doing back flips in the background in my bedroom while it also writes all my code for me and talks on the phone with my mom or something like that.

(00:50:06):
I'm like, "That's not the case." It's just going to be this very effective tool, very similar to GPT-4, and it's also going to be become very normal very quickly. And I think that is actually a really interesting piece. If you can plan for the world where people become very used to these tools very quickly, I actually think that's an edge, and assuming that this thing is going to absolutely change everything, and in many ways I think it's actually a downside, is the wrong mental framing to have of these tools as they come out.

Lenny (00:50:39):
Kind of along these lines, you guys are investing a lot into B2B offerings. I think half the revenue, last I heard, was B2B and then half is B2C. I don't know if that's true, but that's something I heard. What is it that you get if you work with opening AI as a company, as a business? What does it unlock? Is it just called OpenAI Enterprise? What's it called and what do you get as a part of that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:51:01):
Yeah, so I think a lot of our B2B customers are using the API to build stuff. So I think that's one angle of it. I think if you're a ChatGPT B2B customer, we sell Teams, which is the ability to get multiple subscriptions of ChatGPT packaged together. We also have an enterprise version of ChatGPT. There's a bunch of enterprise-y things that enterprise companies want, around SSO and stuff like that, related to ChatGPT Enterprise.

(00:51:25):
I think the coolest thing is actually being able to share some of these prompt templates and GPTs internally. So again, you can make custom things that work really well for your company with all of the information that's relevant to solving problems at your company and share those internally. And to me, that's like you want to be able to collaborate with your teammates on the cool things you create using AI. So that's a huge unlock for companies. I think that those are the two biggest value adds. There's higher limits and stuff like that on some of those models, but I think being able to share your very domain specific applications is the most useful thing.

Lenny (00:52:00):
I think if you're a company listening and you think a lot of employees are using ChatGPT, basically the simplest thing you could do is just roll it up into a business account with single sign-on and that probably saves you money and makes it easier to coordinate and administer.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:14):
Yeah, there's also a bunch of security stuff too, like if you want to control. You don't want people to use certain GPTs from the GPT store because you're worried about security or privacy and stuff like that. You don't want your private data going in places. It makes a lot of sense to sign up for that so that you have a little bit more control over what's happening.

Lenny (00:52:29):
Okay, got it. There's a launch happening tomorrow, I think, after we're recording this. Can you talk about what is new, what's coming out? I think this is going to come out a couple weeks after recording, but just what should people know that's new that's coming out from OpenAI tomorrow in our world?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:45):
Yeah, updated, so there's a few different things. A couple of quick ones are updated GPT-4 Turbo model, updated the preview model that we released that dev day. There's an updated version of that. It fixes this, if folks have seen online people talking about this sort of laziness phenomenon in the model. We improve on that and it fixes a lot of the cases where that was the case. So hopefully the model will be a little bit less lazy. The big thing is the third generation embeddings model. So we were talking off-camera before recording about all of the cool use cases for embedding. So if folks have used embeddings before, it's essentially the technology that powers many of these question and answering with your own documentation or your own corpus of knowledge. And like you were saying, you actually have a website where people can ask questions about recordings of the podcast.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Lennybot.com. Check it out.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:53:35):
Yeah, lennybot.com. And my assumption was that lennybot.com is actually powered by embedding. So you take all of the corpus of knowledge. You take all the recordings, your blog post. You embed them, and then when people ask questions, you can actually go in and see the similarity between the question and the corpus of knowledge and then provide an answer to somebody's question and reference an empirical fact, something that's true from your knowledge base. And this is super useful and people are doing a ton of this. It's like trying to ground these models in reality, in what they know to be true. We know all the things from your podcast to be at least something that you've said before and to be true in that sense, and we can bring them into the answer that the model is actually generating in response to a question. So that'll be super cool.

(00:54:20):
And these new V3 embeddings models, again, state-of-the-art performance, the cool thing is actually the non-English performance has increased super significantly. I think historically, people really were only using embeddings for... It only worked really well for English, and I think now you can use it across so many new languages because it's just so much more performant across those languages and it's five times cheaper as well, which is wonderful. There's no better feeling than making things cheaper for people. I love it. I think now it's like you can embed, I'm pretty sure, it was like 62,000 pages of text for $1, which is very, very cheap. So lots of really cool things that you can do with embeddings and exciting to see people invent more stuff.

Lenny (00:55:07):
What a deal. Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Say you're a product manager at a big company, or even a founder, what do you think are the biggest opportunities for them to leverage the tech that you guys are building, GPT-4, all the other APIs? How should people be thinking about, "Here's how we should really think about leveraging this power in our existing product," or new product, whichever direction you want to go.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:55:34):
Yeah, I think going back to this theme of new experiences is really exciting to me. I think consumers are just going to be... You are going to have an edge on other people if you're providing AI that's not accessible in a Chatbot. People are using a ton of chat and it's a really valuable service area. It's clearly valuable because people are using it. But I think products that move beyond this chat interface really are going to have such an advantage. And also, thinking about how to take your use case to the next level. I've tried a ton of chat examples that are very, very basic and providing a little bit of value to me, but I'm like, "Really this should go much further and actually build your core experience from the ground up."

(00:56:20):
I've used this product that allows you to essentially manage or view the conversations that are happening online around certain topics and stuff like that. So I can go and look online. What are people saying about GPT-4? And what I just said out loud, "What are people saying about GPT-4," is the actual question that I have. And in a normal product experience today, I have to go into a bunch of dashboards and change a bunch of filters and stuff like that. And what I really want is just ask my question. What are people doing? What are people saying about GPT-4? Get an answer to that question in a very data grounded way.

(00:56:55):
And I've seen people solve part of this problem where, oh, they'll be like, "Oh, well here's a few examples of what people are saying and, well, that's not really what I want. I want this summary of what's happening." And I think it just takes a little bit more engineering effort to make that happen. But I think it's like that is the magical unlock of like, "Wow, this is an incredible product that I'm going to continue to use," instead of like, "Yeah, this is kind of useful, but I really want more."

Lenny (00:57:21):
Awesome. I'll give a shout-out to a product. I'm not an investor, but I know the founder, called visualelectric.com, which I think is doing exactly this. It's basically a tool specifically built for creatives, I think specifically graphic design, to help them create imagery. So there's like Dali, obviously, but this takes it to a whole new level where it's kind of this canvas, infinite canvas, that you could just generate images, edit, tweak them, and continue to rate until you have the thing that you need. Visualelectric.com.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:57:48):
I'm going to try that out. Is it similar to Canva?

Lenny (00:57:50):
It's even more niche, I think, for more sophisticated graphic design, I think, is the use case. But I'm not a designer, so I'm not the target customer. But I will say my wife is a graphic designer. She had never used AI tools. I showed her this and she got hooked on it. She paid for it without even telling me that she was going to become a paid customer, and she created imagery of our dog and all this art. And now it's like on our TV. The art she created is now sitting... It's like we have a frame TV, and that's the image on our TV. So anyway...

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:21):
I love that. What was it called again?

Lenny (00:58:23):
Visualelectric.com. Anyway, anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:31):
I've made this statement a few times online and other places, but for people who have cool ideas that they should build with AI, this is the moment. There are so many cool things that need to be built for the world using AI. And again, if I or other folks on the team at OpenAI can be helpful in getting you over the hump of starting that journey of building something really cool, please reach out. The world needs more cool solutions using these tools, and would love to hear about the awesome stuff that people are building.

Lenny (00:59:01):
I would've asked you this at the end, but how would people reach out? What's the best way to actually do that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:06):
Twitter, LinkedIn. My email should be findable somewhere. I don't want to say it and then get slammed with a bunch of email. You should be able to sign my email, if you need it, online somewhere. But yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn is usually the easiest place.

Lenny (00:59:18):
And how do they find you on Twitter?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:21):
It's just Logan Kilpatrick, or I think my name shows up as Logan.GPT or-

Lenny (00:59:21):
Logan.GPT?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:26):
Or official Logan K.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay. And we'll link into it in the show notes. Amazing. Well Logan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:39):
I think the first one is one that I read a long time ago and came back to recently, is the One Room Schoolhouse by Sal Khan. Incredible. Yeah, I don't want... It's the lightning round so I won't say too much, but incredible story and AI is what is going to enable Sal Khan's vision of a teacher per student to actually happen. So I'm really excited about that. And the other one is, that I always come back to, is Why We Sleep. Sleep science are so cool. If you don't care about your sleep, it's one of the biggest up-levels that you can do for yourself.

Lenny (01:00:14):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:00:18):
I'm a sucker for a good inspirational human story. So I watched, with my family recently over the holidays, this Gran Turismo movie, and it's a story about someone who, a kid from London, who grew up doing SIM racing, which is a virtual race car, and did this competition, ended up becoming a real professional race car driver through some competition. And it's just really cool to see someone go from driving a virtual car to driving a real car and competing in the 24-hour Le Mans and all that stuff.

Lenny (01:00:50):
I used to play that game and it was a lot of fun, but I don't think I have any clue how to drive a real car, race car. So that's inspiring. Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:03):
Yeah, I'm always curious to hear what people's... The thing that they so strongly believe that people disagree with them on.

Lenny (01:01:12):
What do you look for in an answer that seems like, Wow, that's a really good signal?"

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:17):
Oftentimes, it's just an entertaining question to ask in some sense, but it's also... It's interesting to see what somebody's deeply held strong belief is, I think. And not to judge whether or not I believe in that, but just curious to see why people feel that way.

Lenny (01:01:35):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:38):
On the narrative of sleep, I have this really nice sleep mask from this company called... Not being paid. I just say this, but it's called Manta Sleep or something like that. It's a weighted sleep mask and it feels incredible when I... I don't know. Maybe I just have a heavy head or something like that, but it feels good to wear a weighted sleep mask at night. I really appreciate it.

Lenny (01:02:01):
I have a competing sleep mask that I highly recommend. I'm trying to find it. I've emailed people about it a couple of times in my newsletter for gift guides.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
Okay. My favorite is called the Waoaw Sleep Mask, W-A-O-A-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:15):
What do you like about it?

Lenny (01:02:16):
W-A-O-A-W. I'll link to it in the show notes. It makes a lot of room. It's very large and there's space for your eyes, so your eyelashes and whatever eyes aren't pressed on, and it just fits really nicely around the head. And my wife, we both wear eye masks at night. It just, speaking of sleep, really helps us sleep. [inaudible 01:02:37] It doesn't have the weight-ness piece, so it might be worth trying, but everyone I've recommended this to is like, "That changed my life. Thank you for helping me sleep better." And so we'll link to [inaudible 01:02:51].

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:17):
Look at that.

Lenny (01:02:50):
Look at us. So adult. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:58):
Yeah, I've got it. It's on a Post-It note that I... Right behind my camera and it's "Measure in hundreds." I love this idea of measuring things in hundreds, and it's for folks who are at the beginning of some journey. I talk to people all the time, they're like, "Yeah, I've tried this thing and it hasn't worked." And if your mental model is to measure in hundreds, "I measure in hundreds," the five times that you failed at something, you failed and tried zero times. And I love that. It's such a great reminder that everything in life is built on compounding and multiple attempts at stuff. And if you don't try enough times, you're never going to be successful at it.

Lenny (01:03:38):
I love that. I could see why you are successful at OpenAI and why you're a good fit there. Final question. So I asked ChatGPT for a very silly question. "Give me a bunch of silly questions to ask Logan Kilpatrick, head of developer relations at OpenAI," and I went through a bunch. I have three here, but I'm going to pick one. If an AI started doing standup comedy, what do you think would be its go-to joke or funny observation about humans?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:06):
I think today, I think if you were to do this, I think the go-to question would be something along the, "So an AI walks into a bar," and likely because, again, it's trained on some distribution of training data, and that's the most common joke that comes up, and that's probably... I wonder if you came up with a joke right now, whether or not that would show up in one of the examples.

Lenny (01:04:31):
I love it. What would be the joke though? We need the joke. We need the punchline. I'm just joking. I know you can't come up with amazing-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:37):
That's what we have ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:04:41):
We're already irrelevant. Amazing. Logan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, even though you've already shared this information, but just for folks to remind them. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:55):
Yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn, Logan Kilpatrick or Logan.GPT on Twitter. Please shoot me messages. I get a ton of DMs from people and it's always really, really interesting stuff. I think the thing that I would love to have help on is if people find bugs and things that don't work well in ChatGPT, I oftentimes see people be like, "This thing didn't work really well." And the key, and I think we as OpenAI need to do a better job of messaging this to people, but having shared chats or actual, tangible, reproducible examples, are the two things that we need in order to actually fix the problems that people have. The model laziness was a good example where it was hard to figure out what was going on because people would be like, "Oh, the model's lazier," but it's hard to figure out what were the prompts they were using. What was the examples, all that stuff? So send those examples as you come up on things that don't work well and we'll make stuff better for you.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Amazing. And I'll also just remind people, if you're listening to this and you're like, "Oh, okay, cool. A lot of cool ideas for OpenAI and ChatGPT," what you need to do is actually just go to chat.openai.com and try this stuff out. There's a lot of just theorizing, but I think once you actually start doing it, you start to see things a little differently. And at this point, every day I'm in there doing something, like asking for ideas for questions, doing research on a newsletter post, and it's just a tab I'm always coming back to. And I know there's a lot of people just talking about this sort of thing, and I just want to remind people. Just go. Sign in. Play with it. Ask it questions on something you're working on and just see how it goes and keep coming back to it. Is there anything else you want to share along those lines to inspire people to give this a shot?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:06:34):
I love it. I think the phrase of people being worried about humans being replaced by AI, and I've seen this narrative online, that it's not AI that's going to replace humans. It's other humans that are being augmented and using AI tools that are going to be more competitive in a job market and stuff like that. So go and try these AI tools. This is the best time to learn. You're going to be more productive and empowered in your job and the things that you're excited about. So yeah, excited to see what people use ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:07:01):
And then you can expense your account. I think it's 10 or 20 bucks a month. A lot of companies are paying for this for you, so ask your boss if you can just have it expensed and make sure you use the latest version. Anyway, Logan, thank you again so much for being here.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:16):
This is awesome, Lenny. Thanks for having me in. Thoughtful questions. Hopefully those weren't all from ChatGPT.

Lenny (01:07:20):
Nope, only the last one. I did have a bunch of others I had in the belt or in the pocket. I don't know what the metaphor is. In the back pocket, that's the metaphor, but I did not get to them because we had enough great stuff. So no, that was all me. Human AI.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:35):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:07:36):
Thanks, Logan.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:37):

# Leveraging growth advisors, mastering SEO, and honing your craft | Luc Levesque (Shopify, Meta)

## Transcript

Luc Levesque (00:00:00):
We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact. Something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack." And then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Luc Levesque. Luc is currently the chief growth officer at Shopify. Before this, he was recruited personally by Mark Zuckerberg to help grow Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. He's also VP of Growth and a GM at Tripadvisor. He's also been a growth advisor to companies like Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Thumbtack, and Canva.

Lenny (00:01:05):
In our conversation, Luc shares advice on how and when to think about getting a growth advisor, including how to structure the relationship and what to look for in an advisor. We also spent a ton of time on SEO, how to think about this as a growth channel, who it's well suited for, and how everything is about to change in SEO with Bard and ChatGPT. Plus Luc shares a ton of really interesting advice around the value of self-reflection, building routines, cold plunges, also a couple of amazing stories about working with Zuck and what you learned from him. This is such an insight rich episode and I know you'll love it. With that, I bring you Luc Levesque after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Luc, welcome to the podcast.

Luc Levesque (00:03:34):
Thank you. Good to see you.

Lenny (00:03:36):
It's good to see you too. I want to start with a story that you shared once when we were hanging out in the past and something that I'll never forget, and it's about the time that you just joined Facebook and apparently you had some kind of big presentation you had to give to the entire company or the executive staff. And then I just love the way it kind of unfolded and it kind of gives you a glimpse into what it's like to work with Zuck and at Facebook. Can you share that story if that rings a bell?

Luc Levesque (00:04:00):
If remember the story, well, basically I had just started at Facebook about... I'll use those two interchangeably. I remember it as Facebook and I always will. I was three months in and was working on a new area for me. So I came in, started putting together our thoughts on a strategy and was asked to do a presentation in front of the company with Mark on the strategy. So I whipped up a draft strategy, put together some plots and plans, presented in front of the company and went well. And then every six months there's something called the [inaudible 00:04:32] Team Review of Facebook and basically product area leads will go in and present their strategy, how it's going. Again, I just joined three months before, so I walk in no idea what to expect. I am sitting at a table. You can kind of envision it's a big room, a really big room with a bunch of tables set up in a big square with a little microphone.

Luc Levesque (00:04:50):
So I sit in there, there's Mark and all the executives sitting on the other side. And I sit down and it's quiet for what felt like five minutes. I'm sure it was not, but it was quiet for a while, just sitting there waiting for what's going to happen now. And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, "Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product. It's because they focus exclusively on that magic word, which is impact.

Luc Levesque (00:05:44):
And that was kind of my first introduction to working with Mark and just that laser focus on, "All right, got it. Now when are we going to start seeing impact and kind of moving from there?" So it's something that is very much in the culture there and something that is so important. It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, "I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, "Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months. And yeah, we jumped in and started focusing on having a lot of impact from there.

Lenny (00:06:36):
I love that story. There's a couple things there. One is, if I were in your shoes, I'd poop my pants sitting there for five minutes waiting for what do you guys-

Luc Levesque (00:06:45):
That did not happen. I had a report.

Lenny (00:06:47):
Okay. How did it go? How did you deal with it? Or I guess how did you respond?

Luc Levesque (00:06:51):
Well, we had, funny enough, already started having impact, so I was able to at least respond with, "Hey, we've kind of already started in a few ways" and walk through where we were having impact and just focus on the strategy, what our plans forward were and where we wanted to go from there. So I think that's how I responded.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Okay, great work. So something I've started doing actually on this podcast is I've started to keep a little Post-it of, here it is, of themes that continue to recur across companies that are most successful. And impact comes... It's number one on my Post-it here, is just impact comes up so often as something that the best companies continue to come back to and focus on and put a lot of emphasis on. I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?

Luc Levesque (00:07:42):
Yeah, I mean I think it's easy for a lot of leaders and companies to get caught up in how hard are people working, what did they do, and recognizing and rewarding activity. I mean, everybody wants to have impact. The companies that truly focus on that are the ones that break through and really make a lot of progress towards the mission. So that seems obvious I think when I say it out loud, but being in that culture and having it really ingrained in everything you do whether it's performance reviews or strategies or these reviews with the executive team, it all gravitates around impact. And I think it's that laser focus on it that matters so much. But I mean I've certainly seen it going other ways where it's more about working long hours. And certainly there's a correlation, to be clear, between working hard and impact, but I find it's just such a precise way to think about how people are performing or what you're doing in terms of is your strategy working? Is the direction you're moving in having the intended outcomes that you want? And yeah, I do think it's all about that.

Luc Levesque (00:08:46):
Being a growth leader where everything's so measurable, impact is something that can be very clearly measured and you know whether you have it or not. So the most important thing that we work on constantly is reviewing what's our strategy, what are we working on? Is that driving towards the top level north star outcome we want? Is that having the impact? And then basically doing everything around that singular north star. So it's very, very important. I think it's more profound than it might seem just from the outside. But if you've worked in different companies, you've probably experienced different versions of this too.

Lenny (00:09:20):
Yeah. I want to spend more time on this, but before we move on, you also have another Zuck story. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Zuck recruited you personally to join Facebook/Meta. Is that true? And then if true, what was that like to be recruited by Zuck personally?

Luc Levesque (00:09:35):
It was an interesting experience, very intense, but also one of the reasons for it was I was living in Canada and my family was there and I had some strong personal reasons why I couldn't leave Canada. But yeah, we had a lot of discussions with Mark. I won't get into the micro details of it, that's more Mark's story to tell than mine. But a few takeaways from going through that experience. As a leader, hiring is the most important thing as we all know. It's a craft and a skill that I'm always working on refining. I have my own playbook that I'm constantly tweaking, testing out different approaches, trying to find the best talent and assessing them and trying to close them and bringing them on board. So I learned a lot through that experience with Mark.

Luc Levesque (00:10:15):
A couple things that stood out were the first one would be that Mark really involved the entire executive team. It wasn't just me talking to recruiting or talent or HR or just Mark, it was the entire executive team. That's something that I think a lot of leaders don't take advantage of. I've seen leaders, I've certainly done this at times where you go it alone or you're working with recruiting, but the reality is all the leaders, all the execs in the company know how important it's to bring in talent and they're always more than happy to help. So that's something that I think more leaders should do is really recruit all of their peers and their leaders in the company to help close. And that's certainly something that happened when I was in discussions with Mark and Facebook about joining.

Luc Levesque (00:10:55):
The second one, which I had I suppose never experienced before, was that they made it very personal. I had these reasons why I couldn't leave. So initially I was excited by the opportunity, but I couldn't see myself moving to California for personal reasons. And through discussions, Mark basically involved my wife, involved my spouse in this, Andrea. We flew down, had dinner with him and Priscilla, his wife. Andrea had ended up meeting with many of the executives at Facebook and really talking through what was holding us back, why we couldn't come, potential options and ideas for how we could come down.

Luc Levesque (00:11:33):
But involving somebody's spouse and family I think is a really good idea because it's a very personal decision to change company. It involves more than just that person you're talking to, it involves the whole family. So that was something that I think is an important thing to have in your kind of playbook for hiring, is really think about the whole person's family and involve them if you can. In fact, Toby did this as well at Shopify. He flew down here with Fiona and we had breakfast with Andrea and them and reviewed a few offers when I joined Shopify.

Luc Levesque (00:12:03):
And then the third thing is just to be absolutely relentless and don't give up and don't let momentum drop. It took seven months for me to go from, "This is amazing, exciting, but there's no way I can make this work" to, "Okay, let's move to Palo Alto." And Mark, the execs, a variety of leaders there were in discussions for months and months and months and never letting the momentum die. That's something that I think is really important. No doesn't necessarily mean no, and in this case it definitely wasn't the case. I had the same experience with Toby at Shopify where we've been talking about working together for over 10 years now. And then finally the timing was right and I was able to join the company.

Luc Levesque (00:12:45):
So just be relentless, involve the family, involve the spouse if you can, and recruit some help from other executives in the company. Those were some of the things that stood out through my experience. But yeah, it was a pretty wild time in my life.

Lenny (00:13:00):
Relentless is actually another word. I wasn't necessarily I'm supposed to yet, but I feel like it's another trend to cross. The most impactful and successful founders is just this like, "I will not give up. I will keep at it."

Luc Levesque (00:13:09):
[inaudible 00:13:10].

Lenny (00:13:10):
And so that's a really interesting example of that in action. I was going to talk about this later, but maybe it's a good time to talk about it now, which is around hiring. So you talked about you have this playbook for how to hire. You mentioned to me that you kind of find that as you scale as a leader, hiring ends up being like the most important skill maybe, maybe one of the most important skills. I'd love to hear your take on just what you found about hiring as you've grown as a product leader.

Luc Levesque (00:13:33):
Well, I think you reach a point in your career where you realize that hiring is the skill you now need to become world-class at because you're not no longer doing the work yourself. You're still of course involved and doing some of the work and getting your hands dirty, but the bulk of your team's success now will be the quality of the hires you make and you truly need to be world-class at that. So yeah, I built this playbook out. I was in Canada in Ottawa when I sold that company, Tripadvisor, and really started growing my team and becoming more Leaning into leadership at the time through that experience.

Luc Levesque (00:14:07):
One of the benefits of being in Ottawa and kind of off the grid if you will, is it's a curse and a benefit as that you don't have a ton of people you can learn from. So it does mean you need to go to first principles and think things through from the ground up. It takes a little longer, but you come up with your own playbooks on how to do things. I think you've seen my blueprint, which is a good example of that where I have this blueprint I put together. When new people join the team, I show them my blueprint, which is basically a list of my quirks so we can really quickly align. That's something that just being in Ottawa and trying to figure out how to be a leader and avoid mistakes, I was like, "Wouldn't it be nice if you had a blueprint? When somebody joined, you can just tell them all of your quirks and you can just quickly calibrate on how it is to work together versus through awkward long discussions over the course of a year."

Luc Levesque (00:14:51):
My hiring playbook's a similar thing. I think of it in three different chapters, if you will. There's finding talent, assessing talent, and closing talent. In terms of finding talent, I do believe that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. So I'm looking for what I call signs of excellence. So I want to know the top people generally have done multiple amazing things in their life, repeated success, not just once. Maybe it was work related, maybe not work related. But generally speaking, if you think back to the stars you've worked with, they've done some amazing things. And that's why I always start when I interview or when I chat with people, I started talking about just trying to understand, "What has been your path? What have you done professionally and not professionally?" And generally, stars going to stand out. It's very rare that there's not something obvious that comes through.

Luc Levesque (00:15:39):
So for myself personally, I'm looking for kind of three different signs of excellence to tell me that it doesn't have to be three. The mental model I have is as you're talking to them, you're getting pluses and negatives. There's red flags you're hearing and there's really great things. And then at the end you can make an opinion of how good this person is.

Luc Levesque (00:15:56):
Another great sign of excellence, and this was just through reflecting on stars on the team and thinking what makes them unique, what about them. One of them is when somebody's boss leaves the company and then comes back to poach them, that is such a strong signal because if you think of what just happened, the leader who knows exactly how good this person you're talking to is, they have the most knowledge of the performance of this individual, they left the company. They've come back to poach them, putting their own reputation at risk by coming back depending on the situation. And they would never do that unless this person was really, really good.

Luc Levesque (00:16:37):
So you don't want to over pivot on one signal, you want to look at the full picture. But those are the types of things I look at to bring in top talent. And I've got this whole playbook, mistakes I've made that I've learned from, things to avoid. And over the years, yeah, I've put together this playbook that I try to follow and I'm always running little experiments to try to make it better.

Lenny (00:16:56):
Were going to that blueprint that you mentioned. A lot of which you're talking about is probably more relevant to senior executive type people because you're looking for... Or maybe not because you're looking for say three.

Luc Levesque (00:17:06):
[inaudible 00:17:06].

Lenny (00:17:06):
Okay. So people early in their career could also have three, say, moments of excellence?

Luc Levesque (00:17:12):
Yeah, I mean just thinking off the top, it depends on the type of person you're hiring, but are they a founder? Have they tried to do something? Did they win an award somewhere? Are they a gold medalist at something? Have they done something that others have not that shows grit, that shows drive, that shows the ability to succeed? And I've seen that you can apply that to any candidate you're hiring.

Lenny (00:17:36):
The implication there is, without that, they're probably not going to be stars, that there's a strong correlation between having signs of excellence and them performing really well in this role.

Luc Levesque (00:17:45):
Correct, exactly. Yeah, I mean I suppose it's possible, but it would be pretty rare that somebody would come in without some sign that they stand above the crowd. And again, I'm talking about you generally want to hire the top 1% of candidates. So when you're looking for the best of the best, you definitely are looking for those signals.

Lenny (00:18:01):
Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to bring us back on the agenda that I had for myself, which is I want to start with talking about advisorships and advising and growth advisors. You've been a growth advisor for a long time to some of the most amazing companies out there, Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Canva, Thumbtack. I'm sure there's others that you don't list that are more informal. Now you work at Shopify. And so what I think about here is a lot of founders often think about, "Should I bring on an advisor? What should I look for an advisor? I've heard stories of advisors being useless sometimes. People tell me I don't need advisors." So I guess the question here is just what's your take on when it makes sense to bring on and consider bringing on a growth advisor and what should people look for when they're exploring and talking to a potential growth advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:18:47):
A few thoughts. In terms of when, I don't think you can probably come into early. It's probably harder to find really good ones than it is to time it. But generally speaking, I would say you don't want to focus too much on growth until you have product market fit. So make sure you have a product that users love that's either showing strong signs of retention or has some good loop that you can see that you can start thinking about growth.

Lenny (00:19:08):
Let me follow on that thread real quick because I find some founders still want to have someone come help them with growth even though they know they don't have product market fit, even though this tip comes up every single time when I'm talking to growth person, like, "Wait till you have product market fit before doing growth stuff." So could you just add a little bit of why that's important while we're on that topic?

Luc Levesque (00:19:27):
Growth advice is generally always applicable. And if you can start thinking about how to build your product early, even if it's pre-product market fit, you're not going to do any damage, but you may be wasting some capital on an advisor or a growth person too early. The problem that I see is if you start growing a product that doesn't have product market fit, you're actually doing more damage than good because you have a product that is now being exposed to the market through growth levers and through optimization that is giving a bad experience with your product. And you want that product that you know is tight and you know has product market fit to start building the flywheel and start growing. You don't want it to be growing if it doesn't satisfy that need that you're trying to build out for. So I can see it having more damage than good because when somebody tries something, they're unlikely to try it again. And so that's the dangerous game you can get into. So you're better off with a good product that's satisfying a need and then growing from there.

Luc Levesque (00:20:20):
I will say to kind of play devil's advocate with myself and something that I've done actually in one of the products, I've built several consumer products and grown them, is that sometimes to know if you have a product, you need users to use it. So there's like some subtlety in here, but I would say if you are trying to get users in to start playing with it at scale, I mean try to focus in on a market that is maybe off the grid. Like pick some English-speaking country that's a bit off the grid that you can isolate your marketing to so you can start getting dozens or a couple hundred people per day coming in and giving you feedback.

Luc Levesque (00:20:58):
I've seen that work too. So I'd say wait till you have product market fit. If you do start growing your product early because you need that signal from people actually using it beyond just focus groups and friends or small numbers of people, try to do it off the grid in smaller markets that you can get kind of contain the growth and get what you're really trying to get, which is that signal on is it working or not.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Awesome. Okay, I threw us off track. Let's get back on track. So we're talking about when it makes sense to find a growth advisor and then what to look for and so on that you might want to work with.

Luc Levesque (00:21:27):
I mean, what makes a great growth advisor is somebody who really understands what to do but also why certain growth levers work. It's that kind of deep understanding of levers of onboarding or whatever area they're focusing on that really makes growth advisor stand out. So when you're looking for a growth advisor, you want to have those discussions to see like, "How much depth does this person have? Have they seen a playbook and they're just good at repeating the playbook or are they evolving, are they growing?" The best way to get to know that is to start really asking them questions about growth and growth advising and the certain things that they've done and why they think those have worked.

Luc Levesque (00:22:09):
This can be tricky if you don't yourself know growth. So I think one thing that I have not seen a lot of founders do that I would advise is if you have an advisor already... Because this applies to finding growth advisors, but it also applies to hiring good growth talent. So if you have somebody you know whether it's already an advisor or somebody who knows growth, you can solicit their help in trying to flesh out whether somebody you're trying to hire is of high talent. So if you have an advisor, you can make that one of their roles is vet out any new talent coming in. And if you're looking for an advisor, try to find somebody that you know and trust who can do that first pass. Because for somebody who knows growth that you trust, it's actually not a lot of work for them to vet out how talented someone else's. It's an easy ask to make and something that if you have that person in your network or that worked with you that you can leverage for.

Luc Levesque (00:23:01):
But I haven't seen that too often where founders kind of take advantage of people they know or existing growth advisors to help recruit and vet talent because it can be quite hard if you don't know the growth space to know if somebody's good or not.

Lenny (00:23:15):
That's a really interesting idea and it could be where you find someone that's too busy to work with you, but maybe you could just ask, "Hey, could you just easily help me vet people?" And it takes a lot less time.

Luc Levesque (00:23:26):
Yeah, I've never been asked that, which is, I mean I don't know if I'll start getting asked this now, but it does seem like that's a really simple way to add a ton of value. And as a founder, I mean even if you have to pay this person or whatever you have to do, but it's such an important hire to get right. We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact where they're either building or helping to ideate or helping to implement a growth loop that literally changes the company. As we know, you need a great product and you need a great growth loop. And it's usually just one loop that you need to get right. Most companies have gotten to where they are just off of one really strong channel that they've just dominated, so it's important to get right.

Lenny (00:24:17):
Is there an example of that sort of impact that you've seen in your advisorship or other people's of just an impact from one conversation or a little bit of a help?

Luc Levesque (00:24:25):
Definitely. And I think what I would point to is the advantage of a growth advisor is it takes a long time to understand a channel. Certainly people have to know their stuff, they have to be very good at their craft, their growth craft, but also they have to be exposed to a large set of experiments or an environment where they've just seen what works and what doesn't. So no matter how good somebody is, if they haven't been exposed to an environment where there's a lot of experimentation, a lot of learning, it's very hard for them to internalize that. So once a growth advisor has that, it's takes years to learn it, but it literally can take seconds literally to communicate that. So I've worked with some companies that you've mentioned and certainly have had impact very quickly.

Luc Levesque (00:25:09):
I mean, one example would be a company that I worked with. Now, a public company. At the time, they weren't. On day one, walked in, they presented their strategy, their plans, their funnels and their landing pages. I could see very quickly that there was something they were doing that was a little off and I asked them, "Well, why are you doing it that way?" And they said, "Well, we think it just looks better that way." And I said, "Well, just do it this other way." I remember this because it was such a short conversation and then three weeks later we connected and I heard they had rolled it out and it was a large impact that they had from this one change. This has happened many times with the companies I've worked with, but it's a good example that once you know it, it's not hard to recognize it if you deeply understand it to give advice, but it takes a long time to get the base knowledge.

Luc Levesque (00:26:02):
So I don't do these too often anymore, but when I do advise, I take them very seriously. I focus exclusively on having impact. I think that's really important because like you say, there's a lot of advisors out there. Some of them are great, some of them different qualities, and you really want to make sure that if you are an advisor, you want to be in the camp of when this person comes in, they have a lot of impact and it takes time and focus and energy and alignment and there's a bunch of things we can talk about that that helps to drive that alignment. But having impact is the most important thing, whether you're an advisor or if you're hiring because it's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:26:49):
There's that word impact again,

Luc Levesque (00:26:51):
Impact. Impact.

Lenny (00:26:52):
The point you just made about how one conversation can have a ton of impact is a reminder of why sometimes the price of an advisor feels absurd where like, "For one hour it's like thousands of dollars," but it's because obviously they spent a decade learning a thing and one conversation is all of that work they put into it crystallized for you in the moment.

Luc Levesque (00:27:13):
Exactly. It's something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack" and then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's exhilarating. It's great. I have something I used to say, which is, you want your impact to be so big there's a slide in the next board deck on try to explain what happened. That can happen when you are advising companies because you're able to share a very quickly insights. But one way to drive alignment is not everybody can do this, not all advisors do it this way, but I personally love just when I do these, which is not that frequent, just purely doing equity because I love the alignment in outcomes where the founder will be successful and you will be successful. So the incentives are really good to drive the right performance and the right outcomes that you want as a founder.

Luc Levesque (00:28:09):
So if you can do it, I would definitely advise founders to bring advisors in for equity if you can. I think the same applies for your internal growth team. You want to make sure that the teams are incentivized not on activities, on doing stuff, because there's a lot of stuff to be done in growth, but really driving the outcomes that you want. And equity's just a great way of saying, "Hey, we're in this together. We're on the same side of the table. Let's go grow this company."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I was actually about to ask you what kind of structure you recommend for an advisorship. Is there anything else you can share about just what you'd recommend a founder do in terms of compensation for an advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:28:45):
There's a couple things. I'm a big fan of equity because of the alignment of incentives. You should think about, without getting into too much detail of the actual structure of the deals, but think about how you vest the equity. The last thing you want is an advisor holding back on sharing knowledge. The ideal engagement would be an advisor comes in, delivers as much value as possible quickly, and then trains your team. And then maybe it's a one-year engagement and hopefully they've learned because the advisor has been incentivized to share as much as possible and to train the team as much as possible. And then ideally you don't need them anymore after. So there's something there about structuring equity vesting. I'm a big fan of vesting earlier rather than later. So think about in terms of structure you're vesting, commensurate with the value you want, which is very much front loaded.

Luc Levesque (00:29:35):
I'm also a big fan of three month cliffs. Something I've done, I always do actually, is listen, in the first three months you'll know both sides if it's working or not. And you want to de-risk that on both sides because it really should be seen as a partnership between the advisor and the founder. If the founder thinks you're not adding value in the first few months, I think they should just tear it up and both sides move on. It's not good for the founder to continue the deal and it's not good frankly for the advisor because they're not, for some reason, able to add value in that environment. So I love a three-month cliff at the beginning where if it's not working in the first three months, you tear up the deal and both parties walk away and de-risk the entire thing, and again, drives incentives in the right way where the advisor is 100% incentivized at as much value as fast as possible. And so that's another thing that I tend to do and I've done it for a long time.

Lenny (00:30:28):
That's a really good tip. Basically don't do it for a year if you're vesting for advisors, probably not even to a year, but yeah.

Luc Levesque (00:30:33):
There's a bunch of ways to do it. Honestly, it's hard enough to find growth advisors that have capacity, so you got to also say like, "What can you do that the advisor's comfortable with?" But yeah, I mean just to be candid, I think you want to structure in a way where you're not dependent on the advisor over time. They're adding a ton of value, they're helping teach the team, they're probably bouncing around because your company's changing, your team's changing, your leaders are changing. But over time, and that can be years, but it shouldn't be indefinite. You shouldn't need an advisor forever.

Luc Levesque (00:31:04):
I've seen a scenario where there's desire to keep the advisor on almost as insurance, like, "If something goes wrong, I just wanted to be able to pick up the phone." That can make sense. But I do think a good growth advisor is incentivized to share as much as possible, as fast as possible to have impact to train your team. And then whether you want to keep them on or not long term as an insurance policy or just to answer questions as things change, that should be a choice and not because, "If we lose the advisor. We're completely screwed." That would be a bad place for you to be in as a founder.

Lenny (00:31:35):
You said it's hard to find a good advisor, 100% agree. Any advice for people to help them find an advisor that might be the right fit?

Luc Levesque (00:31:43):
Yeah, I would say there's more of them these days than there were even just five years ago or 10 years ago. Depending on your situation, if you're a founder, I would start with your investors. I think VCs have an amazing network of advisors. I get, I don't know, a couple requests a week that I'm not taking right now. But that from my experience and what I've seen, that's probably especially the high end VCs, the very talented VCs will have this network. And frankly, it's a great partnership as an advisor for you to have. You can help the companies, you can help the VCs and it helps you. So everybody wins, just asking other founders that had good experience, much like hiring.

Luc Levesque (00:32:21):
The third advice I would give is to find companies that are world-class at what you're trying to grow, what channel or skill you're looking at, and then reach out and see if there's a way to help that way. That's actually how I got started. I was at Tripadvisor and a prominent VC reached out. One of the companies they were working with needed some help on SEO. I was still in Canada at the time, got connected with them, had a phone call, had a significant impact through that one phone call. And rather than joining as an advisor, I essentially helped them out pro bono in exchange for, "Hey, I want to get connected in the Valley." So I was in Canada, I wanted to start another company, I wanted to get connected. So through that tactic where they reached out to a company that was known to be world-class at SEO, I think that was really smart on this VC's part.

Luc Levesque (00:33:13):
And then maybe some advice to up and coming growth advisors would be that first one, I didn't take a single shred of equity or money and just tried to have as much impact as possible and to help out this company as much as possible and then make sure that I was able to get connected to other people that I wanted to meet in the Bay Area. And then kind of things snowballed from there.

Lenny (00:33:33):
I definitely want to chat about how to become a growth advisor because I think people listening here might be like, "Oh, that sounds pretty good. Someday maybe I'll become a growth advisor." But before we get to that, what are things that an advisor are best suited for versus finding someone full-time versus no one? What are the ideal kind of problem sets for an advisor versus say, full-time hire person?

Luc Levesque (00:33:57):
I would say your preference should always be to have somebody in-house. I'll start there because you want to have that as part of the culture. There's so much more that they can do when they're in-house. That being said, if you can't find somebody in-house, then bring on an advisor... Even if you bring on an advisor, some advice to founders would be you want to surround your team or at least one person that you've identified who's just a amazing world-class doer, even if they don't know growth, with a set of growth advisors so that they're learning, that's being put through the culture of the company and that knowledge stays inside of the company. So I'd say I would prefer to go internal, surround these people with great advisors and then take it from there. That would be how I approach it.

Lenny (00:34:41):
Okay. So two thoughts here. One is I feel like this podcast is becoming an interesting way to discover awesome growth advisors. I think over time I'm building this directory of who are awesome, smart growth people that are open to advising. So that could be an interesting opportunity to just look through the folks on this podcast and-

Luc Levesque (00:34:59):
Yep, there's some great people that have been on here. Definitely.

Lenny (00:35:02):
Totally working my way through all the amazing least smart growth people and product leaders. The other is I've noticed they're a lot of the best growth advisors have worked with the same sorts of companies. I find Miro comes up a lot, Canva comes up a lot, Pinterest. All these people that have worked with say Pinterest that I hear about are just awesome. Casey comes to mind, Melissa Tan who's coming out with a podcast, I think she worked with them. Dropbox. Anyway, so maybe one idea, see who these companies work with as advisors and that can maybe point you to people that are worth exploring.

Luc Levesque (00:35:34):
I mean, that's a good idea. It kind of goes back to something I mentioned earlier, which is companies that have a lot of traffic and that have a lot of users are a great learning ground for growth people and for advisors, because no matter how smart you are, you need the reps. You got to go to the growth gym and put in the reps, which is experiments. You've got to try things, things that are going to work, things that aren't going to work. There's a discipline of when something doesn't work, you can learn almost as much as when something works. But you need that traffic, you need that environment. And that's why certain companies have these great people coming out like Casey at Pinterest and other people that have been at these companies that have the traffic, have the culture to support it, to support growth. I don't think that's a coincidence why some of these companies have some great people coming from them.

Lenny (00:36:20):
The other tip I just thought about as you were talking is everyone's launching a Substack newsletter that is doing any sort of advising because there's a lot of power in building an audience and creating kind of awareness of what you do. So I wonder if another tip is search Substack's directory of newsletters for specific things you're dealing with, like say, go to PLG or sales and you might find someone there."

Luc Levesque (00:36:39):
I haven't done that, but that seems like a reasonable way to do it.

Lenny (00:36:42):
That's where we're all heading.

Luc Levesque (00:36:44):
I'm not saying that the people on Substack have this. But as advice to the people listening, is when you're vetting for a growth advisor or growth talent, don't just wait it on the public halo of somebody. That's a common mistake I've seen where maybe somebody's done presentations at a conference or somebody's done... I don't know, but their Twitter following is broad. They can be excellent. That's not a disqualifier immediately, but just make sure not to make the hire just exclusively on that. I've made that mistake a few times and it's a common one to get into. So make sure you're vetting properly, even if somebody with a large following on Substack or Twitter. That's I think an important thing to keep in mind.

Lenny (00:37:25):
1000% agree. I always say that the best product leader is the best growth. People don't have time to sit on Twitter and tweet and write newsletters. They're doing the job, working, building, growing, and maybe eventually they get out of that and start writing. But I 1000% agree, there's a lot of people-

Luc Levesque (00:37:40):
Well, not to disqualify all the people on Twitter.

Lenny (00:37:43):
Absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:37:43):
Some of them are tweeting [inaudible 00:37:45], but my point is just don't over pivot on the halo. Just look at their past performance. What teams have they been on? What environment do they have? Do they really know growth? And sometimes they do, but I think it's a common mistake to say, "Oh yeah, they have a large following, let's hire this person." That's poorly.

Lenny (00:38:03):
1000% agree. Rarely does a celebrity hire that seems really genius on Twitter and Substack end up being as amazing as you think.

Luc Levesque (00:38:12):
Yeah, it does happen, but yeah.

Lenny (00:38:13):
It does happen. Absolutely. One last question around this topic. People listening might want to become growth advisors, I'd mentioned this earlier. Is there any other advice you want to share? Just like, "If you want to become a growth advisor someday, here's what you should think about."

Luc Levesque (00:38:26):
Yeah, I think the right mental model as a growth advisor is around the same one as an investor. So the most important thing an advisor can do aside from having impact and knowing their craft is picking which companies to work with, especially if you're working for equity. So I'll only speak to that, but you're basically putting in your time, you're picking likely a smaller number. You only have so many hours in the day of companies to work with and you want to make sure there's a likely exit in the future. So for me personally, I have a spreadsheet, like most big decisions that I make in my life. Over the years I've just added criteria and questions to ask myself about the company and then reflect on, "Okay, is this kind of checking all the boxes for a likely outcome?" Because you don't just need to be successful, you need to be successful and for the company to be successful and for there to be liquidity of that.

Luc Levesque (00:39:17):
So you need to put yourself in the shoes of an investor and look at it as an investment. That is arguably the most important thing because you can go and do a great job and then wait many years and potentially not see any reward for it. And I think that's the nice thing about the equity structure in that you're tied in the same incentives with the founder, which is just great in terms of any relationship to have the same incentives, but you want to make sure that there's a good likelihood of a decent outcome down the road.

Luc Levesque (00:39:49):
If I can throw another one in.

Lenny (00:39:49):
Yeah, absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:39:50):
The other piece of advice I would give is it can take a long time for some of these companies to be successful. That's okay. You should expect that. In fact, you should just go in with that mindset. When I'm deciding to work with a company, I'm in there for 10 years and I know that and I say that. And I say, "I'm in. We're in this together if I choose to work with the company." But it does mean that the structure of the deal needs to reflect that. So you need to have a long tail at the end.

Luc Levesque (00:40:15):
So if you're taking options or RSUs and it's pure of the equity, make sure you have the time for that to happen. There would be nothing worse than putting your heart and soul having impact and then waiting, I don't know, a couple years and then your equity expires. So you make sure there's a long tail. I mean, it can literally take over 10 years for these companies to exit. And you should be okay with that. I think that's okay. You're taking some risks. They're taking some risk on you and that's a great partnership, but you'll just need the time for that. So advice to growth advisors, make sure to ask for a long tail so that you don't end up in a bad spot in the end. And that incentives, again, are perfectly aligned between the founder and the advisor.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is the next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:41:59):
So I want to segue to a different topic, SEO. You're kind of the... You tell me, but it feels like you're one of the earliest SEO people in tech. You helped grow Tripadvisor many years ago and it was mostly SEO-driven. I think you innovated a lot of SEO tactics and strategies. And then you helped Pinterest, Thumbtack, other companies that are very SEO-driven. You talked about how many companies grow through one channel and these are all very SEO-driven companies. I imagine Shopify has a lot of SEO work that's happening right now with you there. And so I want to chat about SEO. So I guess broadly SEO is like... It's like this amazing growth channel. It's basically free. It continues to work after you stop doing any work on it for a while. Many founders think about, "Should we invest in SEO? How do we approach SEO?" So maybe just as a first question, what are signs that your product and company is a good fit for SEO being potentially a huge channel for growth?

Luc Levesque (00:42:55):
Yeah, I've been doing SEO for a really long time. It's a lot of fun and certainly being a supervisor was a great learning ground for that, that we were able to really innovate and try new things there. In terms of the playbook that we built out. That was a lot of fun, those years.

Luc Levesque (00:43:11):
Couple thoughts. The first one would be I do think there's an SEO play in any company. Maybe at a different extent, but Google is such a large funnel of existing demand for your product or your product area that there's usually an angle to get some SEO traffic there. So I do think it applies to most companies. I would say if you're an early product that the world's never seen, it's a brand new thing, there might be some creation, some demand creation you need to do, but most of the time there's existing demand in Google where you can harvest demand or there's queries that are related to your topic that you can start ranking for to start building brand awareness. So there's always some angle.

Luc Levesque (00:43:52):
And then I kind of divide websites or online products into two categories. There's the ones which are smaller sites, small number of pages, very targeted at your product and don't have this kind of loop of creating new pages automatically. Most eCommerce sites actually have would a number of pages around the products and about us, those types of pages. That's one type of sites. Let's say they have dozen pages. And then there's other ones with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of pages which are either user generated content like Tripadvisor and Pinterest and others, or marketplaces like Thumbtack and other types of websites like that. Those are generally easier to see a huge amount of impact very quickly because there's such a large optimization surface and ideally it's growing and generating traffic automatically.

Luc Levesque (00:44:40):
I've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop where if you recall when it was just starting, everybody was getting these invites from LinkedIn. Those come and go. You get an invite, you register, you don't. That happens. But the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow. So that's a good example of use generated content which kind of feeds on itself and grows. So there's those two categories. Going back to the first category, if you only have a small handful of pages, the way to think about that is you certainly want to optimize those pages, then you want to start creating content that speaks to your audience beyond that. So you need a content strategy, whether it's a blog or creating new parts of your site that address questions that your audience might have. But generally speaking, I think there's an SEO play in any company and there's just different tactics, strategies, and approaches to get there.

Lenny (00:45:40):
Awesome. I never thought of it that way, that there's kind of these two buckets. So the first bucket is like you don't have a ton of pages that naturally are generated as a part of your experience. And the second is you do. I guess in the second bucket I think of Reddit and Glassdoor and Quora, Tripadvisor, a great example, Pinterest. In the first bucket is the way to generate pages. Basically, it's editorially write content and have people write things for you. Is that generally the strategy?

Luc Levesque (00:46:07):
There's different ways of doing it, but a good content strategy is a kind of tried and true approach. Definitely.

Lenny (00:46:13):
And in that bucket of you don't naturally have a ton of pages, can you primarily grow through SEO? Or is SEO always going to be this minority channel and you have to find something else?

Luc Levesque (00:46:24):
No, it can be a big channel. This is also about creating content, but it's not your users creating the content. You have to go create the content and have some high quality answer to a question that's being asked on Google. I think one thing to keep in mind with SEO is entire industries are based off of single keywords. I remember when I was in the travel industry that literally companies were bought and sold based on one keyword rank. So it's not like, "Oh, it's a little bit of traffic." And I think this is a bit unintuitive with growth. A lot of people, they'll think of growth as linear or it's another channel, it's another thing. I mean, growth done right is exponential. It literally is company changing.

Luc Levesque (00:47:00):
When you're talking specifically about SEO, keep in mind the world is searching for that thing, targeted on that one keyword and likely you're clicking the number one search result. So getting that number one spot is not like, "Oh, that's a little bit of traffic." You can literally build an entire business around that first spot. So don't think that's... Well, maybe it is commonly known, I'm not sure, but it's definitely something that is non-obvious or intuitive I think to most people. And if you have an entire SEO team working on one keyword, I don't think that's crazy because a small number of keywords can define an entire industry or a business.

Lenny (00:47:37):
Is there an example of that sort of situation when keyword's building a massive company?

Luc Levesque (00:47:41):
Yeah, I mean there's a lot I'm sure. I can speak to my own company that I sold to Tripadvisor. It was called TravelPod. It was a travel blogging website where you can think WordPress, but for travel, which I started earlier. It was the first site to do that. I made the mistake of not knowing SEO or growth before I sold the company. And so that was a great learning for me. When I went in, this is a story where we're looking to acquire another site and I thought the product was pretty poor. I remember talking to the founder and thinking... He'd asked me if we'd want to acquire it, and, "The product's terrible. Why would I want to acquire that?" He's like, "Yeah, they're 10 times bigger than you." And, "What?" That was when I realized, "Okay, we've been building a great product and great engineering culture and it is important, but you really need to know this growth stuff." So that's actually the moment I shifted to, "All right, we have to really know these growth levers."

Luc Levesque (00:48:34):
In that space, the number one keyword was Travel Blog. And so owning that was a big deal and we did not own it. I think we ranked number two for a really long time. I can't remember if we got it in the end, but that's just one example where... And there was many, many travel businesses where I always loved looking at a business and trying to figure out, "What's their growth loop? How did they do that?" And it's not like, "Oh, it's a great business. It just grew." Most of the time it's price line crushed it at SEM. Facebook crushed it at a viral loop where you got tagged in a photo, you got an email and you had to go register because there's a photo of you somewhere you really want to see. Tripadvisor did a great job at SEO. In [inaudible 00:49:14], it's just one really strong channel that propelled the company forward. And in this case, it can literally come down to one keyword like we had at TravelPod.

Lenny (00:49:20):
So maybe it's a good time just to give a people a mental model of the different channels/loops that exist. So you've talked about SEO is one, paid search is one. What's the collection for people to think about? Usually as you said, one of the use is the primary source of growth for a company.

Luc Levesque (00:49:38):
Yeah, there's a variety of them. I think you have to look at where the intent is right now. It does change over time, but you have social channels like TikTok, Instagram. Influencers are a great area to engage with there. You have SEO, you have search. I think ChatGPT is another upcoming one that we might want to talk about a little bit where I do think we've never seen that kind of growth for search before and that's a platform that we have to start thinking about how do we optimize for it. Google just announced there are recent changes. They're going to be putting in an AI box at the top, the searchers also, how do you optimize in a world where it's not so much about optimizing for the platform, but teaching the AI what you do and why you're the best in the world at it. So that's another whole area that we could talk about, but that's a big channel I think that that's growing.

Luc Levesque (00:50:29):
Viral loops are always a powerful thing if you can get them to work. That's more about psychology and channel optimization, where you want people to be incentivized to share the product that you have with their friends and then to have their friends come back and register. So you can have one viral loop, you can have secondary viral loops, you can bolt viral loops on your existing products. There's different ways of doing this. And then just backing up. When I think about growth, I don't think about a specific... It's not growth equals SEO and Instagram. For me, growth equals whatever it takes to move the needle. So I get this question all the time, "How do you build a growth team? What does a growth team do?" And I say whatever it takes. That could be zero to one building a new product. It could be M&A, it could be SEO, it could be social, it could be onboarding.

Luc Levesque (00:51:15):
I think that's a better framework to look at. And then if you look at it through that lens, then partnerships easily folds into that where I've seen a lot of businesses get very big on just really clever partnerships, either strategic or broad kind of affiliate based partnerships. So there's a lot of channels. I definitely wouldn't restrict the scope of a growth team to just a small subset, but have a very wide funnel or at least strategy in terms of just test a lot of different things and go after the channels that work and pivot when it does, and then really lean into the one or two or three that really work because sometimes that's all it takes for business.

Lenny (00:51:50):
Well, you definitely nerd sniped me with the ChatGPT, so let's just spend some time there. I think this relates to just the general sense that SEO is always changing and it feels like this is an SEM I guess in this case too. And ChatGPT and Bard, I guess, is maybe the latest change. So what should we know there?

Luc Levesque (00:52:05):
Yeah, I think we're all still trying to figure it out. I was at Google IO last week or the week before. As soon as I saw the search result with the big box of AI, answers at the top, having done this for so long, I immediately knew the impact that I think is about to come. I've seen this play out in travel where Google acquired ITA and did flight search and hotel search. Generally, it's great for users and great for Google and the search engines, but makes it a little bit difficult for the publishers and the sites that are adding value to the ecosystem through being ranked in search results.

Luc Levesque (00:52:42):
So what we're about to see is basically Google, what they showed was a big box on top of the search results that answers the query directly. So if you think about that, that means that there's a lot of queries right now that users are clicking through down on the organic links and getting their answer there, which will be answered directly in the search result. We've seen this play out over the last five to 10 years where more and more answers are being shown at the top. Every time something changes, entire industries are disrupted or are changed. And I think that's going to happen again.

Luc Levesque (00:53:14):
So there's different types of keywords. There's transactional ones like e-commerce keywords with purchase intent. There's navigational ones where you're trying to get somewhere. And there's informational keywords, which is, "I have a question. I'm looking for an answer." It's pretty broad. It's a big area. I think that last category of keywords is particularly at risk. So if anybody listening to this is currently getting traffic on those, you should start thinking about what does that mean when things start changing. And I think the changes will be... We'll probably start seeing things shift to paid. You have to pay for that free traffic.

Luc Levesque (00:53:47):
The second one is there may just be a case where those keywords just don't get many clicks anymore. You might drop down to a very small number of clicks, if at all, because questions will get answered directly in the search results. So it's a big shift. We have to see how things land, but that's, I think over the next 12 to 24 months, if history repeats itself, we'll see that channel change. We've seen this play out in all the different channels. They kind of evolve generally. You can't blame the companies are doing what they have to do. ChatGPT is now 50% of my daily searches and not Google. So I think Google has to react and this is what we'll see. So from a growth perspective, definitely something to start to think about.

Lenny (00:54:25):
Super fascinating. I think about my newsletter and now Google suck it all up and just tell you all the answers. Great. Good news for me.

Luc Levesque (00:54:33):
[inaudible 00:54:34].

Lenny (00:54:39):
Yeah. Yeah. And change is great. Things don't-

Luc Levesque (00:54:41):
It's exciting. It's exciting. I'm just geeking out on growth a little bit, we haven't had a big platform change in a long time. So I'm like, "All right, cool. Let's go see what we can do here. How do you optimize this? How do you get listed if you can?" We're not sure where the placements will be, but that will be the new game.

Lenny (00:54:58):
Yeah, there's actually a lennybot.com that is a GPT bot trained on my content that there's a newsletter post about how it was all built so you could build your own. And so I think my new goal is going to have to convince people to go to lennybot.com instead of Google. Wish me luck.

Luc Levesque (00:55:15):
Hey, you got to lean into it. Yeah, we have a shop.ai, this great AI-based shopping engine. And I'll tell you, I bought so much on it. It's so good. The more you use these technologies, the more you realize how good they are. And that's something biggest coming. It's not just, "Oh yeah, there's another change." I was summarizing the Google change is to some people and originally was thinking this is the biggest change in the last 10 years. And then when I reflected on the last 10 years, I thought this is actually the biggest change since the inception of Google actually. I don't think we've seen something as profound as what's coming. And you really need to get ready for it.

Lenny (00:55:52):
Yeah, I've been using ChatGPT for helping me with interview questions actually, and once in a while there's like a really good one.

Luc Levesque (00:55:59):
Oh, that's cool.

Lenny (00:56:00):
So thank you ChatGPT, bringing me good things also. Maybe one more question along these lines around kind of connecting advisorship in SEO. Would you suggest when you're starting to think about SEO, starting to invest in SEO, you might be listening to this feeling like, "I got to think about SEO," does it make sense to bring on, say, SEO advisor like you? I know you're not available currently, but other folks like you or are an agency that is really good at this stuff or bring on someone full time? Do you have any kind of frameworks for thinking about which direction to go?

Luc Levesque (00:56:30):
It's hard for an agency or a pure advisor without internal help to do a really good job without internal talent at the center. So I would say I would start with just hire somebody internally and give them the mandate and incentivize them correctly to go and own this channel. Even if they don't know SEO, my advice would be get an engineer, get somebody who is just a relentless doer who wants to learn this and surround them with great advisors that I've just seen that work really well.

Luc Levesque (00:56:59):
There are some good agencies out there. Agencies will be working with multiple companies, so it's a little bit harder to get the same impact from an agency. It can work sometimes. But my preference is generally a last resort would be an agency. And I'd much rather have somebody who's internal who knows the business, who knows the keywords, who can have the knowledge internally inside the company permanently and help grow a team around them and have succession in place and a proper team so that you're not too dependent on this one person. But that would be my go-to. And then if you're really stuck, you can use agencies, but my default would be having somebody internal supplemented with agencies if you have to. Sorry, SEO is very specific. I mean, it's a very tight channel that knowing certain things about it can have a big impact. I think you do want people that have that experience that can bring that in from the outside to augmenting internal teams. It'll take a really long time to learn it.

Lenny (00:58:01):
Awesome. I was going to ask that. So you ideally want to find someone that's done it before that isn't just a relentless learner, but is that plus, has done SEO in the past?

Luc Levesque (00:58:08):
Oh, yeah. Ideally, you hire an amazing SEO person who can bring internal. Second would be somebody amazing who can get things done, surround them with advisors. And then in my stack rank, the third would be agencies.

Lenny (00:58:20):
Awesome. And then the other kind of common issue with SEOs, it takes a long time to show impact. Do you have just a rule of thumb of just give them this much time to see if they can make an impact?

Luc Levesque (00:58:29):
I'd say a few things. I'd say if you already have content and pages that are pretty good and getting a decent amount of traffic, it doesn't necessarily have to take a long time. So that would be my first reaction. It can take a long time. Generally, it takes a long time when you have to build new content. So the way to think about Google is it is going to take your content, it's going to show it to its users, people that are searching, and it's going to determine which piece of content is the best to ranked highly. It's not just about little tricks and links and keyword ratios. Those days are over. Those do matter, but it's not purely about that. And if you have a new piece of content, it takes time for Google to build enough trust to say, "Okay, I'm going to start showing this to users now" and then start collecting user feedback and then rank it appropriately. That can take some time.

Luc Levesque (00:59:14):
But if you have existing pages that are ranking eight and they're already on the first page, it doesn't always happen. But I've certainly seen it, in fact more common than not that you could have sometimes hundreds of percentages of lift very quickly. And it depends what you're starting with, is probably the right way to think about it. So if I'm trying to summarize it, I would say 12 months is probably max. If you can't see impact in 12 months, there's something wrong. If you have existing content, it could happen pretty early. It could happen on day one. Actually I've seen that happen. If you have to build new parts of the site, it can take months. I've seen that happen in companies I've worked with where I think it would be like a quarter, we had to wait till we saw a big lift. So it's somewhere between three to 12 months.

Lenny (01:00:05):
Awesome. That's really helpful. Okay, so final topic/final question. You've had a truly incredible career. You've worked with incredible companies, incredible leaders. I'm looking at your site here in a site window and you're like, here's a picture of you and Zuck. Here's a picture of you and Toby from Shopify, and there's more. I'm curious what you believe has been key to your success and your career success that you suggest listeners who want to have some measure of similar success do.

Luc Levesque (01:00:36):
It's probably a bunch of things we could talk about here. Yeah, this is the obvious thing is I think you've just got to love what you do. You got to work hard. You have to have impact. Certainly at the end of the day in growth, that's all that will matter. If I think back to specific things that I do though to pick one thing that's been very important for me throughout my journey is the art of self-reflection. And coaches. I've had coaches my whole career. But the macro theme is you're constantly iterating, experimenting, and becoming the best you can be in your career also as a dad and as a husband, and of course for your own personal health. But that reflection is so important. I've leveraged many, many different coaches over the years and now do a lot of self-reflection through a morning routine that I have and that I've been doing for quite some time that has been a big unlock for me.

Luc Levesque (01:01:32):
The biggest, most important part of that morning routine is dedicating an hour aside to really think about, "What's going well? What's not going well? What am I screwing up? Well, why am I screwing it up?" Which is often more important than, "What am I screwing up?" And of course, "What am I going to do about it?" But as long as you're learning and iterating every day, then you're just making constant progress towards your goals. It's something I do that I love doing. I love thinking. So I literally can just sit there and think for hours actually. I have a dashboard on all the areas that I'm focusing on with red, yellow, green, and just constantly revving on what am I working on improving, what am I doing, what experiments am I running and where am I doing well and where am I not doing well and how can I be better in all areas of my life, including being a leader. There's a lot of different things to it, but I think that's really important and something that I've learned over the years that is probably the most valuable to have as a skill.

Lenny (01:02:32):
I definitely want to spend more time on this. So you said you sit for an hour reflecting on what's going well, what's not going well. Is there more you can share about how you accomplish that, how you find time to do this for an hour?

Luc Levesque (01:02:43):
Yeah, it sounds crazy when you say it, but I do. So I wake up at 5:00. I work out. So I do cardio, I do some exercise. There's this great book called Spark, which is all around the neuroscience of exercise and I really learned a lot from that in terms of having this great morning routine that really boots you up. I kind of call it my bootloader. When I start in the day, if I go through my bootloader, I have just a much better day.

Luc Levesque (01:03:09):
So exercise, stretching, meditation, and then I do a cold plunge now. So I do a bunch of different things. But then I do some reading, but I do carve aside one hour where I go through... And this is probably important and it's where I've landed, but structured self reflections. That's why I have this dashboard. I have certain areas that I think about what's going well, what's not. I track all the experiments I'm writing. I'm just really passionate about if you're going to do something, try to do it as best as you can. This is a habit that has allowed me to sharpen my skills in certain areas.

Lenny (01:03:47):
What are some of these things you're working on? If you can share what's on this dashboard, how can people imagine what this might be?

Luc Levesque (01:03:53):
So there's a lot of personal stuff on it, but it literally is broken down between being a better friend, better husband, better dad, and then better leader. And so on the personal side, I've been known to work a lot of times. Balance is always hard to find. From being a dad and then thinking about how to be better there, I realized about six months ago that I've never actually asked for feedback on how I'm doing. So I asked my kids six months ago, I asked both of them independently, "What's one thing I can do to do more of or do less of to be a better dad?" And they were kind of caught off guard by it. My son's 15 and my other son is 12. And I said, "Take some time to think about it." And after about a month, my son came back and said, "Dad, I got one." He said, "I want to spend more time with you."

Luc Levesque (01:04:53):
So that was very helpful for me to hear. I'm big on routines and habits to make sure that things that you want to do are repeatable and it's not one-off things. So ever since that day, I've now have a daddy date if you want to call it. But every two weeks we do one-on-one time together with each of the boys. They get to pick what we do just so we have that consistent, whether it's dinner or play basketball in the front. But it's all about feedback. So that's one example on the personal side.

Lenny (01:05:27):
This reminds me of a tweet I just saw where someone said that the only people that are going to remember that you worked late for many nights is your kids.

Luc Levesque (01:05:37):
Wow. Wow. That's deep. I like that a lot.

Lenny (01:05:43):
As a soon to be parent, that's going to stick with me.

Luc Levesque (01:05:46):
Wow, I like that a lot. So it's tough, right? It's tough to balance it all out. It's very difficult because you want excel at everything you do in life. So that reflection helps, be it check-in as well of how am I doing in all these areas? And that I find the color coding is helpful for that too, of just doing a bit of a gut check and asking for that feedback.

Lenny (01:06:06):
So it also makes me think about, I was watching a Jeff Bezos interview and ask him what his morning routine was and he said that he just likes to putter around. he likes to just sit around, talk to his kids, read the newspaper. He doesn't book any meetings in the morning. He just finds he just needs a little flex time at the beginning.

Luc Levesque (01:06:22):
Totally. Before I became a dad, I read somewhere that one of the most impactful things you can do as a father is just be there for dinner every night. So I have been there for 15 years every single night. But it was a good reminder it's not enough. Having dinner is important with your family, but in our case there's more you can do. And just getting that feedback and doing some reprioritization is always important.

Lenny (01:06:46):
Speaking of dinners, and maybe just as a last question, I know you do this really interesting thing where you have dinners with interesting people. You just kind of invite them to your house. I don't know if interesting is the right way to describe it, but just kind of interesting people, prominent people. Can you just talk about what that is and what you think about and the benefits of doing something like that?

Luc Levesque (01:07:04):
I think interesting is the right way to think about it.

Lenny (01:07:05):
Okay.

Luc Levesque (01:07:07):
I started this when I was in Ottawa with a bunch of founders there. It's become one of my favorite things to do. Honestly, it's like the bright spot in my month that, I call them guilds. So the word guild is with the builders. That's how it originally started. So Guild Night is what I call it. The idea is basically all interesting people doing interesting things actually want to spend time with each other. That's why I'm actually surprised more people don't do this. But I'll basically have interesting people come, usually five or six. We'll sit around talking about specific topics. So I do one for consumer product, I do one for SEO, I do one for growth leaders and just have really smart, interesting people come and we'll talk about different topics that are relevant.

Luc Levesque (01:07:57):
Sometimes we'll pick a topic, so we'll have a group and then we'll say, "Hey, we want to talk about AI." So one of the advantages of being in the Bay Area is you can find three or four people that likely wrote some of the core code in Google or in AI, and then they'll join. People want to meet. People want to get together and have these conversations. So it's very exhilarating. I learn a ton. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why more people don't do it. And it's a bit of work to organize, but it's also just tactically been a great way to meet fascinating people. It's helped a lot for recruiting, for if you need a back channel. Now you know all these people that are in different industries. But business aside, they're very valuable business wise, but they're just a lot of fun and they've become some of my favorite things that I do.

Luc Levesque (01:08:43):
I'm really surprised why more people don't do it because I think especially now that everybody's remote and we're working from home, or most people are, it's more valued than ever. So it's something I'm looking forward to continuing and always actually through my morning reflection, thinking about what are new ones I can spin up who are interesting people that we want to break bread with. I do think it's important that it's done at your house. If anybody's thinking of starting this, you can do it at a restaurant, but there's something about being in your home or being in somebody's home, five or six people having a great conversation about a topic that's mutually interesting. I think everybody values it and it adds a lot of spice to life. I think it's really important.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Any other tactical tips for making one of these happen? So you do it at your home, you cater. How many people? How long? Anything else you want to share there?

Luc Levesque (01:09:31):
Yeah, so I think the most I've done is 10. That's a bit too much. Six seems to be perfect, six to eight, eight at the max. I do get a catered so you don't have to worry about cooking. The topic, something like a topic that it's common so that everybody can rally around. I do think it's important, like I mentioned, doing it at home. Usually we start around 6:00, we go till 9:00 or 10. It's just been a really good thing that I've learned over time is a really good thing to do to just make for a better life, frankly. Make richer life with some great friends.

Lenny (01:10:08):
And when we say cater, it's just ordering in basically, right? It's not that-

Luc Levesque (01:10:11):
Yeah, you can just DoorDash some food so you don't have to worry about cooking. I'm sure there's other things. I've never really deeply thought about it, but in terms of what are the specific things, I've evolved it over time, but I don't cook anyways, so it would be terrible if I cooked. So this is much easier to do it this way. And as long as you're inviting kind of interesting people, everybody's going to want to come and spend some time and bring some bread.

Lenny (01:10:33):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Luc Levesque (01:10:39):
I think so.

Lenny (01:10:40):
I think you are. Well, question one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Luc Levesque (01:10:47):
So there's one that I've already mentioned, which is Spark. It's the neuroscience of exercise. That's a great book. It's not one of these exercise to stay fit and to live longer. This is really about, frankly, if you exercise and do it in a specific way, they have a kind of blueprint they lay out, it's good for just cognition and kind of horsepower and performance. So that's been a really important one and has been a big part of me building on my morning routine. The second one is when I picked up I think about a year ago or six months, and I recommended it, gee, I don't know, at least to a couple hundred people now because I recommended it to my team. It's called Smart Brevity. Have you heard of this one?

Lenny (01:11:31):
No, but I love the sound of it.

Luc Levesque (01:11:33):
I've always been big on writing crisply and being very tight and not having three-page memos that you're sending off. Especially now that we're remote and we're all doing slack and email and different ways of messaging, how tightly you communicate, how crisp your communication is really important for frankly you getting your point across and also for the other person who's probably digesting a hundred of these messages. So this book is... It's a book on how to do that. It breaks down how to write crisply and the different parts of it. I've definitely seen improvements in the team since I've passed around. So that's a great book frankly for anybody, work or personal because we're writing so much and communication is so key. So that's the second one. The third one is a golden oldie. It's one that I've read many, many times and I recommend from a growth perspective. This one youlikely heard of, it's Influence by Cialdini.

Lenny (01:12:28):
I got it back on my bookshelf there.

Luc Levesque (01:12:30):
Yeah, it's a great book, and it's because it's really the underpinning of so many different product and growth principles that you can apply. So that's just a classic that is good to reread at least once a year. So those are three books.

Lenny (01:12:42):
I'm going to extend this a little bit. I'm going to add two books that are building on your two books, or the first two books, I guess. One is Peter Attia just wrote a book called Outlive. That is-

Luc Levesque (01:12:50):
I've got to read it.

Lenny (01:12:51):
Okay. And it's exactly the same kind of premise of just how important exercise is. I think there's a quote in there of just the only thing proven to help you live longer is exercise. And then Smart Brevity, there's another book that I'd recommend if people want more on though on this topic called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Luc Levesque (01:13:07):
[inaudible 01:13:08].

Lenny (01:13:08):
And it's by the guy that wrote the War of Art and Bagger Vance. I forget his name off the top of my head, but it's like, "Nobody wants to read your shit. Here's what you need to do for people to want to read anything you're writing."

Luc Levesque (01:13:23):
Yeah. We want to scan. We want to read. Yeah, that's great. I'll pick that one up. Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Lenny (01:13:27):
Exactly. What a title.

Luc Levesque (01:13:29):
That's a great title.

Lenny (01:13:31):
All right, back on track. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Luc Levesque (01:13:36):
I don't watch TV much and I haven't really watched any movies in a while. But I do watch a lot of podcasts on YouTube. Andrew Huberman has got, of course, a great series. I've watched I think everyone he puts out, so I don't know if that counts, but that's-

Lenny (01:13:49):
Absolutely

Luc Levesque (01:13:50):
Okay. So I watched that. And then of course the All-In Podcast is always fun, so I make sure to watch those when they come out as well. A lot of fun and informative. So those are my two, I would say.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Great picks. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Luc Levesque (01:14:06):
Teach me something about growth that I don't already know. Because... and you could apply this to engineering product, any other area, because it really gives you a sense of what this person thinks is the top of the stack in terms of the smartest thing they know. Whether you know it or not is irrelevant. But sometimes you actually do end up learning some stuff. But it's my favorite question because you can really engage in a conversation around, "Okay, the thing you think is so unique that maybe you've come up with this learning yourself or you've created this tactic and then it gives you a sense of how much they know the craft." So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:14:42):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love?

Luc Levesque (01:14:46):
I've got a cold plunge that I bought that I love. So it's called the Renew Cold Plunge. It's cold but super convenient and I do that every morning and I just love it.

Lenny (01:14:58):
Any advice for cold plunging? That sounds very painful and hard.

Luc Levesque (01:15:01):
I usually start going... I go in a hot tub to warm up, then I go in the cold plunges and back in the hot tub. That's an easy way to get started. But I will say I jumped in yesterday and today without going to hot tub. It was very painful, but I felt so much better after. So I might be changing up my approach, but I'm just kind of experimenting with different things. But that would be some advice. And then just go slow. Start it not too cold, and then slowly make it cold over time. But I think it's a pretty good thing to add in so far.

Lenny (01:15:31):
How long have you spent in the cold plunge?

Luc Levesque (01:15:33):
It varies. Right now I'm doing five minutes. Five minutes at, I think it's 53 degrees. So I've started at 60, slowly bringing it down. But you do have to go slow because I brought it down even further and kind of caught me off guard and got a little dizzy. So you got to find your sweet spot.

Lenny (01:15:53):
Damn. Very Huberman inspired. I imagine this-

Luc Levesque (01:15:57):
Definitely it was part of the source there.

Lenny (01:15:59):
I know people would hear a lot about cold plunges. I guess what have you seen as a benefit just while we're on this topic for people to seriously consider doing this?

Luc Levesque (01:16:06):
So a couple things. Mood afterwards is so much better. You get this great multi-hour boost from doing it. Especially like I mentioned, not doing warm before or waiting 10 minutes and waiting 10 minutes after before you warm up, after you get out, great mood boost. It also helps a lot with sleep. So if you do it at night, which is a little bit difficult, it helps a lot with sleep. Those are probably the two biggest things. And you do get to a point, I'm there now where I kind of look forward to it because you know how good you'll feel afterwards. So when I'm thinking about it, I know it's painful, it doesn't make it easier, but I do look forward to it now. It's a pretty cool thing.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Oh man. I got to get one now.

Luc Levesque (01:16:46):
Yeah. [inaudible 01:16:49].

Lenny (01:16:49):
Okay, two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Luc Levesque (01:16:56):
One change that comes to mind is it's common to hear discussion around you need to experiment, you need to have rigor, you need to look at results, iterate based on those results. That's pretty much common knowledge is how all good companies that execute growth that do it. I think the subtlety is that experiments are great, but they can be slow. You have to look at the results. You have to analyze how things went. You have to learn what's going on. You have to build the experiment. So there's a cost to an experiment and not everything needs to be experimented. And that's not something that I generally hear growth teams talk about. It's usually, "Hey, we need to experiment."

Luc Levesque (01:17:40):
So one thing that we're definitely focused more on lately is this idea of sometimes you just need to YOLO it because it's a better product experience or you just kind of know it's going to work. And if you're YOLO-ing 40 things and three of them work and you can look at pre-post, you can look at holdouts, there's ways of making sure you don't cause major damage, but the speed can outweigh the cost and time it takes to do experiment. So that's one change we've recently implemented. That's been pretty impactful.

Lenny (01:18:09):
Final question. So we met actually a long time ago in Montreal, or maybe it was in Ottawa, in Canada somewhere. I think it was through an organization called C100 when I was starting my company back in the day. And so my question is, what is your favorite Canadian food?

Luc Levesque (01:18:24):
It's funny. My favorite Canadian food, I'm from Ottawa and there's a lot of shawarma, Lebanese shawarma everywhere. I know it's not traditionally Canadian, but Canada's so multicultural, so I'll make this count. I love a good shawarma and it's so hard to find a good shawarma in the Bay Area. We've still been looking here. But my favorite Canadian food or pseudo Canadian is shawarma. If I had to pick one purely Canadian food, and this is related to Montreal where we first met, it's got to be a Montreal smoked meat sandwich.

Lenny (01:18:58):
Excellent choices. You're making me very hungry. I'm going to go get some shawarma, buy me a cold plunge. Luc, this was amazing. We talked through everything I was hoping to talk through. Advisorships, SEO, hiring, building habits, cold plunges. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Luc Levesque (01:19:18):
You can find me online at luclevesque.com. So first name, last name.com. And how can they be useful to me? Listen, we're always looking to hire the best of the best. So if you want to work at an amazing company with an amazing team doing very impactful work and learn the craft of growth, please reach out. We're always looking to bring on amazing talent. So that would be the woodway.

Lenny (01:19:40):
Awesome. Luc, thank you again so much for being here.

Luc Levesque (01:19:43):

# Gain attention as an underdog with this framework | Lulu Cheng Meservey

## Transcript

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:00:00):
I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:00:33):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:01:18):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Lulu Meservey. I met Lulu while she was head of comms at Substack, where she was infamous for taking big risks and bold stands, and as a result creating a lot of attention for Substack, and other companies she's represented. Lulu is definitely the most innovative and interesting comms person I've worked with.

(00:01:46):
She's currently executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief communications officer at Activision Blizzard. And she writes what I'd say is the best newsletter on PR and comms strategy, a newsletter called Flack. In our conversation we get tactical about how to make your idea spread, cultural erogenous zones, the growing importance of going direct versus relying on traditional media. The importance of taking risks in your comms and much more. Lulu is so insightful, I could have continued to explore the subject for hours. Enjoy this episode with Lulu Meservey after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. They recently launched Conformer-1, the largest trained speech recognition model on the market which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All of AssemblyAI's models, which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:02:54):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now is the time to check out AssemblyAI with their new Conformer-1 model available today, which makes it even easier to bring the highest accuracy transcription to your customers just like Spotify, CallRail and Writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground, that's assemblyai.com/lenny.

(00:03:28):
This episode is brought to you by Public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash, that is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, and you can access your cash whenever you want even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield.

(00:04:10):
Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury account at public.com/lenny. Lulu welcome to the podcast.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:04:39):
Thank you Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:41):
I am really excited to chat all things comms and PR. I've never met a founder or product leader who doesn't want to get better at spreading ideas and getting their product out there, and you're very good at this. We're going to talk about some of the things you've done in the space. But just to start maybe just broadly I'm curious to hear just what have you learned about what helps an idea spread?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:05:03):
So there's a few ways to make the idea spread, the overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition. And so what doesn't make them want to say it is doing a favor for a corporation. What does make them want to say it is they want to bring joy to somebody else, they want to make somebody laugh, they want to appear interesting, or they want to project some part of their identity. And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat. You can use an analogy, you can take something and just say it over and over, move fast and break things, don't be evil, build something people want.

(00:05:47):
You can create a mental image that is very colorful. So I have a mental image for people that I use a lot, which is put the pill in some cheese and we can talk about it later, it's about how to craft a story that will stick. But when I say put the pill in cheese, people tend to remember that and it's more easily repeatable. And then the last thing is use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people. So if you give them a story that's something they can repeat over the dinner table.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Do you have any examples of the frameworks you just shared? So you talked about maybe having an analogy or putting the pill in the cheese, which I think is referring to when you feed a dog a pill. You want to hide the pill in the cheese. Is there any stories or examples that come to mind of this in action either something you've done or other companies you've seen?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:06:34):
One example not for the better is binders of women. You remember when Mitt Romney said binders of women and it just absolutely caught on like wildfire, and it's because you can picture the binder, it's a hilarious mental image. You make lots of jokes about it. It's a very specific unusual phrasing that is very repeatable, and it lends itself so much to memeing. So it's not something that they wanted to have happen, which is a word of caution, this can backfire on you as well, but that's an example. I mentioned move fast and break things, software is eating the world, it's time to build. Those are these short phrases that take normal words and put them in an unusual order, and then especially if you repeat them a few times they just become very sticky.

Lenny (00:07:19):
These things sound really smart and wise after the fact, do you have any advice on just how to... So we're talking about coming up with a cool phrase that'll spread of how to do that. I don't know what have you seen work for coming up with move fast and break things, how would a founder approach that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:07:35):
You want to make it something that a second-grader could understand. You want to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient. So it should be something where they're not having to expend any extra energy understanding the thing, where it immediately paints a picture. Or if you were to make a joke, it has to be a joke that they immediately get, or it's a very widely understood reference. You don't want it to be this inside joke with yourself that other people might get if you explain it to them. So if you were to boil down the essence of let's say your company or your mission, get it to one sentence and then turn it into a sentence that you could explain to a second-grader, and then cleanse it of all cliches and common parlance. And if you can then turn that into an analogy or if you can make it into something that has imagery, then you're probably 80, 90% of the way there.

Lenny (00:08:36):
So you've definitely done this on Twitter. It might be fun just to share a tweet or something of yours that has done this that has spread like crazy. I noticed you delete your old tweets, which I think is really smart and I should probably do that. So I couldn't find any examples, but I remember just being like, "Holy shit, it's got a bazillion views." Is there there an example that comes to mind that you could share? Just share something you put out that just went crazy.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:09:00):
I actually have a negative example too. I think it's useful to share my mistakes or missteps in addition to what went right, because there's more mistakes and missteps than what goes right. In general, you try a bunch of things every once in a while they succeed. But I think it's useful to think about what didn't land. And so one of mine was when you might remember this because this was the Substack era, when we were taking a lot of incoming for not censoring enough, and we took a stand that we want to encourage free expression. I was actually on maternity leave, so I was a little bit out of the loop, but I wanted to jump in there and support the cause. And so I did a thread about why we're standing by this principle even when it's hard, and the thread was pretty well received, it traveled a lot.

(00:09:53):
I think it was 30 something thousand likes among people that we cared about, people who write on the internet. And then there was one tweet in the thread where I said something like, "Doing this isn't pleasant, but neither for that matter is the sea." Completely esoteric reference, it was fresh in my mind because it was from a New Yorker book review where in that context it was poetic and evocative and beautiful. And I did the thing you're not supposed to do, which is take an inside joke with yourself and release it into the world.

(00:10:33):
And that one tweet was a dud in the middle of the thread where you could see the likes drop off precipitously and people were like, "What are you talking about?" And then afterwards I looked at it with fresh eyes, "Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever out of a context." And also I'm not a New York book reviewer, so that was a good don't. But the fact that it was such a colorful metaphor actually caught people's attention in an accidental way. I didn't mean for it too. I guess that's a don't, does that serve as an example?

Lenny (00:11:08):
Yeah, that'll work and we'll go through other examples. But that's a good segue to something I was going to save for later, but it may be a good time to chat about is just something that you're big on is this concept of taking risks as a comms person, I think you have the sense that comms people are just very conservative, and there's a big opportunity to get a little out there. And in this case maybe it didn't work out, other times you have and it has. So just talk about that philosophy you have around taking risks.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:11:34):
I think if you're a startup your enemy is the status quo. And when you don't take risks, when you minimize risk by doing nothing, the best way to minimize risk is to do nothing. You're letting the status quo win. You're letting your greatest enemy and rival and threat to your business win by default, because you're not even going to try to compete. And so I always encourage people to try to make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Because if you make a mistake of commission you can observe it, you can learn from it. You know right away that it's happened. You can move really quickly and adapt and become better.

(00:12:11):
Whereas if you make mistakes of omission you're letting status quo win, you're not observing, you're not learning, and you're maybe not even noticing opportunities slip by. So the example that I use, again, an analogy to make it more memorable, my analogy for this is if you are investing money in the market versus if you're just sitting in cash. If you're sitting in cash you won't lose your money and it feels safe. But over time the world moves and the market grows, and everybody else is getting richer and you're getting poorer in real terms. Whereas if you make an investment it'll go up and down, there'll be some volatility. It's not just going to go up every day, but over the long run you'll be much, much better off.

Lenny (00:12:54):
Is there an example of something you did that you took a risk and it worked out, or you saw someone else do this really well?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:13:00):
The stand for free speech thread would be a risk that worked out. It was a risk because it was a topic that a lot of people were already mad about, which will happen with every topic that matters. It felt a little risky for me because I was on leave, I wasn't really in the middle of things. I was addled already, so I had at least one thing in there that was nonsensical. So there was the execution risk of would I'd be able to do this well.

(00:13:29):
There was also the risk of you poke your head up and make a thing where there wasn't a thing, and if that were to go wrong and embarrass the company or if that had made Chris or Hamish or Jerraj upset, that would've been upsetting to me and obviously a failure of my job. So that was a risk that I took and we took and they were supportive, and it did work out because the people who were most likely to write on Substack generally appreciate that stance.

(00:14:00):
I actually have one more for you Lenny when you asked about what are things that help stick in people's memory, there was the fail example of the sea analogy. I think a useful example that works is I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones, and it is something that you immediately know what I'm talking about. If I say know your audience's cultural erogenous zones, you know what it means, it's a shorthand that everybody understands. It's not an inside joke with myself, and it's something that is unusual and upraising that you're going to repeat it and hopefully remember it, so there's one for you.

Lenny (00:14:40):
You told me about that framework and I definitely wanted to hear more about it. What does that mean and is there something that you've seen someone do that's just like, "Wow, they really nailed this erogenous zone approach."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:14:54):
Yeah, they really got it in the erogenous bull bullseye. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:15:26):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:16:09):
This makes me think about one of the other tweets that I think went crazy, which is where you share the things you're muting on Twitter. Where it's like the threads thimble and the pointing down thing, and it feels like that's exactly that where people are just like, "Yep, this is me."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:16:25):
Yeah, it is that. I have an example for you Lenny. The one that my mind goes to is when Kamala Harris was running for Senate. Put aside what anyone thinks of Kamala Harris as a politician or if you agree with her politics, it doesn't matter. When she was running for Senate, she had this example where not enough people care about K-12 education. It's not a sexy topic and only moms care about it, whereas people cared a lot and still do about national defense, national security.

(00:16:55):
And so she said the way to get their attention is you go to people who care about national security and you tell them, "Did you know that in order to enlist for the army you have to have a 10th grade reading level?" If you can't read at that level, you're not going to be able to read the army field manual. And so if you care about the future of national defense and being able to maintain a standing army, you need to care about middle grade reading standards. So that's a perfect example, and in fact it stuck with me such that many years later I'm still repeating it to you.

Lenny (00:17:28):
Something else that I think what you teach helps with is underdogs coming up against incumbent companies, giving them a chance to stand out. Like Substack I think is a good example where you just helped elevate Substack on the world stage in a lot of ways. What have you found works best for underdog startups and companies trying to get attention?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:17:49):
First, you have to acknowledge that you're the underdog, and you're not going to use the GE playbook from the 1980s or whatever. So acknowledging that means knowing that you're not going to play the game that requires you to have more resources, more and deeper relationships, and institutional backings, and to be able to draft off of the current narrative. So all of those things are going to be not in your favor. If you're a startup for example, by definition you're trying to disrupt something, you're trying to do something differently, you're fighting the status quo. And if that's the case then you can't rely on maybe the government, maybe mainstream media to support what you're doing. And so you should assume that you want to go with an approach that doesn't require a lot of money or people, that doesn't require that institutional backing and those relationships.

(00:18:40):
That means building your own distribution, which you can do starting from day one. You can start doing that before you even have the company. It means taking your story and winning hearts and minds. Number one, by making it a story that you shape to fit people's cultural erogenous zones of your audience. And number two, by finding the centers of gravity in society, like the influencers that are going to help spread it for you. Because you're not going to on day one call up the New York Times and get them to print the story that you want them to. So you need to figure out who are the influencers and the way to do that, I'll cut off the rabbit hole after this because you can just go deeper and deeper, but the way to do that is in concentric circles. There's a general who said if there's a problem I look for it in concentric circles going back to my own desk.

(00:19:33):
If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it. This is hard to do because you know too much, so out of the 1,000 facts in your head you're going to have to pick just between one and three. And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence.

(00:20:06):
But once you get the sequence and you identify who the people are and you know who your audience is, and then you're able to hone in on what their cultural erogenous zones are, then you're able to craft the message, have the delivery mechanisms, and then know your target, and then you're off. But you just need to do that exercise upfront, so you don't have a lot of wasted motion.

Lenny (00:20:25):
I really like this concentric circle framework. I haven't heard this before. Just to make it a little more real is there something that you can share, something that comes to mind that illustrates that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:20:36):
Well, you and I have talked a lot about Substack, so I'm speaking out of term now that I don't have the employee badge. But something that I thought the Substack founders have always done so well is propagate product updates out in concentric circles. So there's a lot of things where you're going to know about it. You, Lenny will know about it more than a new writer who just joined, because you're a power user of the product and they would want you... Now they would want to make sure that you love the thing, and that you feel maybe even a little bit invested in the thing. You've been telling people about recommendations for nearly a year. No one asked you to do that. We didn't pay you to do that. You've done it because you were brought on board early and it was something that the company made sure that you liked, and then you became the next circle out that spread it to your next circle out.

Lenny (00:21:33):
It's interesting because I didn't think of it as an intentional strategy to get news out, and it feels like there's a synergy with just talking to your power users. Getting feedback from your power users leads to this interesting second order effect where they also want to... they feel like they're on the inside of something, they want to share it and maybe talk about it and tell friends about, "Hey, Substack's working this cool thing." So that's kind of a cool-

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:21:53):
Well, early on Lenny you asked about how do you get a message to spread? And I said you give people incentives who want to spread it. So your incentive was you helping others, you like paying it forward and helping other writers and podcasters, and you genuinely enjoy the thing. And I think there's some value to your own project that you get to show social proof that a lot of people like this thing and it's growing, and that's what you got. If it had been like, "Hey, Lenny, can you do us a favor and tweet this thing?" You might've done it, but you would've done it once and stopped and it wouldn't have been something that you organically keep doing.

Lenny (00:22:30):
To make this even more real I'm trying to help people understand this concentric circle idea, so first Substack is an example. What would be the few layers of the concentric circle on the middle would be maybe the power writers. What would be the next couple layers?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:22:46):
It's the employees at the middle, almost always, and then it is depending on the company. So here it would be the power writers, it's youth, a lot of the original writers. Bill Bishop comes up a lot, he was Substacker number one, he's always really meaningful. And then it's fast growing writers. It is writer influencers. There are certain members of the media that cover media and writing, and so they matter a lot. And then investors are in there just to keep close to the fold.

(00:23:18):
But if you're a different kind of company that might be employees board, institutional investors, government and regulators then users, just depending on how much power each group has to influence your future. And the reason I say go out in concentric circles as opposed to just hit each of these groups kind of haphazardly is that's your way to control the message. Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle. So an example is if you and I have a company, Lenny and Lulu, this is a DTC startup.

Lenny (00:24:01):
That's a great name.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:02):
It is, we should do it.

Lenny (00:24:03):
We should do this.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:04):
If we had a company and we were trying to put out a message to the world that our new thing works, it's really revolutionary, our genes are the best genes. If employees are not saying that, then people are going to look at employees and say, "Well, they would know, they're closer to this than we are. So if they're not excited then why would we be excited?" And so that undermines everything that we're trying to do, you can't skip a circle is my point.

Lenny (00:24:32):
Super interesting. And I imagine the closer they are to the employees the more time you spend with them, and the more innately they're closer and also their perspective and what they share is more powerful because they're closer to what's happening.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:48):
And if it goes wrong the more damage they can do. So on the spectrum it's if they are not totally on board and they're not an effective messenger, versus they're just lukewarm and they're not really sure they believe it. All the way to they actively fell off the bandwagon and you lost them, and now they're out there proactively contradicting everything you say or even trying to destroy the company, that can happen. If an early employee, for example, feels disgruntled, which is easy to do and it's easy to do through a comms mistake. If you sell them on one thing and here's a vision, and now either that's changed or you miscommunicated. If they feel like there's a bait and switch they're going to be really mad. And now you've created someone who is incredibly credible and has the same social and professional circle as you and is trying to ruin you.

Lenny (00:25:44):
That's such a good point. For someone that's trying to do this maybe internally they're like, "Oh, cool, we got to create these circles for our startup." What do you recommend they do? Do they make a list of here's our inner circle, here's the next circle of people.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:25:56):
Yeah, you take out your one-page Google Doc. I feel like most comms problems can be solved with one-page Google Doc. So you go to your one-page Google Doc and you take your audiences, you list them, probably stop at five or six because past that it's like way, way first world problem. You'll have more than enough work to win over the five or six inner circles, and then you have to rank them. And you rank them by how much they're able to influence your success and how much credibility other groups assign them. So then you have your inner to outer circles.

(00:26:32):
And then for each of them you would think about what do they care about that's their cultural erogenous zones and where do they reside intellectually? So do they listen to podcasts, if so, which ones. Do they go to in-person conferences? Are they getting all of their news from Reddit? If so, which subreddits are they on Hacker News? Once you map that out, then again you have the people you're trying to reach, the ideas and messages that resonate the most with them, and then the ways to actually reach them.

Lenny (00:27:04):
This is becoming a real template we can start using. In the bucket of erogenous zones what are some examples of erogenous zones for people in this context?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:27:15):
We've talked about the free expression stand from last year. A lot of people care about first amendment, protecting press freedoms and free expression. Not a lot of people care that a journalist said something mean about Substack. And so there were a few times when we did have to push back publicly against a journalist saying something mean and unfair or untrue about Substack. So obviously my and our ulterior motive is to vindicate the company and show people that this isn't true. But if we had just done that, nobody would've cared or maybe a few diehards would've cared. There are people who care deeply about Substack, but not as many people and not as deeply as the people who care about their ability to express themselves freely or their right to build their own media platform without too many controls.

Lenny (00:28:20):
The way you described it earlier came back to me as you were talking, which is this idea that lights people up. What lights people up within this list of people that you're making? So that's really interesting. So the idea is create this list of people across circles further and further away from your employees. Think about what lights them up, what are their erogenous zones intellectually, and then think about where they spend their time intellectually, what are they listening to? What are they reading?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:44):
Yeah, that's it.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Amazing, this is super cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:47):
It's not easy, it's hard, you have to make very difficult tactical decisions every day when you're doing that, but it is simple.

Lenny (00:28:54):
Yeah, it seems pretty easy. Okay, this is great. Another framework that we haven't talked about yet, do you have this math formula for how ideas spread? Does that ring a bell?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:05):
Okay, let's get into that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:06):
I think it's useful to try to bring as much discipline as possible to comms, because you're really just measuring vibes. In a world of OKRs and data and metrics it's hard to know if you're doing the right thing with comms. And so I think whenever you're able to establish a framework its useful, so this one is kind of a mathematical formula of comms for a purpose. It assumes that you have a business goal and as a business goal, not communications goal, it's not get this many impressions or go viral or blah. It is we're going to grow our revenue by X, or we're going to make this penetration into this user base. When you have your business goal you're going to need certain people to do certain things for that goal to come true. So for example, you're going to need this type of person in this quantity to buy these sneakers in order for you to meet your revenue goal.

(00:30:07):
So now you know who the people are and the action they need to take. The next step is what do they need to believe in order to take that action? So they need to believe that their feet are not comfortable now, and that it's possible for their feet to be more comfortable and that'll have a positive effect on their life, and that this new sneaker technology is real, so they need to believe these things. Then it's where do they reside intellectually? How do you deliver that message to them, and that's the who do they listen to? Which accounts do they follow? Which podcast do they... what trips do they take? What newspapers, et cetera. And when you have that then you have the equation of we need to deliver this message to these people through these mediums in order to get them to do this thing with this call to action. And that way you know that you're at least pushing forward and getting something done with your comms as opposed to just saying words into the ether.

Lenny (00:31:11):
I think you had something like there's pressure and force and area, is that part of this or is that a different framework?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:17):
Different framework.

Lenny (00:31:18):
Oh, okay, cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:20):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:31:21):
Okay, okay, let's talk about this other framework too.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:24):
I've got more frameworks, Lenny.

Lenny (00:31:25):
I love it, this is what this podcast is all about. Let's do it.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:29):
This is a useful one for early stage startups especially, or anybody who's just trying to be lean and efficient, which is anyone who's an underdog like we talked about earlier, that if you decrease the surface area than with the same amount of force you can apply more pressure. So the amount of pressure is the force divided by the surface area, this is a basic equation for physics, but it's also true of communications, which is if you decrease the surface area and don't try to appeal to everybody with everything. And you're targeting exactly whom you're talking to and you are sharpening your message to a point, to get them in the bullseye of the cultural erogenous zone. Then you're able to with the same amount of effort or expense or time, you're able to make more of an impact, you're able to apply more pressure.

(00:32:30):
So I think of it as there's a continuum between you can either hyper-target, so the extreme of the continuum is you are becoming the life partner of one person. That's the ultra hyper targeting. And then the other end of the spectrum is you're appealing to everybody. You're appealing to a larger number of people, but with a weaker message, in a weaker way. So you could say world peace is good, nobody disagrees with that practically, but also it doesn't stick and it's not meaningful to them. So you have to choose where you're going to be along that continuum. And for most startups I would choose towards the fewer people end of it, where you choose who's going to be your diehards and then you foster them and create really deep meaningful relationships with them. And the way to do that is to decrease the surface area and apply more pressure.

Lenny (00:33:23):
It feels like you did that with Substack where it was focused on people writing online, or I guess tell me is that how you thought about it Substack of here's our little focused area and we'll focus target message to that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:33:37):
That was the goal and that's actually why I started spending time on Twitter. It was a very self-loathing exercise like Hamish doesn't like the Twitter model, nor do, we would talk about this a lot and I always felt a little bit fringe being on there. And before I worked at Substack I had a sleepy account of a couple hundred followers that didn't do very much. And I realized that the people that we were trying to speak to are heavy Twitter users, whether it's media people or online writers. And so I decided I'm going to spend some time and try to build an audience and then that audience became leverage, for better or worse. I don't think we should measure people by their Twitter following, but the fact is that if you have more then journalists and writers take you a bit more seriously. And so if I was going to try to carry a message on behalf of the company, I felt like it would be more effective if I had more people.

Lenny (00:34:38):
And it worked. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:35:18):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups, it's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:35:56):
Going back to this formula, pressure equals force divided by area. Basically, to increase the effectiveness of your message you can either increase the force and what is in this context force? Is it like the amount of messaging or is it the success of your message?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:36:11):
It's the amount of effort you put into it. So it's how much you are spending on this campaign or you have a limited amount of hours in the day and dollars in the bank. And so anytime you're doing something with comms, you're either paying the dollars or you're paying the time. Sometimes you're drawing down on credibility too, you have a certain amount of credibility and there are times when you just have to say, "Please trust me." You can spend that more efficiently if you focus. So instead of if you just take a simple ad campaign, instead of spending a million dollars to reach a million people, maybe you spend a $100 to reach the hundred most important people. And focus that message exactly to them so that when they see your ad they're actually going to click on it and they're actually going to forward it, and that's a much better return. And then you might end up with a million dollars worth of return, because those people were so passionate that they then became their own messengers without you even having to be involved anymore.

Lenny (00:37:12):
This is a really great framework, again, is your advice that for the smaller you are just basically reduce the area?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:37:22):
And the larger you are increase that over time?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:24):
Yes. If you're just starting out, get 10 diehards and just spend all your time... You can't start out and try to win over the general public. You start out by creating a tiny, not the best analogy is one I can think of right now, a tiny monopoly. And it's the same like succeeding on Substack or creating anything on the internet. You choose what is going to be your tiny corner of the internet that you are going to just dominate entirely. And the smaller it is, the more you can dominate it and then these people that are in it become your true believers, your diehards, and they'll expand it out to the next circle and then you go from there. But if you try to win over everybody at the same time, it's a food coloring in the ocean kind of thing as opposed to food coloring in a cup.

Lenny (00:38:17):
Is there an example that comes to mind of someone that did this really well? I don't know. I know it's hard to think of just an example off the top of your head, but does anything come to mind?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:38:25):
Balaji did this really well with his book The Network State, that book was super successful. He didn't do a lot of the traditional book tour New York Times stuff. He went his own route, and I think that was really smart if you're going to put it in the setting of this framework, it's he created his own distribution channels. He didn't try to compete with the roster of Harper Collins on their turf, and when he created his own distribution channels he focuses on who are the diehards and the truth fans, and these are people that he fosters. He goes on podcasts that reach these people. He doesn't deviate from messaging to try to appeal to everybody. There are people who just will never like that guy and he is totally fine with it. So he's not watering down who he is to appeal to people who will never like him, which it's tempting for companies to do.

(00:39:17):
You hate when people are mad at you, so you try to appeal to them and then your true fans lose their passion because the thing that made you so special has now gone milk toast. So Balaji fosters his true fans and then when the book launched they propelled him to the top of the Amazon list, because they were out there evangelizing, proselytizing. You probably saw all these tweets about his book. He didn't pay anybody as far as I know. He didn't pay anybody to do that. He just shared it with the people and they wanted to show that they were into this.

Lenny (00:39:46):
That's a great example. I know that founders often worry focusing too narrowly limits their market, and it's never going to grow into anything large. In your experience do you find that that's just often not true, that there's often a much bigger opportunity than they think? Or is that just a good way to start and then you expand from there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:40:03):
It's both. If you're writing online or doing something online, the denominator is the size of the internet. You don't need to capture 80% of it. If you capture 0.01% of it, that is a great business and then you can go from there. Once you've won that then you can decide to go from there and the world is a big place. So now that everything's digital the denominator's so large that I wouldn't worry too much about the numerator. But it is also true that if you start off trying to peel to too many people, you have to water down your stuff so much that you'll never stand out. And you've written about this Lenny with how to be viral, how to be noticed, and one of the things is be remarkable. And you can't be remarkable if you're trying to appeal to so many people that you have to become the average of 500,000 people's tastes.

Lenny (00:40:57):
This is a good way to think about I think when something's not working, when you're trying to get a bunch of attention for your product and no one cares. Feels like this is one reason is just you're going too wide.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:09):
Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason.

Lenny (00:41:14):
Maybe just thinking about diagnosing why your comms may not be working. This may be too big of a question, but just what other explanations could there be for why no one cares about what you're trying to put out?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:25):
You're doing it as a corporation instead of a person. This is another super common mistake is you're letting yourself speak like a faceless corporation because it feels like that's what you should do now. Okay, now you're a real company and now you got to do real company stuff, that means you have to issue decrees on behalf of the C corp and you don't. And it doesn't work because people don't trust institutions. People don't like corporations or at least are not passionate about them. People care about people and trust and like people, and so there's a sense of wanting to cosplay an executive and it doesn't work, it doesn't resonate. A good example of this would be Ryan Peterson at Flexport. His company, even after it got huge, he never became the generic corporate chief. He always was a person. And there are people, many, many people who became interested in Flexport because Ryan's an interesting guy. And it's not like they had a passion for logistics and freight and shipping, but he's doing something interesting. And then he became the human gateway drug for people to become interested in his company.

Lenny (00:42:40):
Yeah, absolutely. He had that crazy viral tweet about the ports and that's a really good example. Man, I was going to go in a different direction, but maybe we go to this idea of going direct. You're a big fan and Balaji is a really big fan of this too, speaking of just the importance of going direct. So maybe just talk about what does that mean and why is that important these days?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:42:58):
Well, Balaji is more go direct than me. He thinks that I'm soft in this area because I think that there's still a place for engaging with media and that it's just another tool. He's for just straight-up go direct undistilled. But I think that for everybody a 100% of the time you want going direct to be a part of what you're doing, whether it's all you're doing, or whether you're doing something else, you can't not have a direct channel. So what that actually looks like, and people say this all the time go direct. What does that actually look like to go direct? It means that the founder or executive for some very senior person has to be speaking from themselves. First person, may be first person plural, and speaking in a human voice authentically. You see them make mistakes, you see them be vulnerable, and they have to become an ambassador to the community.

(00:43:55):
If you don't have that, then you don't have a direct channel even if you have a Twitter or a Substack or whatever, it's not direct if not connected to a person because if the other side of it is a corporation there's no direct connection. And then the second thing is start building your own audience as soon as possible. You can do this alongside engaging with the media or doing traditional things. To the point of focusing your energy and decreasing the surface area, for startups I would not recommend trying to do an Instagram, a Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. I would choose the thing that that person is the best at. So if your spokesman is going to be your CEO, which is a good default, they're going to have a dominant communication style where they're the best at being themselves. And that's important because if somebody else is ghost-writing all their stuff, it shows.

(00:44:53):
So some CEOs are better at writing long form. Some CEOs are better at doing videos. Some do better with audio or podcasts, some are better with short form. The way that Elon Musk communicates on Twitter, he's born to do Twitter. You can't picture him writing long thoughtful blog posts, it's not a thing that he does. Whereas Brian Armstrong or Hamish or Chris, they write great blog posts that are sincere and effective, and that's better than them just trying to do it only through tweets. So pick the thing that your spokesperson is the best at and then invest everything into that channel, and then build it up to a decent amount and then expand outward. Because if you try to build six or seven channels at once you're just not going to get anywhere.

Lenny (00:45:47):
I think that's such a important point. I feel like me choosing a newsletter was actually a really good choice. As much as you may not believe this I'm not a performer person, I just want to hide behind the computer and just type stuff. And the newsletters, especially during COIVD, I was like, "I just sit at home and share stuff and edit and think about it where it's like, 'Hello everyone.'" And it took me a while to get to this point of like, "Oh, I can maybe do a podcast because I've built up a little more confidence that this is useful." So I so agree with that and that's what I tell a lot of people. Just pick the platform that is most natural to you. Maybe you like talking, maybe you performing on video, maybe you just want to sit and type.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:46:24):
And that's a good point too, Lenny, because it changes over time. Just because you pick one thing doesn't mean that you're stuck with only that forever. Over time you might choose different things and I've seen founders become a lot more comfortable in front of the camera, for example, once they've done a few reps. And the other reason to know that you can just change it over time is otherwise it feels like a deterrent to getting started. Sometimes there's paralysis if I don't know which thing to choose, and so I'm either going to do a bunch of them or none of them. Go with your gut pick one and you're not wed to that forever, you can always change it down the road.

Lenny (00:46:58):
Do you think every founder needs to be on Twitter? I get this a lot from founders. Do I need to be on Twitter? I hate Twitter. What's your take?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:47:04):
No, I think a lot of founders do. If they are super mission driven, for example, that's one way that you're going to find other people that resonate with your mission and that you're going to make the case for the mission. If you're mission driven there's also a good chance that you're doing something that some people love and some people hate. And so you're going to need to be out there fighting the fight in a way. I don't mean in a pugilistic antagonistic way, but you have to defend your thing. And so I think it's important if you're mission driven. I also think it's important if your charisma is a big part of recruiting for the company. There are some companies where the founder's charisma is a big part of why people want to go work there. So Palmer Lucky and Anduril, he is magnetic to a lot of engineers and they want to go work with that guy, specifically. Whereas there are companies where people want to go work for the company and it's less important that the founder is vocal.

Lenny (00:48:02):
What's interesting I found recently is I get more traffic to my newsletter from LinkedIn than Twitter. Is that something you think about at all? Going to LinkedIn instead of Twitter feels so wrong to say, but what's your take there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:14):
Yes, if you are career related, LinkedIn will be a lot better. One, it's better because it's not such a cesspool where anything immediately becomes controversial and people fight over it in their mentions. Two, because LinkedIn is really underutilized and founders should know this, PMs should know this. LinkedIn is super underutilized because it gets a ton of eyeballs in time, but most of the content sucks. 95% of the content this is not scientific-

Lenny (00:48:49):
Seems right, seems right.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:50):
This is my might estimate. 95% of the content is people congratulating each other on work anniversaries or people saying, "I'm so proud of my team for this thing they did." And then people react out of a sense of friendship and affection or support, but actually genuinely interesting and useful content on LinkedIn is very rare. So the ratio of your competitive set of interesting content versus how much time and attention people spend on there is excellent.

Lenny (00:49:24):
That is really good advice. I'm going to throw a fishing line into the pool of examples. You talked about people doing this well, going direct. Balaji talking about Ryan Peterson and Elon obviously. Is there anyone else that's just like here check out what they're doing and could be a good model to learn from?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:49:41):
I think it's really interesting to see what Mike Solana is doing with Pirate Wires. Here's an example of why it clearly makes sense to have the founder be very active on Twitter because he is his own recruiter and spokesperson. So I think the makeup industry actually is at the forefront of this. The makeup industry is smarter than all of us in how they use social media and influencers, because they caught on very early on that people don't buy makeup to subscribe to makeup brands, that they do it because a certain celebrity or influencer or Kardashian has this nice looking eyelid and they want their eyelid to look that way.

(00:50:25):
And so going back years before the rest of us were talking about going direct, there are makeup companies that would spend $0 on marketing, and minimal efforts on press and pour all of it decreasing the surface area. Pour all of it into fostering a small roster of influencers and having them spread the message. And so I think watch makeup companies, watch consumer companies, they're doing it right, they speak with a human voice, they speak through human beings and they're fast. If there's a trend the same day they will have hopped on the trend... within an hour they're on the trend, as opposed to other industries or more traditional companies that take a few days and they route through approvals and then the opportunity's gone.

Lenny (00:51:11):
What are some makeup companies for people to check out to see what they're doing?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:51:14):
So NYX, N-Y-X, it's a division of L'Oreal. NYX is wanted the makeup companies that has, as far as I know $0 spent on marketing and all of their dollars and all of their effort spent on paying influencers. And they really out punched their weight in terms of using humans to deliver a message that contains a call to action and then selling out product. And the product will be like a normal black eyeliner. It's the most fungible thing you could possibly imagine, and that one eyeliner will be sold out at CBS's across the country for a couple weeks, because they did something right with their social media using a person.

Lenny (00:51:57):
Just a couple more questions around this going direct concept. I don't know if you actually talked about why that's important because I think we talk about this a lot, and I think people may not recognize why people find this so important these days. What's the motivation behind that with Balaji and other founders?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:52:14):
There's two reasons it's important, there's the offense and the defense of it. The defense of it is going back to having the underdog, the insurgency mentality. If you're trying to do something different that goes against the grain, people are going to attack you. Not everyone's going to like it. And the point is that not everyone should like it, but you need a way to stand up for yourself because you don't have the big institutions and power structures that are going to do that work for you because you're going against the grain. So if you're going to stand up for yourself there's only one way to do it, which is you do it. And so building the audience and the channels and you have to prime the market. By which I mean if you're a public company, you're priming the market by getting them used to how you convey information to them.

(00:52:58):
If you're a small startup or a founder, you're priming the market by making your audience aware of how you normally communicate, so that when you do something it's not weird. If you never post and then suddenly you start posting, people are going to think you're having a crisis or something like what is going on? They're going to try to read into it. So you have to already have the cadence and the relationships set up so that when you need to draw on them if you're under attack then you can, that's the defense of it. The offense of it is if you're doing something new and if you're mission driven, and if what you're doing is truly unique and innovative, no one else will be to tell that as well as you. The most friendly, sympathetic reporter on Earth could not tell that as well as you because they don't understand it as well as you, and so the onus just falls on you to do it.

Lenny (00:53:52):
If someone listening is like, "Yep, okay, I fully agree, time to do this." What do you suggest as a next step to starting to build an audience and going direct broadly.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:54:03):
Step one would be assessing what are you good at and what do you enjoy? So that's where you decide, do I like long form writing, or do I enjoy podcasting, or what are my mediums? Step two is setting up your account on those channels. So if you enjoy long form writing then you're going to have to choose, do you do a Substack, do you do Medium or whatever else? There's a objectively right answer on that one. But if you are doing short videos you're going to choose are you going to invest in Instagram, or you're going to invest in TikTok, you set that up. And then you start building your audience. And when you start if you're actually starting from zero, get some pipeline of talent ready. Sorry, not pipeline or talent, pipeline of content. Get it ready, it's the same way as if you're launching a Substack.

(00:54:54):
If you're launching a Substack you want to get a week or two of posts ready to go, so that out the gate you can build a lot of momentum. With different social networks it actually helps the algorithm if you come out the gate strong and are really regular. So TikTok, for example, if you're starting at TikTok with zero followers, you want to get a week or two of solid data just in the pipeline so you can hit it, hit it because the algorithm favors you right as you're starting out because they want you to keep going, so you want to ride that as much as possible. So that's step two is just get yourself ready for launch. Don't do one post and wait, get a bunch of posts ready and then boom, boom, boom. And then three is to have an ongoing content strategy, you know who you're going to reach, you know what they care about.

(00:55:42):
So you have to plan out, "Here's the cadence with which I'm going to talk to them. Here's how I'm going to do community management and respond to people, and here are the ways where I'm going to do announcements." And you get into a cadence because it's the same as growing a newsletter. The regularity and the consistency is a big part of growing. And so it's the same with audience. A mistake that people make I think is just every once in a while trying to go viral as opposed to just being consistent. And then some posts do better than others organically, but that's the way to do it. I don't live that. I'm not a good example because I'm so self-loathing about being on Twitter I will go away for one or two weeks and do nothing, and then I'll come in with a bunch of posts in one day. It's not a best practice. It's not the way you're supposed to do it. Ideally, you're just there every day saying something and then it builds over time.

Lenny (00:56:36):
I'm actually an example of trying to focus on consistent non-viral content and it's worked out.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:56:44):
It has worked out.

Lenny (00:56:46):
It's worked out. It's worked out so far, but it's interesting to see how different people act and how it's like I'm trying to go viral every tweet, every post and that is hard. And it's also just like people can tell you're just trying to create some viral thing and no one cares.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:57:00):
And it's very obvious when you're just trying to go viral for the sake of it and you don't have a real message. It's like the post when people screenshot the iPhone six digit security code and they say best feature apple's ever built. A few people did that, and now I've seen it probably dozens of times. And it doesn't even help to get you followers because that's not something where people say, "Only this person could uniquely give me this kind of content in the future." If you're going to get followers with a one-off joke, it has to be an incredibly hilarious one-off joke where they say, "This person is going to keep entertaining me." But with these kind of viral baits, I don't think it's even that effective.

Lenny (00:57:41):
And also what I find if something does go viral, whatever the correct term is and then life goes on, nothing's going to significantly... that's just one thing, and then you have to do it again and again. That's where people don't realize like, "Oh, I went viral. I'm done. My life is good now." Nothing's going to really change most often, and you have to do it again and again.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:58:03):
I think that's true. One thing that I've noticed about your audience, Lenny, is that it's the right audience. It's the people who find value in what you do, and they're in the right place and there's a match. Sometimes in the effort to just gain followers for the sake of it or a go viral for the sake of it, you end up with a mismatch of the audience. You had this viral hamster tweet, and now they're all here expecting hamster content, and they're not engaging with you, you're not bringing value to them. It's just making the number go up, which is not that meaningful. So one example of this is there's all these threads about how to just grow on Twitter for no reason, just grow for the sake of growing.

(00:58:48):
And it's a lot of generic advice of make sure that you bullet point out the 10 things. But it's always pablum of make sure that you value your relationships, and make time for yourself. And things that are not enriching people's lives they get a lot of likes that are low value likes from random people about the internet. But I don't think that they're deepening a relationship with a meaningful audience, and I don't think that they're really capturing the respect and admiration of their peers. So I think it's just important to consider what trade-offs people make in their efforts to grow.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:35):
Ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question. Great. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:41):
I recommend Gates of Fire, it comes off the Marine Commandants Reading List, it's on there perennially. It is about the Battle of Thermopylae, it's the 300 Spartans, but it's the whole backstory. And if you get into it's about leadership, it's about courage, it's about creativity, and it's really well-written, so that's one that I recommend a lot.

Lenny (01:00:00):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:03):
I've been watching The Last Of Us, like everybody on Earth. I've been watching it both for entertainment and for work, because it's really interesting to see how the show drives sales of the video games, and how you can use that to make the whole of the sales greater than the sum of its parts. So I'm watching that really carefully.

Lenny (01:00:24):
Interesting. We have a drinking game now. Every time someone says Last of us that's a new thing because it's starting to come up a lot, so everyone enjoy your drink. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:36):
I like to ask people what they've been reading too. It's a good way to get good book recommendations. It's also a good way to see where their head's at when they're not working.

Lenny (01:00:45):
Favorite SaaS products that you use day-to-day and bonus points for something that is new or interesting that you've recently discovered?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:52):
I don't know that this is new or novel because I use Notion for almost everything, and I really like the new AI that they've built into it. I also have been using Lex, which is Nathan Baschez startup, where it's like the AI writing editor that you've probably seen. I'm trying to think if there's anything that I use that other people don't. I don't think I'm terribly original in that sense. I use a lot of Microsoft Excel, which I think is controversial.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is, wow, that's cool, but I get it. That's when you know you're doing serious work, you got to accelerate.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:27):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Final question, best tip for someone trying to get attention for their product, take away tip, best takeaway tip.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:37):
Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product.

Lenny (01:01:58):
Amazing. Lulu, I think this conversation is going to lead to a lot more people going direct, taking risks and ideas spreading. Thank you for being here. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:13):
People can find me at getflack.com, that's where I write down my ideas, hopefully more frequently in the future than in the past. But that's where they can find some of this stuff if they're interested. How can listeners be helpful to me is to give me feedback. I'm learning on the job. I don't think that there's anyone alive who's an expert in communicating in this crazy environment that we have now. I think we're all crossing the river by feeling the stones, and so your listeners have gone through this in many different ways. And I hope that if they have new ideas of feedback or objections, that they'll email me through that website or on Twitter and let me know what they think.

Lenny (01:02:54):
Amazing and its get flack.com.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Yes.

Lenny (01:02:55):
We'll link to it in the show notes.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):

# Pricing your AI product: Lessons from 400+ companies and 50 unicorns | Madhavan Ramanujam

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

(00:01:36):
Bill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.

(00:02:05):
If you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.

(00:02:19):
And some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies. If you want to work with them, check him out at 49palmsvc.com.

(00:04:34):
Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

(00:01:36):
Bill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.

(00:02:05):
If you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.

(00:02:19):
And some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies. If you want to work with them, check him out at 49palmsvc.com.

(00:04:34):
Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
Same. Bye, everyone.

# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast.

She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was also an Olympic speed skater, which is insane and incredibly cool. And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

Lenny (00:43:58):

Is there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on in the past just to give people something concrete of like here's what Maggie thinks of as a question she's going to develop a strategy around?

Maggie Crowley (00:45:28):
Yeah, I think, obviously this is where product content gets really challenging because obviously I can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Just tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00:45:38] know.

Maggie Crowley (00:45:38):
The toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well what else could you do? So, yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning. If you feel like your team needs to make a pivot or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after, is another time I might use something like this.

Lenny (00:46:30):
Awesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill Carr that I had who is an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon, one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is partly for you to realize this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback. And that's why they force you to write six pages in depth about your idea and then it goes in these concentric circles through the company. And idea is like, here's okay, and this is just not a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So, I think there's a lot of similarities there.

Maggie Crowley (00:47:00):
Yeah, there are many, many times when if you combine this artifact and process with the point about simplification where through that process you just start cutting so many things because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on. Then there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap and they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this, or we have to do that because of that.

(00:47:37):
This thing we're still working on, this is like six months delayed, so we're still going to do the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? What do you do when you have that problem? And especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say, scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.

Lenny (00:48:09):
I'm going to summarize the template real quick, and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the lines. So, if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission of the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific, if you're working on it like a product team strategy. Then there's a landscape of what's happening. So, you include competitive, SWOT analysis of competition risks, product state, business state, things like that.

(00:48:38):
And then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team slash business. And there's an account, honest accounting of what's happening in the product and technical hurdles and things like that that'll keep you from moving, I guess, achieving some of these goals. And then you share, here's the opportunity I see, how we win and how we actually achieve this opportunity where we place bets and things like that, or we could place bets. Then challenges of doing this, what needs to be true for this to be possible? And then you finally get to, here's what I think we should do, essentially the solution, ideally three bullet points, and then the plan. And I imagine the plan is step one, get sign off from exec. Step two, resource the team. Step three, start on this design research sprint.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:26):
Pretty much.

Lenny (00:49:26):
Awesome. All right. Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:49:32):
There's another-

Maggie Crowley (00:49:32):
I hope somebody does.

Lenny (00:49:34):
Okay. That'd be awesome. If they do, I will tweet it and we put it in the show notes.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:34):
Great.

Lenny (00:49:39):
So many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. So, how about we chat about that one briefly and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:52):
Okay. Yeah, I don't think I have much to say about this. That has not been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, a one pager, I don't even know what else people call it. It's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team, and that means product design, engineering, your little squad. And what I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. So, designers produce designs, engineers write code. What do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document and it can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and when it's really effective is it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. And if you structure it correctly, the most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context?

(00:51:00):
What is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now? And if you get those things right, the rest gets really easy, but it gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or it's something the user is experiencing and why that problem is worth solving. That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about and why it's we're solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving and then it can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. So, I think it's best when you have those sections and then also best when you write down on this day, we made this decision or we decided not to do this or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and a link off to all the different artifacts and research and things is helpful for a team.

Lenny (00:51:52):
So, just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes and wants to create the rule template?

Maggie Crowley (00:51:57):
I don't think these templates have to be really complicated. It's like background and context. The problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated, just answer those questions and if you can do that, and then again, it's only really helpful if then you bring that document before you go any further to your team and you use it to have a conversation and you get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically speaking my engineering counterpart and I say, shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down how it gets better. And as a PM you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it.

Lenny (00:52:48):
The why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00:53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, "How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?" He's just like, "There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business." And I feel like this is a good example of that in action.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:39):
Yeah, I love his take on quality and taste too.

Lenny (00:53:43):
Yeah. What a gem.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:44):
Yeah, big fan of that. But yeah, I mean it's really hard to stay disciplined, it's hard to stay focused and to your point, there's a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work at a bigger company. And so the why now is an important question to answer because if not, somebody's going to ask you. So, you may as well think about it.

Lenny (00:54:02):
Yeah, it's interesting why now comes up a lot in investing in startups but rarely in product building and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, why now ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So, I think there's a two sides to that coin. Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic and this might become a new thing that we do and I'm going to call it contrarian corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode and you had some really good ones. So, there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking as I say this?

Maggie Crowley (00:54:39):
I'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic and we would click the end recording button and then every single guest would be like, I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up, it was waterfall. None of that matters. I didn't know what I was ... People would say the wildest stuff and I would sit there as a PM and just think what. We just talked about this framework, we just talked about this thing and that's how you're supposed to do it. And then they would get off the official part and just say, yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go. And so I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show.

Lenny (00:55:18):
I'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are the ideal version of what they do and I rarely or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having, which I think there's truth to that, but I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just here's things that go wrong versus the newsletter. So, I'm just like shit, I need to do more of that. So, I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess maybe before we get there, is there an example of something that didn't go just along the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?

Maggie Crowley (00:55:59):
I might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty, you just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important. And I remember, it was so dumb, I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of a existing product and engineer who I'd worked with many times. We had a really good relationship and this person was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months, no problem.

(00:56:47):
Core part of the product been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still, it's still the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months, it took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never, it went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So, many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb, sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager, we just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.

Lenny (00:57:34):
And did not work out or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?

Maggie Crowley (00:57:39):
Absolutely not. But you know what, I didn't get fired, so it's fine.

Lenny (00:57:43):
I feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later it's like another, maybe this rewrite and redesign may work because we haven't updated this thing in a long time.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:52):
Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side by side re-write, nope.

Lenny (00:57:59):
Yeah, what I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite everyone's building in that new world and then you launch an experiment's negative and then it's just like, oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get figure out how to get back to neutral someday.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:59):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:15):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:58:15):
Yeah. Don't do that.

Lenny (00:58:16):
Good times. Okay, well maybe we'll start a failure corner. That could be a new segment. We may have a little sound and theme music, but this time we have contrarian corner and you have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple topics. The first is product management. What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?

Maggie Crowley (00:58:39):
The one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking, especially if it's an executive who's saying things like, oh, so we make all our decisions with our dashboards. To me that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. And maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. And oftentimes maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you. But most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard.

Lenny (00:59:51):
So, the takeaway there is just be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven. Our team is super data-driven or company company's super data-driven.

Maggie Crowley (01:00:00):
Yeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01:00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.

(01:00:38):
He was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment and do that thing and let's move on. And I've always thought about that, but you can just do the obviously better thing.

Lenny (01:00:58):
Yeah, I love that I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way of just like, okay, everyone, this one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Enough research. Okay, another topic that you have some interesting opinions about his product content very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.

Maggie Crowley (01:01:20):
Really if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. And then slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, well look how well I did this framework. Look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point which is creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then makes people think that, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want. And now I'll just check off my list and then I checked it off and then I should get my promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out and they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment, but I know what to do because I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to users or whatever.

(01:02:16):
And so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it and you think that the point is the framework and the point is the one pager or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not. And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps, so why are you asking me for a roadmap? And then you're the who's sitting there being like, well, it's a little more complicated than that. And that was a fun take that I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because planning and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.

Lenny (01:02:52):
That's so funny that I didn't think about you as a leader having put stuff out that people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume content online about how to do product management, you have to really distill it. And to your point, it often loses the nuance. Because if you had all the ones, no one's going to even read it so complicated and long. And then the other point of there's also just it has to be interesting. So, if it's another just like, here's how a roadmap really is successfully and it's like what everyone's already done, no one's going to read it. So, you always have to have a new take. And with that comes, it's not actually always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea.

Maggie Crowley (01:03:32):
Yeah, I mean it's helpful. I think there's some people who create, I mean there's many things at my last role, we all had your newsletter and we listened to the show and then people would bring, I should have found a clip, but I can't remember, there were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, oh, this could help. Or what if we did it that way? I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like product review template for FigJam. Love that one. Use that one all the time.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Amazing.

Maggie Crowley (01:04:06):
So, yeah, I mean the stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules.

Lenny (01:04:18):
If they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post letting you write, we should be doing it this way. Versus I think people assume these are the one way to do it or innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add to every newsletters. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well, there's always a little bit missing

Maggie Crowley (01:04:55):
And I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company? But again, if you view it as more like here all the tools that you can add to your toolkit and you pull them out when you're in a situation from which they can be useful, that's how I think about it. Versus this is the one way to do it like you said, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can write an experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.

Lenny (01:05:19):
And I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it. Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it, as much as I can get into and leave it to the reader to decide is this going to be a fit for me, should I try to implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do research, here's the way to do roadmap, here's the way to prioritize. But I think it's interesting that you also, yourself create a lot of content and you actually found a lot of value from being, let's not call you content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself.

Maggie Crowley (01:05:55):
Someone one's called me a product influencer and I'll died like a little bit.

Lenny (01:05:59):
That's how I feel. I'd love to hear just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.

Maggie Crowley (01:06:11):
Yeah, it's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I am so grateful for the people whose idea it was, who supported me and especially at Drift, when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if a friend of a friend had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections. And so access to people and networking is one of the first benefits.

(01:06:51):
Also building a personal brand is really helpful if you want, one of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that I'm always employable. I just didn't want to, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there, and it was a hard time. And so I've always had this in the back of my mind, you want to be able to have a solid career. And so I thought that investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people. Because a lot of my job now is bringing people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, a lot of people and they will send me a note and say, I want to work with you, or I want to work on a team like that.

(01:07:35):
And that's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would've been able to. Because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did, you have to summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people. And then especially if it's in a podcast meeting, talk to somebody about it. And the process of doing that means that you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. And so often we don't do that because we're busy working, we have our lives, things are happening. And that to me is, I think what's made me a better product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down.

Lenny (01:08:28):
Something that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoided being cringy and very thirsty for followers. And I think when a lot of people here build a personal brand, it's like, I don't want to.

Maggie Crowley (01:08:44):
I know. It makes me ill even saying that, it's like too gross.

Lenny (01:08:47):
I never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01:09:02].

Maggie Crowley (01:09:02):
Yeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?

Lenny (01:09:02):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:22):
It's natural.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Although randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01:09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:30):
So, it went really hot with your first guest.

Lenny (01:09:34):
That's right. That's right.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:35):
So, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I did was those were my real questions that I was really working on.

(01:09:59):
So, we joked about how we would turn off the recording and then we would get the real story, but I would turn the recording off and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's actually happening in my job today, what would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was working on and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable is because I was actively a PM and the way that I'm still actively in product, that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and share.

Lenny (01:10:34):
I think there's some two really important points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff's going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the things, you're just pretending. It's like you're acting like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you haven't done the thing, because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well I did it for two months and I have nothing more to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:11:03):
Right.

Lenny (01:11:05):
And then the other piece is there's a guest who shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like, "Seek not to be successful but of value." And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff is just share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from this is useful, not from, I'm trying to build a following. Because people can tell if that's the-

Maggie Crowley (01:11:30):
Yeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of too cool for school mixed in here and there are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever because that's what they want to do. And I'm not even going to get into psychology of that, but people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting people out there, people who are unashamedly interested in stuff and who are like, yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And for better for worse, I love working in product. I love the job.

(01:12:08):
Even all the gross stuff you have to do, it's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really cool job and I've always been interested in how to do it better and it doesn't matter to me that some people might think that's cringe because that's cool, but this is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it.

Lenny (01:12:26):
I think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that. Just it needs to feel really authentic and clearly for you is just like, there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.

Maggie Crowley (01:12:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:37):
The way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is I wanted to learn the thing and so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I just thought it was interesting and I found it useful and I just assumed other people might find it useful. So, I did also learn, and I wonder if you found this too, is that you think the things are not going to be that interesting or useful to people, so basic for you, but people find the most basic stuff so interesting. Because there's always more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize, how to hire, how to talk, to have difficult conversations, performance review.

Maggie Crowley (01:13:15):
All of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I was really happy with was I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint presenter slides or whatever, and I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay, here's how I do that. I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things, then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually make the slide.

(01:13:51):
And it was like some silly little thing and this person sat there and said, holy, you just totally changed the way I did this and this took me 75% less time than it would've taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be a stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're really good at that you don't realize.

Lenny (01:14:13):
I think people need to really internalize that point. If there's something that you're doing that you consistently find useful and works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. So, that could be a good place to start. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome.

Maggie Crowley (01:14:32):
Great.

Lenny (01:14:32):
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or touch on think might be useful to leave folks with?

Maggie Crowley (01:14:41):
My hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think you can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. People are weird, people do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which it makes it all very entertaining. So, I've always found a lot of joy in the job.

Lenny (01:15:04):
And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for PM.

Maggie Crowley (01:15:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (01:15:17):
Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:21):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:15:22):
Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:27):
First, most common one is probably the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, the little tiny one, really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So, that's one. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one. Coming back to the point about being able to make bets, I think that one's a really interesting one. And then bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk, the Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk and I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.

Lenny (01:16:11):
I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there and it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one. Highly recommend. She's incredible. Great choice. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Maggie Crowley (01:16:27):
Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say here in LA, and so we watch a lot of good and bad shows in TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses. Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.

Lenny (01:16:43):
Wow, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip. What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.

Maggie Crowley (01:16:51):
I did. Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this and then I do this in an interview, people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. And it tells me you have some humor, you're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake. You've done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I've made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them. And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.

Lenny (01:17:29):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Maggie Crowley (01:17:33):
One because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.

Lenny (01:17:36):
Yeah, I'm.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:37):
Is that correct?

Lenny (01:17:37):
I use it three times a week. I love it.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:39):
Yes. I was also a future fit person. I think it's great. It's a great product. I'm now on Ladder Fit.

Lenny (01:17:46):
I've heard of that.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:47):
And personally, I love not being, I don't have to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability, so that's not a thing that I needed as an ex athlete. So, for me, that didn't serve me and I like the anonymity of it and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.

Lenny (01:18:07):
Sweet.

Maggie Crowley (01:18:08):
So, that's one more of a funny one. And the second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well and they're not, to your point about side quest, there's no side quests. I'm a new mom. There's this app called Pump Log. I have never seen an execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. It's like I paid $14 for it. I've never paid for an app like that in my life.

Lenny (01:18:40):
Okay, I'm downloading it right after we finish. Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself, often like to share with folks, find useful, and just kind of living life?

Maggie Crowley (01:18:51):
I'm sure there's mottos' I could say that would be aspirational mottos', but the real one is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. And again, from being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability because that's what you do with your day. You spend so much time working, you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. And that's always how I've lived my life.

Lenny (01:19:20):
I so love that message. I always think about that. Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily. That's insane. My question is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people that would be like, what?

Maggie Crowley (01:19:38):
Ooh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience, I've obviously learned a ton from it, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks. And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in a dark corner and then you get a chance to get the light to shine on you and you learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater, it's a 400-meter rink.

(01:20:15):
You just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts and you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again, and you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus, and I think it's also cool you get to go superfast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating, but I think just about being a small sport elite athlete, it's really about years and years and years of toiling and silence to get maybe one shot at something great.

Lenny (01:20:46):
So, much of what you just said would apply 100% to product management and I love that. Maggie, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Maggie Crowley (01:21:00):
You can find me on Twitter for sure. By LinkedIn, but just speaking of cringe, I just can't get into LinkedIn posting.

Lenny (01:21:09):
LinkedIn's gotten better, I'd give it a shot. It's actually pretty interesting now, which sound weird to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:16):
Thinking about it, I better go back to work in a couple of weeks and thinking about LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure, and I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me, my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had. So, hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.

Lenny (01:21:39):
Maybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:42):
Oh yes, Plug, Toast. Come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler. It's phenomenal.

Lenny (01:21:50):
Legendary, previous guest. Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just like, hey, maybe I should go do that.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:56):
There are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place.

Lenny (01:22:01):
Willing to the careers page.

Maggie Crowley (01:22:03):

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:03):
Manik Gupta has led two of the most successful consumer products in history: Google Maps, where he was director of product for the Maps team, and Uber where he was Chief Product Officer. After leaving Uber, he spent most of his time working on a product to help people avoid getting COVID, called CVKey, and most recently he took on a role at Microsoft as Corporate Vice President leading many of their consumer efforts.

(00:00:25):
In our conversation, we cover what he's learned about building successful consumer products, how to structure and higher product teams, building consumer apps, a concept called the consumer stack, company market fit versus product market fit, what it's like to be CPO, what he learned working at Microsoft versus Uber versus Google, and also a ton of career advice for anyone thinking about becoming a CPO someday. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Manik Gupta.

Hey, Casey Winters. What do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (00:02:00):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart, because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, you know I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. They're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (00:02:36):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:03):
Manik, welcome to the podcast.

Manik Gupta (00:03:06):
Thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here, man.

Lenny (00:03:08):
I don't know if it's obvious, but I am quite honored to have you on this podcast. You've had such an illustrious career as a founder leading the Google Maps team, as CPO at Uber for, I believe, four years. Now you're kind of a fancy VP at Microsoft on consumer stuff. It's this incredible career and trajectory. My first question is, looking back at your career, what would you say is maybe the one or two main things that you did that helped you get to where you are today? For folks that are maybe earlier in the career, of what they should be focusing on.

Manik Gupta (00:03:39):
Yeah. Thanks, Lenny, for having me. I'm also a big fan of yours, by the way. I love your newsletter and it's been incredible to just see how you have also grown both the set of topics that you cover and this podcast. Just really a big fan, so again, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:54):
Appreciate that.

Manik Gupta (00:03:55):
Let me start by telling you a little bit about my philosophy of this. I'm maybe a little bit late to the party, but I recently read this book from Morgan Hausel on Psychology of Money. And I highly recommend your listeners read it if they get a chance. There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part.

(00:04:45):
This is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, which is what are some of the patterns of people who have had multiple careers and have gone through a journey where they've learned a lot and they've contributed and things like that? I think there are two patterns that stand out, both when I look at myself in terms of what I've been through, and also when I talk to a lot of my friends who have also gone on and done interesting things, and I wanted to cover both of that. The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find.

(00:05:16):
It was so funny. I was watching the Warriors game last night, and yeah Warriors, we won the NBA championship. That's great.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Go Warriors.

Manik Gupta (00:05:24):
One of the reporters, I think she asked Steve Kerr, the coach, "What's the secret?" And he goes, "Well just hang around superstars." That's what he said and he just passed the mic over to somebody else and said, "Look, this is a team that's hanging around superstars." And that's exactly what it is. If you're create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career as you asked, around hanging around people who are doing interesting things and they're doing things which really are different, or they're doing things in a different manner and it's exciting, the right things will happen.

(00:05:55):
I was lucky in a way that I caught myself in that situation. I grew up in India and when I was 16 I got a scholarship to move to Singapore to do my high school and then my undergrad studies. It just turned out that during those days, Singapore... I mean it still is, but it was a melting pot for the best and brightest folks that you can get from all over the Asia diaspora if you will. Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore. We were just part of that ecosystem and it gave me a lot of opportunities to try out different things in college and so on and so forth.

(00:06:44):
I think the main thing that I would say here for people who are early in career is just surround yourself with people who are really good at what they do. Learn from them. And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way. Anyway, that's pattern number one. I think that has helped me a lot and I also see a lot of that in other folks whom I talk to.

(00:07:19):
Then the second pattern is... This is something I resonate a lot with personally, is I'm a strong technology optimist. There's always a lot of narrative these days around technology and maybe a little bit more pessimism, and I find that bizarre. I'm just such a strong technology advocate and optimist, because I feel technology's such a strong force for good. I grew up as an engineer myself, and I've always been attracted to projects where we can use technology to solve a real human need. I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well. The passion that you get if you're a strong advocate of technology and how it can really help, it just gets you to choose a set of things that you want to do at scale.

(00:08:06):
For instance, when I joined Google in India to work on Maps, it was all about helping millions of users, around Asia particularly, navigate their world. There wasn't a good solution like that, so how can you bring technology to really solve those problems?

(00:08:21):
I think those are the two patterns, Lenny. One is surrounding yourself with A plus people, and the second is just having very strong optimism and passion about technology. At least if I connect their dots looking backwards, those are the things that have really helped me and a bunch of other folks that I see in a similar situation. I'm hoping that folks early in their career thing through that.

Lenny (00:08:40):
I bet there's a big overlap between those two points, technology optimist and just superstars. That's interesting.

Manik Gupta (00:08:46):
Yeah, there definitely is. That's actually really good. I hadn't thought about that. You're right. I think there's definitely that overlap, because folks who are in that mode, they really get around more together. I'm also an angel investor and an investor in a bunch of companies. Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that. It's really about people who have the same kind of frequency in terms of thinking about the world outlook and they want to go on to do interesting things. I think that's really what drives the narrative forward.

Lenny (00:09:14):
Speaking of technology optimism and technology in general, of the things that you've worked on, what would you say you're most proud of project wise, product wise, feature wise?

Manik Gupta (00:09:23):
Yeah. Again, I've had just the incredible opportunity to be part of phenomenal companies that have created world changing products. I had a small, small, small part to play in that. I always emphasize that. It's not me, it was a team. And I really mean it. I'm not just saying it because I'm on your podcast, but it truly is. I'm particularly proud of the work that I did both at Google and at Uber. I'll give you a couple of examples to illustrate that point.

(00:09:47):
When I joined Google in India in 2008, I started off working on Google Maps and I remember how counterintuitive it was for anybody; my friends and family, a bunch of other folks whom I talked to. Counterintuitive in terms of why would anybody ever use maps on their mobile phone in India? The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, "Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?" That was the norm. That's how people navigated for a really long time.

(00:10:32):
When I started working on it, I think for me, my belief was, again going back to the tech optimism aspect, is why can't we in India have the same quality maps like we have in the United States? Why not? Why shouldn't we do it? Why are users here not getting the same benefit and same productivity gain, if you will, and less stress in their daily commute and things like that?

(00:10:55):
So we started building it. We started building the data. We went ahead and really mapped the country as much as we could. Both ourselves and through a lot of amazing work from our users who co-mapped the world with us. Over time, India became, I think, the second largest country for Google Maps in the world in terms of users. Of course, a lot of that happened because of Android. Android took off and Android had Google Maps on it. But it's just incredible to see how, in a short span of a few years, it just went up to becoming so useful. It's not that we were just distributing Google Maps on Android, people were using it. People were actually using it to go from point A to point B.

(00:11:35):
I feel really proud about that. I think the team did an incredible effort. It wasn't even a big team. It was a relatively small team, very passionate about going and doing this, and we made that happen.

(00:11:43):
Then at Uber, initially, before I took on the CPO role, I was leading maps and marketplace. When I was doing maps and marketplace, again, how do you get the ETA that you see on Uber when you open the Uber app and you request a car... The average ETA's went down to less than five minutes globally. Just think about that for a minute. In fact, it was 75 countries, more than 300 cities, if I remember correctly, where you could just open the Uber app and get an Uber in, average, less than five minutes. A lot of operational work need to happen for sure, but the technology, the marketplace technology especially to be able to connect the right rider to the right driver, have the mapping infrastructure underneath it to ensure that the car actually reaches you in that amount of time; I just feel very proud of all the work that happened during that time to make Uber really successful in terms of providing that kind of a service.

(00:12:37):
One fun anecdote I'll give you where my world came together and it just blows my mind even today, I remember I joined Uber in late 2015 and I made a trip to India to see my parents in sometime around 2016, 2017. I forget. It was around that time. And I was at home in Bangalore and I ordered an Uber. And the guy shows up, the driver comes in, and I sit in the back of the car. He starts the trip using the Uber app, and then he clicks Navigate and he goes to Google Maps. And I was sitting there. I was like, "Man, I built these two to a certain extent." It was just crazy to think about how two of my worlds came together at that point. I still vividly remember that moment where I felt really proud that I had a little bit of a part to play in both those products.

Lenny (00:13:26):
That is some unbelievable impact. It boggles my mind how many people have been impacted by the work that you've done on the teams that you've been on. Like a billion people in India and everyone in the world using Uber. It's unreal. I would feel very proud myself, watching that experience.

(00:13:41):
Something people may feel when they see a career like yours, they're like, "Man, Manik's just killing it. He's done everything. Everything just is clicking, always winning." I imagine there's been a few times when you've made mistakes or things have been really challenging. What would you say has been one of the more challenging projects or points in your career?

Manik Gupta (00:13:59):
Yeah. No, absolutely. This is really important to talk about as well, because we glamorize successes and we don't talk enough about challenges. I'm really happy that you're asking this. I would give you two times which... I had a lot of learning from both of them, but they were pretty tough times for me. The first time was, I had started my own company at the height of the dotcom boom. We incorporated our company in June '99, and then in March of 2000 we sold our company to another company from Norway. That was the peak of the dotcom boom. Then within a few months right after that, we had the dotcom bust and it was terrible. Terrible. I know we have a pretty bad economy right now. There's a lot of stuff going on. It was really bad, because people around me, my friends, were losing their jobs.

(00:14:52):
Luckily we had some funding. We had secured some of our funding and we had had an acquisition. The parent company was pretty strong in terms of their balance sheet, so we could continue to do it. But things didn't get better, Lenny. 2000 went by, 2001 came in. We kept waiting for things to improve, but they never improved. So we had to pivot. We had to pivot as a company. My co-founders actually left the company at that point. I still wanted to be there, because I really believed that I can keep moving this company forward. Then I was working with the founders of the parent company. We pivoted multiple times, we tried a few things. I even relocated back from Singapore back to India to set up an engineering office so that we can get into a SaaS kind of a model versus an eCommerce company that we were.

(00:15:35):
I tried many things over those two or three years. And remember, this was my first, quote unquote, "job" out of college. I was doing a lot of that and it was a very tough time. But at the same time I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself, I learned a lot about managing ambiguity and just keeping people motivated through a tough time. A lot of that also has to come from keeping yourself motivated, because people can smell fear and pessimism from far. Just like optimism is infectious, so is pessimism. If you're not feeling great as a leader, people will see it. Absolutely. People are not stupid. You have to not fake it. You have to really be motivated to stick it out, and that's what I tried to do at least, and I learned a lot in that. That was one really challenging time for me.

(00:16:21):
Then the second one was, man, during Uber. 2017, 2018 was crazy at Uber. Oh my God. There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well. It was something where you just had to keep your head down and just keep staying focused on what the core is.

(00:17:03):
I think that is where, Lenny, the optimism in me in terms of, what am I really doing? Is this a service that really benefits millions of people around the world? Are we creating true change? Those are things that I just have to dig deep into to make sure that I stay grounded on why am I here and why I remain to be here and then at the same time motivate my team. But yeah, those were the two really challenging times that I have encountered, at least in my career.

Lenny (00:17:26):
Those are awesome examples. I imagine a lot of founders are going through a lot of challenging times right now with the market, and imagine these experiences for you were really important and impacted your ability to take on bigger roles and bigger challenges in the future. Is that how you see it? These are important experiences to have over time as a product leader and just leader in general?

Manik Gupta (00:17:46):
Oh, absolutely. Because like I said, you learn a lot about yourself when you go through a situation like this. You learn both things that bother you or bring you down, and things that give you energy. It's sometimes counterintuitive to think about this. When you're going through a bad time, often then people will say, "Well, during a bad time I only learned things which are bad." But you also learn things that are good. Which is, maybe during a bad time you did something and you suddenly felt relieved or energized, and then you look at that and say, "Wait, I should do more of that even during a good time, because can you imagine the compounding power that I would get? Because stuff is good and I'm doing this and I'll feel even better."

(00:18:26):
I learned a lot in terms of my own personal energy, things that get me going, things that really stop me in my tracks. And at the same time, how do you work with a team? How do you motivate them? How do you keep your head down and focus, versus getting distracted? What are some of the decisions you make around your product roadmap?

(00:18:47):
I'll give you an example. During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, "Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers." We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter. The point was that you get confidence from getting things out, putting it out there, and you feel good about being a builder and being someone who is actually creating a difference. That really grounds the team and focuses the team that there is some real value here.

(00:19:45):
Some of those things I picked up. Both going through that turbulent time, I picked up. And I have used that even in good times to make sure that we keep building good products.

Lenny (00:19:56):
That's such a good tactical tip. Find a win. Keep people motivated. Speaking of wins, coming back to Google Maps and Uber, they're probably two of the most widely used, successful consumer products in the world. I don't know if I can think of other products that are used by more people for this long. Then now at Microsoft you're helping Microsoft get more into consumer on the communications side. I imagine you know a thing or two about building successful consumer apps, and so I want to ask a couple questions along those lines. What are two or three surprising or counterintuitive things that you've learned about building consumer products?

Manik Gupta (00:20:32):
The good news is that there's just... Because of Twitter and a bunch of other channels, including your newsletter by the way, I feel like people are very well informed these days. And I love that.

(00:20:43):
Let me digress for a second and then I'll come back to your question. One thing that I'm observing a lot, Lenny, which I feel very, very happy about, is the quality of learning and insights and frameworks and best practices is so universal at this point. It used to be that you had to be in the Valley or being part of a small group of folks who are doing things at the cutting edge to have those crazy insights about how do you find product market fit and do all that kind of stuff. Today I talk to people from all over the world for various reasons, and it's incredible how fast people pick up all these insights and frameworks and then they apply them to their local setting and so on. I find that to be one of the most wonderful things ever.

(00:21:32):
I think folks like you have obviously played a big part, because you have global subscribers and you share some of the best practices. But just generally, that's actually a really good thing for the world, that people have so much access to clarity of thinking. And the best people are actually putting themselves out there, which is great.

(00:21:47):
In terms of the counterintuitive stuff, I think two things. One is building consumer products is very hard. I think people think it's easy, because each of us is a consumer. We think of ourselves as a good user, we think of our friends as users, we think of our family as users. And we say, "Well, if we just build it for ourselves and for our family and friends..." By the way, a lot of great consumer products started that way, so I'm not saying don't do that. But man, it's hard. It takes a long time to get things right. Because you're essentially trying to get so many things right when you're building a successful consumer product. You have to be able to reach out to a vast, heterogeneous set of users who have different needs, who have different perspectives. The go to market is always very interesting, because you can't force people to use your product. People have to choose you, you don't choose them. That's the part where... How do you drive virality? How do you drive that real love for a consumer product? And it has to create real value.

(00:22:52):
The other thing about time is that, in order for you to find product market fit and then scale from there, you just have to try a lot of different things. There are theoretical playbooks around it, but you got to just get into it. Going back to the point I was making earlier about wins, get some wins and see the results and then iterate from there. I think it's just hard and it takes a lot longer than what people imagine consumer products do. Versus, let's say, enterprise products or products of other nature. That's one counterintuitive thing that at least I've learned.

(00:23:21):
The second one is the global patterns that you see in consumer products in terms of the user interface; the core things that people do or expect. At this point along of that is pretty universal. There's always this debate where people would say, "Well, need to have one product for the U.S., another different type of product for Asia, another different type of product for Africa. I think we are past that point. That's again another counterintuitive thing, where people spend a little too much... I've seen this in many companies. People spend too much time debating that, "Oh, the users in market X are different." Well yes, they're different, but they use the product the same way.

(00:24:02):
That's the part which I think... And I'm not making an argument against localization. Of course you need localization around language, pricing. There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.

(00:24:33):
That's the other counterintuitive thing that people should know about consumer products. Build for the world from day one. Understand that there are going to be some nuances that you'll have to solve as you drive adoption in certain markets, but don't over index on building market specific solutions, because consumers have moved on from that kind of a model. Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years.

Lenny (00:25:02):

(00:26:04):
Before this chat, we were chatting about this idea of company product fit for bigger companies. How it's an approach to building new products within big companies. Can you just talk about that idea?

Manik Gupta (00:26:17):
Yeah, absolutely. I've been noodling a lot on this, especially since I took on my role at Microsoft as well. And prior to that, even at Google, this was always an interesting discussion. Let's say you are building a new product or leading a new project, if you will, at a larger company. In fact, this also applies to medium-sized companies. I wouldn't say for startups, but medium-sized companies. Usually the narrative in the room when you're discussing this with your team and with your leadership team would be, "Okay, we got to go find product market fit." Absolutely. Yeah. We have to do a bunch of stuff, as we just talked about. Consumer products take time. All of that stuff.

(00:26:57):
But I think there's a question before that question, which is how do you find company product fit? What I define as company product fit. Which is a company essentially is a portfolio of products, and every large company, medium-sized company also has a portfolio. They'll have 10, 20, in some cases hundreds of products in the portfolio. Every company has unique strengths and weaknesses. This is pretty tried, but it's obvious. And I would encourage a lot of folks, when they start embarking on this journey where they're trying to really build out products and so on, is to ask that question. How does that product, assuming it's successful... If it is not successful, it doesn't matter anyway. But assuming it's successful, does it actually serve the right place in a company's product portfolio? Or not? And if it doesn't, don't do it. Why waste time?

(00:27:57):
Oftentimes companies will be like, "I want to do this because some other company is doing it." That is not a good reason. You should only invest in products, or projects for that matter, because you can play to your strengths and you can create some unique consumer, customer value. And by the way, you can do it better than anybody else out there. That's what I mean by company product fit. Take that first step and understand does this even resonate and is it part of the portfolio? Does it make sense?

(00:28:26):
Because if you can answer that question with enough conviction, then your road to the next step on finding product market fit becomes much easier, because you don't have distractions then. Everybody gets it. Everybody gets this is a strategic effort. You have the right sponsorship at the right levels in the company, and you're executing towards it and you're finding it out. Let's say things don't go well. That's okay. People will step in to help. A lot of that will happen, because people innately get it. That this is the right product to go after from a company product fit perspective. That's something that I've been thinking a lot about and also executing as we move forward.

Lenny (00:29:00):
Is there an example of that gone wrong that you can share? Whether it's a company you've worked at or a company you've seen do it badly.

Manik Gupta (00:29:05):
I'll have to think through specific examples, but companies do this all the time, where they do these line extensions. Where they'll say, "Well, we have a lot of traction in a particular segment. Why don't we just go to an adjacent segment? If we just add two more features, suddenly this will be appealing to an adjacent segment." A classic example would be you're doing something for, I don't know, small and medium businesses and you say, "Well, now I just have to add two more features and now I'm going to go up market and I'll get to compete in the enterprise." Or it could be the other way around too, where you have something in the enterprise business and you want to suddenly go down market to SMB.

(00:29:44):
In my view, it's hard. Because again, the capabilities that you need, the thinking that you need, is something you have to really be clear about. This is not to say that it will not fit in the company's portfolio. It's just that when you're making a choice like that, make sure you set it up well to succeed. That's the other part of the equation as well.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Speaking of setting it up to succeed, you also have this idea of a consumer stack concept that I think you've been talking about at Microsoft. Can you talk about what that's all about?

Manik Gupta (00:30:11):
Yeah, sure. One of the things that I'm doing at Microsoft right now is, while I'm working on a lot of the consumer communication products, the other thing that I'm really helping the company think about is how do we get more at scale consumer products built at Microsoft. Part of this is just distilling some of the learnings that I've had over the years. I think there are like five things that I would talk about, which I call the consumer stack, which is essentially a set of capabilities that companies need to have a good chance of success at building a consumer product. Remember, nobody can give a playbook to build a successful consumer product. That does not exist. Because as we were discussing earlier, it's so fickle and so many things have to go right for you to build a successful consumer product. But at least you have a set of capabilities, so you set yourself up the best.

(00:31:01):
The first one I would say is around design-led thinking to delight users. Going back to your days at Airbnb, Lenny, I'm sure this is something that resonates with you. Design for consumer products is such a critical part of how you build the right pull from consumers these days. Poorly designed products have no chance at this point. Your craftsmanship and the design capabilities have to be A plus. And if you don't have that, then you should really invest in that. This is not just about having the best designers. Of course you should. It's just the thinking. It's a attention to detail. It's the attention to how things are pixel to pixel, moving from one screen to another screen and so on. You really have to sweat it out and really be clear in terms of how it's adding value to a consumer. That is, I think, a core capability in these days to build a consumer product. That's number one.

(00:31:54):
Number two is strong focus and prioritization. You can apply strong focus and prioritization to anything in life, but I think it's even more important for consumer products. Because oftentimes people, when they think about solving a problem, they think about coming up with 20 features at the same time, and it's not needed. You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... Firstly your product should have very few features in the beginning. But even if it has those features, it should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused. That's the second one.

(00:32:38):
Most PMs totally understand that. That's their job description, to focus and prioritize. But I feel like a lot of times the PMs do get very confused and distracted, because the number of ideas that people have is so large that they want to just throw everything into the product, and that doesn't work. You have to keep a very high bar for focus and prioritization. That's capability number two.

(00:33:00):
Number three is having the right metrics and instrumentation. This talks to the data aspect of the culture, which is, if you don't have the metric with regards to what you're optimizing for at the initial state of the product, middle state of the product, late stage of the product, you're just not going to choose the right things. How will you measure success? How will you convince yourself, your team, and broader stakeholders that this is actually working or not working? Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, "Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?" And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion. That's number three.

(00:33:59):
Number four is more on the engineering side, which is how do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product.

(00:34:29):
Finally, underpinning all of this is just having strong talent. Assess your talent; your product talent, your design talent, your data talent, your engineering talent, your marketing talent, all these functions. You just have to have a talented pool of people who like to build stuff, and they're the people who understand and have the empathy for consumers.

(00:34:50):
To me, I think these five capabilities... And as a leader, or product leader, or an engineering leader, or anyone who's basically responsible for running products in small company, big company, medium-sized company, it doesn't matter; if you're in the consumer space, my thinking here is that if you look at these five categories and five capabilities, you should really have a report card and say, "Okay. How do I rate these?" If I were to look at my own team, what do I think about design thinking? What do I think about strong focus and prioritization? Are we doing an A job? Are we doing a B job? Are doing a C job or D job? I would argue that if you get to an A job over time, because not everybody will be at A on day one, but if you get that over time, I think you will start seeing results which are very meaningful. That's how I've been thinking about the consumer stack.

Lenny (00:35:34):
Awesome. I was going to ask how you operationalize this. It sounds like it's going to turn into Manik's consumer stack scorecard, and bigger companies can leverage this at their own company and show their manager, "Hey, we're moving really slowly. Maybe this is an area we should focus before we bet big on consumer."

Manik Gupta (00:35:50):
Yeah. I'm trying to operationalize this myself right now in my current job, and I have used some version of this. I mean, this is not something I just came up with. It's something that has been in my mind for a while. I've used it in some shape or form. But during my break, especially before I joined Microsoft, I think this came together for me as something a little bit more tangible that I can use. Then I started applying it, so I think it's been pretty interesting to see.

Lenny (00:36:15):
Awesome. I'm hoping that this proliferates through larger companies and becomes a thing that we can root back to this chat.

(00:36:23):
Shifting a little bit to the CPO role and the VP of product role that you've had at a few companies, in theory this is kind of an end state for a product leader. Every PM, if they stay down the PM career track, they'll become a CPO or VP of product or head of product somewhere. A couple of questions here. One is, do you have a sense of how many PMs actually stay on this track and end up in one of these roles, versus move on to some other role or place?

Manik Gupta (00:36:47):
Yeah. That's a great question. I would say that the percentage for CPO in particular, you having a C title and being a CPO, I think that percentage is still relatively small. This is just my sense. I haven't done the numbers to give you a more accurate picture here, but I think my sense is relatively smaller. Because I think a large part of it depends on how companies are organized. Companies can be organized functionally, companies can be organized through business units, and oftentimes these days it's a mix of both. If you look at any company, they'll have some C level functional executives, but underneath them they'll have GMs. The organization design is just such an evolving field always. And as they say, companies will go one... they'll swing the pendulum one way and they'll say, "Oh, over time it's not working," and then they'll swing the pendulum the other way and then they keep going back and forth. I think the percentage for CPO in particularly in my mind is probably not as big as what people think it is. Like I said, because of the way that companies are organized.

(00:37:50):
I think the interesting thing here is I am just seeing personally, having been a CPO myself and also talking to a lot of people in my network and just observing a bunch of different companies, I think the CPO role is evolving. Or the head of product role is also evolving. I think a lot of it is morphing more into the GM model where you're running not just product management but also perhaps PM and engineering, and design to a certain extent and data science too. You're essentially becoming the overall technical product leader at the company.

(00:38:27):
The reason why I feel that is happening is because it's all about accountability. It's about who has the single threaded leadership model where this person can make all the decisions when it comes to trade offs and running the roadmaps and all of that kind of stuff. It's not ideal, by the way, in all cases. Because what that means is, for somebody to be doing that, that person has to be really, really good at all those other functions too so that everyone who is in their organization respects that. Otherwise people feel like I'm the second class citizen in this model where this person doesn't know anything about, whatever; my function and so on. So it's harder, but I do feel that for optimization around decision making, around having a single threaded leadership and accountability, I feel like that's the direction where the product leadership role itself is going more and more. At least based on my experience.

Lenny (00:39:19):
Is your sense that maybe CPO might fade away as a title and GMs become the common path across companies?

Manik Gupta (00:39:26):
If you were to push me on this, I would say that's probably the direction we will go. I think it's interesting to also think about CTO. If you look at the CTO roles versus SVP of engineering or a VP of engineering, I think it's an interesting debate too, what's happening with CTO roles. If a company is organized purely functionally, I think that's absolutely the right call. But as companies are changing and thinking about how they drive more accountability and more business units and so on, I just feel it probably will become more GM oriented. That does not mean that the VP product is going to go away or the VP engineering is going to go away. I think those roles will still stay. But the C-level title, reporting into the CEO but you're just running that one function; if I look at over time, maybe that role is lot less prevalent than what we have right now.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Do you think that's partly because there's this weird overlap between CPO and CEO, and there's often tension of who's leading the product? Is that something you've seen?

Manik Gupta (00:40:24):
Yeah. I think that's definitely an interesting one as well. I mean, if you think about it, just based on my experience, what does the CPO really do? What is their job description? I think it's useful to think through that. Generally speaking, and again, we can always talk in generalizations because that's how you should think. And every company is unique. But generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans. Like, "Oh, we'll do this, we'll do that," but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision.

(00:41:09):
Then the second big part of a CPO job is execution of the roadmap on the priorities. People sometimes think that, hey, I get to a C-level position. I don't have to worry about execution. Absolutely not. If you're a CPO in particular, even the CTO and the head of engineering, execution matters a lot. The operational excellence. Because things are so complex. I mean, we are in a situation where a lot of people are working remotely, there are all these different tool sets, there are all these different technologies that are coming up, you have different competitors. Execution is super important. And if people don't understand that that's a big part of their job when they get to the senior level, I think they're mistaken. The execution is another one.

(00:41:50):
The third is, for a CPO, especially for a tech company, because you are really driving the product roadmap, it's a very leveraged job. Meaning you have to really work with all your other peers, whether the marketing person, or the sales person, or the business unit person and so on, and just make sure that you are really even deeply connected in terms of what is really needed, so that your product roadmap is how things are going to actually come to life. It's a very cross-functional, on steroids kind of job in that sense.

(00:42:19):
In terms of the CEO, CPO, I think the important thing again is... And this is actually advice I've given to CEOs of some companies as well, when they first start looking for a VP of product or a CPO. This is almost like a questionnaire that I give them. The first question I ask the CEO is, what do you want to do? That's the most important question. Because a lot of times the CEO has either been the technical founder, or they have been the product founder. They can be a sales founder too. All that is fine. But what do you want to spend your time on? Because if you are going to get a CPO or a VP of product and then still want to own the product roadmap and own the execution, then don't do that. Because what is that person going to do? That's the first question that I tend to clarify between a CEO who's looking for a CPO or VP of product.

(00:43:10):
Then the other thing is really about, are you trying to optimize for process? Are you optimizing for strategy? Are you optimizing for team building and attraction? I think that's a really big one. Sometimes you have to get the right level of leader to attract more talent to the team. Because people say, "Oh, this person is working there. Now I want to go work in their organization." How do you think about engineering and data science and design? How do you think about GM and operations? There are a bunch of all these things in terms of the design that you need to do before you decide whether VP of product, CPO is somebody you want to get and what kind of person you want to get.

(00:43:43):
I think that's where the intersection of the work between this... especially for a tech company, the CEO, CPO have to be... And even the CTO I would throw in the mix. That has to be very clearly articulated, otherwise it creates a lot of confusion. Those are some of the things, at least that I observe from different patterns and different companies that I've worked with and also guided and advised, those are things that always come up.

Lenny (00:44:06):
It's interesting how much similarity there is to that experience as there is to the first PM at a company. It feels like they have to have the same conversations with the founder. What do you want to work on? What am I going to take on? How do we avoid stepping on each other's toes the whole time?

Manik Gupta (00:44:21):
That's actually a... I never thought about it that way, Lenny. I think that's a really good point. You're totally right. Obviously, if you're at a bigger company, then you're looking for a VP of product. Or if you're a super big company, then you're looking for a CPO. But you're right. The first product hire that you make as a founder, you'll pretty much have the same conversations to ensure that there are clear swim lanes and accountability for that group.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Interesting. I want to make sure to ask you, as kind of a big deal leader of product at larger companies, I'm curious, what do you look for in PMs that are looking to get promoted, or just deciding somebody's ready for promotion or ready for more responsibility? What do you look for and what should people focus on if they want to come across as promotion material?

Manik Gupta (00:45:01):
I'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish. Because they're a package. And if you just look at one versus the other, then I think you end up making a mistake. Usually. On the what, I think the what is usually more objective. What I look for... And again, it depends on the level of the person. Don't try to calibrate someone based early in their career. You have to think through that. That they're in learning phase. If they're more senior than you have to of course calibrate them differently. But ultimately, if I were to boil it down on the what, it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them. They may not have come up with the hypothesis. That's fine. Somebody else could have come up with it, it doesn't matter. But they believed in it, they rallied the team behind it, they drove towards it and created impact.

(00:45:58):
The impact not necessarily always has to be positive. It could also be a lot of stuff that we learned, but we learned from it and then we moved on and we did the next rev. By the time we did the next rev, we were smarter about it. Clear demonstrated impact from an end to end product cycle to me is probably one of the better indicators of readiness for someone to take on more. And you basically want to give them more, because now they have a pattern of doing things properly. That's one.

(00:46:23):
On the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity. Think of the flip side. PMs who don't create clarity is such a time sink and the teams struggle so much. I'm sure all of us, when we think about back in the day, maybe we were in that position at some point. But we also worked with folks who were always confused and didn't really summarize, or didn't really follow up, or didn't really create that level of clarity in terms of what we need to do and so on, and how broken that felt. People who can create the clarity and then have the energy around them to get things done, I think that's the how in my opinion. Which is really important for determining somebody's career trajectory.

(00:47:11):
Then the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them? Do people at some point, as they go up and become more senior, do people want to work for them? Ultimately people make choices. And if you have a bunch of smart people and they're making smart choices and they're choosing this person to follow or to be with and work with them and reach out to them, and you keep hearing things about, hey, so and so wants to work with this person because this person is amazing; there is a ton of value in that.

(00:47:45):
Those are the three things that, if I were to really boil it down, not looking at a certain level, I think I always look for those attributes.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Those are awesome. So simple and clear and succinct. I like the way that you framed it as followership versus leadership. There's a lot of PM attributes leadership, and there's something really nice about just a way to understand that as how many people are following you and excited to work on the things that you're trying to get them to work on. That's very cool.

(00:48:11):
Along the same lines, when you think about PMs that had an inflection point in their career, do you find that there's anything correlated with something that leads to a large inflection in the progress of someone's career where they all of a sudden started doing incredibly better?

Manik Gupta (00:48:24):
I've gone through a few inflection points myself, and almost always they've happened because something in the organization changed, so I got a shot. There's always that luck factor, going back to the first question that we discussed.

(00:48:37):
But generally speaking, I think the inflection points happen in two places. One is when someone has really successfully changed the dynamic, or the trajectory rather, of a particular product. That's a huge inflection point. That doesn't happen very often, to be fair. But when it happens, you know it. You know, as a leader, this person worked on this and they actually led this change and now we are playing a different game. We are playing a bigger game, we are playing a different game, all of that kind of stuff.

(00:49:16):
In other words, what I'm saying is the inflection point for a career is correlated strongly with the inflection point in the product. If you can connect those, the cause and effect... If there's causality and not just correlation, if there's causality in that, I think that absolutely means that you've got a winner. And you really want to bet on them and you have to give them a lot more to do, because they have the ability to do it. That's one.

(00:49:38):
The second is, oftentimes as people go up in their career, they start managing teams. They become a manager, and then you become a manager of managers, and then you become more senior. I mean, that's the organizational trajectory that happens. One inflection point that I've seen is, when you go from being a manager, a first line manager, to becoming a manager of managers, and if you're able to navigate that with very strong effectiveness, then you know. If you're their manager or if you're their leader you know this person has got their act together. Because managing ICs is so different from managing managers, because then you now need to create a structure. You need to be able to determine how much you delegate. How do you coach? How do coach your managers to do the right thing? If you see somebody making that transition effectively... And you have to give them some time, but if you see that and you know that they're actually doing it, and again, a lot of followership, a lot of other things are happening, good things are happening, then you know they're at that inflection point where they're ready to take on more.

(00:50:41):
Both product inflection in terms of real output and this management prowess inflection in terms of being able to effectively lead going from one step to another, a manager to becoming a manager of managers; I think those are the two places where I feel like, if I see somebody doing well, I know they're ready to put more onto them.

Lenny (00:51:00):
Do you find that second piece is this filter for PMs that do well in this manager manager role and go on to do better and better and then a lot just fall away because they can't handle that?

Manik Gupta (00:51:12):
Yeah, I think so. Maybe I'm a little bit more traditionist on this point. I know there are other schools of thought on this, which I respect. Which is there are a lot of times where people are like, "Well, oftentimes the best PMs are PMs who are IC PMs. They have this crazy, incredible, unbounded energy and they don't want to waste their time on management and whatnot and do that. Because a large part of a PM's job, by the way, is managing by influence. PMs typically don't have large organizations. In fact, one of the most leveraged teams in almost every company... Because you talk about PM manage ratios, PM design ratios, they're never one-ish to one, or one-ish to five, or one-ish to six. Sometimes it' going to be one-ish to 10. At Google it used to be one-ish to eight to one-ish to 10.

(00:51:52):
I personally see that transition... If somebody's making that transition successfully and they're getting good scores out of it and delivering the product and the output of the team is significant, I definitely see that as a good filter criteria for someone whom we can bet on.

Lenny (00:52:06):
Do you find there's common habits or pitfalls PMs make to shoot themselves in the foot in their career, especially early on?

Manik Gupta (00:52:14):
Oh, I see that all the time. There's a few of the things that I have picked up. And by the way, I was doing this too early on and I learned the hard way. The first one I would talk about is you are early in your career and everyone expects you to just manage things and manage the process and all of that. Make sure that trains are running on time and all of that. Which, by the way, is really important for an early in career PM to understand. That that's actually a big part of your job. Let's not over glamorize a PM. A large part of being a PM initially is just basically doing whatever the team needs you to do. But I think one of the pitfalls of that is, if you start putting process over progress, that's a problem.

(00:52:58):
What I mean by that is, you want to introduce process into almost everything that the team does and not be flexible on shipping things out there and all the things that can come in the way of progress. If process is helping progress, great. But if process is hurting progress, you should not be the person saying, "No, no, no, no. We can't do it, because I'm just so married to the process. Because as a PM, that's what I own." I mean, as a PM you don't write code typically, you don't write design specs, you write product specs. Sometimes you feel like, what is the set of attributes that I own? Especially early in career PMs. And you're like, "I own this process. I own this weekly standup meeting, or I own this sprint planning, or whatever." And then you get so married to it that you forget the fact that that's just a means to an end and the end is what you're going to be actually measured on. That's one mistake that I see people making early on.

(00:53:48):
The second one is becoming really too self-centered. It's all about me, not the team. I'm the PM. There's this myth that keeps going around. The PM is the CEO of the product. That's one of the most incorrect things in the world. The PM is an enabler. I said earlier, it's a leverage job. Your job is to really make the team successful. Of course you have to have the product thinking and the roadmap and all of that, but sometimes this can go to their head. Then people become too self-centered and that's a red flag.

(00:54:21):
Then the third one would be just not admitting your mistakes or learning from them. Early in career, the only thing you should optimize for is learning. Sure, you'll make a lot of mistakes. You don't know much yet. You're just coming into this journey and you should be humble and you should be learning and you should be saying, "Oops, I screwed up over here." And that's okay. That's fine. And by the way, if you work in a company where that is not accepted, you should not work in that company. What's the point? You should really be optimizing for learning and learning from other people. And people should be saying, "Yeah, don't worry. It's okay. You made the mistake. Learn from it. Don't make the mistake again. That's fine." But that's the kind of culture you want to choose for yourself.

(00:55:01):
Those are the three pitfalls that I see people get into, especially early on in their career.

Lenny (00:55:05):
You touched on how different companies work in different ways and look for different things in different PMs. And something I wanted to ask you is just to chat a bit about the difference between working at Google versus Uber versus Microsoft as a PM, and also just generally how product is built differently at these companies. It's something I'm trying to do with this podcast as much as possible. Just give an overview of what product is like at different companies. You've worked at three of the biggest, and so I'm curious to hear what you can share around that.

Manik Gupta (00:55:32):
Yeah. It's actually really interesting. I mean, all the three companies are so different. Google, the core DNA of the company was very much engineering. In fact, there used to be a framework which was around technology insights drive innovation. It was always about what is the best tech we can come up with, which is going to indeed drive innovation, and have a longish view so that the market will get there. That was the Google philosophy always. As a PM, your job at Google... It might have changed in the last six, seven years that I've not been there, but at least when I was there from 2008 to 2015, especially working on Google Maps, it was all about how do you take good long-term bets grounded in strong technical insights, and then use the power of Google Search distribution to really get your product out there. That was it.

(00:56:33):
On the Maps team, our innovation was pretty much around crowdsourcing everyone's location signals for traffic. Huge, huge accomplishment. We had the best traffic models in the world. And then being able to do this crazy route optimization for driving directions. Then on top of that, we had the search stack, which came from Google Search anyway. So that you can search for any address, any business and so on.

(00:56:55):
Anyway, as a PM it was partnering very closely with engineers and really amplifying the engineer's ideas and so on. I think at that point also a lot of Google PMs were very technical. Very, very technical. Because that was just part for the course. It was expected that you will be able to at least have engineering discussions. A large part of what I did as a PM at Google, especially initially, was getting into the technical details with my engineers and really geeking out on what we can do. That was the Google model.

(00:57:25):
By the way, one thing I should say about Google before I go to... At Google as a PM, at least all the way up to the time even when I became a director, I never had to think about business models, man. Never. It was fascinating. You were in this weird state where you could just build and have the consumer traction and all of that, but you never thought about P&L, never thought about revenue and so on.

(00:57:48):
Then I landed at Uber, which was very different. Uber was very operations, very business driven, very P&L. In fact, one of the most incredible things that Uber did was they had a dashboard which every employee in the company could look at, and it had last week's revenue, last week's number of trips that we did, and you could slice and dice it and all of that. I think that changed over time as we became a public company and so on. But the point was that it was really in your face all the time. When there were weekly newsletters sent out, it was all about growth, it was all about business, all of that kind of stuff. It was very operational and business, so as a PM over there it was a lot about managing a bunch more stakeholders. The operations teams, the marketing teams, the policy teams and so on. And how do you work with them to deploy your product into each of these markets. Of course then a large chunk of your work was still working with the engineering team. It was different in that sense.

(00:58:47):
I think at Uber the other thing was it was also much more of a real time business. I mean, Google was also real time. Google Maps was real time. Billions of users were using it. But Uber was... every day there was something going on in the market and you had to keep on that hustle in terms of how do you make sure that your staying competitive, your product is working well, there are no outages. All of that kind of stuff was really important.

(00:59:09):
Then finally, on Microsoft... I mean, Microsoft has been around for quite a while. The company went through so many different things and then over the last several years, especially under Satya's leadership, it has done so well. Incredibly well in terms of how the company has changed the culture, the kind of products that they have in the market, the traction they have in the market.

(00:59:29):
I think I would describe Microsoft as both... first and foremost, it's a very strong tech company. The engineers here are incredible. Oh my God. I am so privileged to work with some of the best engineers that I've worked with in my career. At the same time there's a lot of legacy. There are a lot of products that have been around for a really long time, which is good and bad. The good part is that they have seen pretty much every pattern there is to see. In fact, they came up with a lot of those patterns themselves. The bad part sometimes can be that change is hard. How do you convince people that we're going to go down a different path? As a PM, a lot of it is around bringing outside in perspective, bringing clarity of like, "Hey, this is how it has actually worked somewhere else." Bring a specific example. Let's try it out and see how that works.

(01:00:13):
The final thing I would say about it is the company is so grounded in trust. If there's one word that I would say about Microsoft is trust. They really care a lot about customers. Customers trust Microsoft a lot. I've been in some of the customer meetings myself and I can totally hear what customers say. It's all about trust. They expect resilience, they expect the products to work, and they expect that when they have a problem on the surface, that Microsoft will take care of it. They built that over time. A lot of that goes into your mind as a PM when you're working in that company, that a lot of the stuff that we are doing here is to really help our customers.

Lenny (01:00:48):
Going back to your point about company-product fit, these cultures and the way they work just fits perfectly with the thing they end up building. I wonder which one comes first.

Manik Gupta (01:00:57):
It's true. That's a whole nother conversation we can have at some point. I have a lot of thoughts on that. But I'll just echo what you just said, which is that's the reason why it's so important for companies, when they embark on new initiatives, to be really, really thoughtful. Is this the right area for us to get into? Or rather, what are the conditions and the reasons why we are getting into something? We have to be super clear on that. Because if the starting conditions are not right, then you will just trash the team. The team will keep working on something and people will never find the right internal fit. So that's super important.

Lenny (01:01:35):
You worked on Google Maps and Uber, which I imagine you still use often and maybe billions of people use every day. Is there a feature that you wish that you built back when you were on the team, or that you think should be killed, that annoys you about either of those products?

Manik Gupta (01:01:50):
Wow. Okay. This is a super interesting one. I don't know if that's something that I could have built at Google Maps, but one of the things that's interesting is the self-driving technology has just not gotten there fast enough. I feel like the best and brightest actually worked on it and are still working on it and it will get there. I'm a big believer. But of course the timelines have shifted for various reasons, because it is a really hard problem. It's actually really interesting to see what Cruise is doing right now in SF. They have started the pilots and so on, so I'm really happy to see some progress happening. I know Waymo's been doing a bunch of this already.

(01:02:29):
But it would've been amazing. One of the things that we used to talk about all the time at Google on Maps was how would we design a navigation product when people are in self-driving cars? We had some really interesting ideas at that point, but we never got to it. Not because we didn't prioritize it, but the technology isn't there. I still keep a close watch on that and see at what point are we going to get there. It's going to take years, but it is just such a different paradigm. It's like computers talking to computers, algorithms talking to other algorithms. Then there's a human in the mix in terms of serving the human at the end, but it's like the human is not initiating that much. It's just, stuff is happening around it.

(01:03:08):
Anyway, that's one thing that is unfinished business, if you will, in my mind. And hopefully, as the technology comes together, that will happen.

Lenny (01:03:16):
Amazing. Manik, you've been extremely generous with your time. Just two last quick questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out maybe, or learn more about what you're doing? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Manik Gupta (01:03:28):
Yeah. You can find me on Twitter, you can find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two places. I have not been very active on both those recently. I've not been active as a contributor, but I'm very active on those two platforms as a consumer. If you have any questions, if you have any thoughts, would love to hear from you, so please send me a note.

(01:03:47):
In terms of how listeners can be helpful, I just want to learn what's new and what's out there. I've had the privilege of being in these incredible companies. The reason why I'm still doing what I'm doing is because I still want to learn. If there are better patterns out there that you're seeing, particularly around how to build products, would love to know if there are other ways people think about finding product market fit. Because that's such an elusive thing that I just keep thinking a lot about. If you have some techniques, some tips, some best practices that you have learned and it has worked for you, please, please, please reach out to me. I would love to learn that, because it's so important for us to keep having that conversation.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Awesome. It's always such a pleasure chatting. I always learn a ton. And this did not disappoint, so thank you again for being here.

Manik Gupta (01:04:30):
Lenny, thank you so much for asking all these questions and giving me the opportunity to share my learnings over the years. Thank you.

Lenny (01:04:36):
Absolutely my pleasure. That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce. One of the most legendary launch events in startup history. Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?

Marc Benioff (00:09):
I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17):
Your stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.

Marc Benioff (00:24):
I actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30):
AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?

Marc Benioff (00:38):
I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44):
As a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (00:50):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01):
Today, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

(03:57):
Marc, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Marc Benioff (04:00):
Excited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:04):
I'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-

Marc Benioff (04:26):
You.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:26):
... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?

Marc Benioff (04:28):
There's a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Marc Benioff (04:32):
That all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, "Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, "Hey, I need to go and take some time off."

(05:13):
So I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:00):
So one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?

Marc Benioff (06:09):
It's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.

(07:10):
Okay. So you can just imagine like you're like, "Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie." There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.

(07:56):
He says to me, "Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?" I'm like, "Yes, sir. I will do that." He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, "I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that." It's this cool device. I'm like, "That's such a cool screen. Steve." He goes, "Oh, thanks so much." I go, "Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs." "No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not."

(08:34):
That's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this." So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, "I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him." He's like, "Come down here right away."

(09:03):
So, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now." I'm like, "Okay. What are they?" He go, "Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over." "Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir." "Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce." The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. "And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do." I'm like, "Yes, sir. What is it?" "You better go build an application economy." "An application economy?" "Yes." "What does that mean?" "I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out."

(09:55):
It was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, "I think he wants me to build an app store." At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.

(10:34):
So I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, "This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other." Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, "Hey, come down and see me." This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, "I'll be right down."

(11:08):
I get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, "I brought you all down here today." It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, "And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store." All of our people go, "Huh." They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, "Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even..."

(11:51):
Then, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, "Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?" He goes, "Of course." Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, "Steve, I'm going to give you a gift." "Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?" "Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL." He's like, "Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much." That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.

Lenny Rachitsky (12:59):
There's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.

Marc Benioff (13:08):
He is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, "I'll go look at it for you." So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, "Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea."

(13:41):
Then, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, "Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought." He goes, "Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined." It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:14):
I feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.

Marc Benioff (14:16):
Yeah. Oh, no, I have hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:19):
Yes, you can.

Marc Benioff (14:20):
I have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (14:21):
Oh, man.

Marc Benioff (14:22):
Yeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:24):
By the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, "You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace."

Marc Benioff (14:30):
Oh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:31):
Yeah, he did.

Marc Benioff (14:35):
He's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, "Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career." I'm like, "I love it, Steve." "No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great." It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:06):
Yeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.

Marc Benioff (15:12):
He was rarely wrong, by the way, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:14):
He was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.

Marc Benioff (15:44):
I think you read one of my books, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:46):
I know the history of a lot of these things.

Marc Benioff (15:48):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:49):
It's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.

Marc Benioff (15:54):
It was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, "The end of software is near," and all kinds of other... "No software," and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, "Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software." So we have picketers outside of the streets.

(16:50):
Anyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:06):
I love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.

Marc Benioff (18:10):
It was crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:12):
I love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-

Marc Benioff (18:18):
"Frivolous" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:21):
So what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word "Salesforce" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?

Marc Benioff (18:42):
Well, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, "It's just going to be about Agentforce." I'm trying to think about, "What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.

(19:25):
We're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?

(20:04):
I'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, "We'll cut ads for you." They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?

(20:35):
I am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?

(20:58):
I'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.

(21:33):
I'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:03):
There's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.

Marc Benioff (22:31):
Well, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.

(23:15):
I think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, "What is my beginner's mind?" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, "What could work?" rather than saying, "Oh, I know what is going to work," or, "This is the one thing that is going to definitely work," or, "We have to do this."

(24:10):
As soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, "Here, we have to do all these things." Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, "There's six things I really want to get done," but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.

(24:56):
Number four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.

(25:23):
The last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.

(26:57):
I love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?

Marc Benioff (27:18):
Well, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, "All good things. Steve Jobs." I said, "What did he do over here?" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.

(28:04):
I've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, "You know, I think we got to go."

(28:38):
Anyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.

(29:06):
That music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:41):
By the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.

Marc Benioff (29:41):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:49):
I don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].

Marc Benioff (29:48):
They are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:53):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, "Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years."

Marc Benioff (30:11):
We are too complicated. I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:12):
Okay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.

Marc Benioff (30:25):
Wow, I didn't even know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:27):
Roughly.

Marc Benioff (30:29):
I actually never look at the stock.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (30:31):
I find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.

(31:05):
I am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:47):
I want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word "agent," I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, "What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?

Marc Benioff (32:09):
Yeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, "Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.

(32:51):
That is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.

(33:22):
I'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, "Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent."

(33:58):
Then, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.

(34:45):
That is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, "Hey, did you drink the water?" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, "Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:25):
There's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.

Marc Benioff (35:43):
Yeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (36:09):
Speaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, "Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime." When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, "Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?"

Marc Benioff (36:33):
Well, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, "Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.

(37:18):
This week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, "Wow, this is going to get more and more intense." One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.

(38:00):
So that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.

(38:29):
When you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:21):
You mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.

Marc Benioff (39:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:34):
That was another domain name that you owned.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Well, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (39:36):
My view is blocked.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Oh, I'll go grab him.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:52):
Totally. Okay. Let's check it out.

Marc Benioff (39:54):
There he is. Ugh.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:55):
Show and tell Segment in the podcast.

Marc Benioff (39:55):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:59):
Oh, cute.

Marc Benioff (40:00):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:00):
That's a big old Einstein.

Marc Benioff (40:02):
That's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:12):
Very cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, "Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents." I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, "Marc Benioff says everyone is not working," but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?

Marc Benioff (40:35):
Well, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.

(41:06):
Then, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.

(41:56):
Look, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:21):
So what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?

Marc Benioff (42:27):
Right now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:31):
That touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-

Marc Benioff (42:57):
Yeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
Mm.

Marc Benioff (43:01):
So we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined "beta" and "data" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.

(43:51):
Then, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, "Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now." By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.

(44:18):
Great entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, "Great." We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, "Now, we want to buy it back." Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.

(44:56):
I think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.

(45:20):
I think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, "I'm just going to play the clarinet." For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, "Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder." It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:02):
Speaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, "Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes," and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?

Marc Benioff (46:35):
Sure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, "Whoa, what are we going to do?" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.

(47:12):
One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.

(47:33):
Now, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.

(47:58):
So I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, "Oh, boy." If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.

(48:51):
It was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.

(49:17):
I was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.

(49:39):
My friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, "There is no linear success." So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:33):
One of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.

Marc Benioff (50:54):
Well, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, "Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name." I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.

(51:30):
If you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, "Better, better, better. Never best." It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.

(52:10):
So we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (52:47):
I'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (52:54):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing." In some ways, you have to be saying, "I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation." Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?

(53:18):
See, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, "Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?" I said, "Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-

Lenny Rachitsky (53:54):
For $75.

Marc Benioff (53:54):
For $75, and they said, "Thank you for..." and then they said, "Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?" I'm like, "No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me." I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, "What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job."

(54:45):
So they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, "What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Absolutely.

Marc Benioff (55:22):
I jumped on that one little thought. "Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to..." It's like, "No, that's what you want." By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:43):
Why?

Marc Benioff (55:43):
I want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, "Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them." Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:23):
He's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.

Marc Benioff (56:26):
Amazing,

Lenny Rachitsky (56:27):
Amazing.

Marc Benioff (56:27):
No one like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:29):
Yeah.

Marc Benioff (56:29):
Never seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:34):
Same. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.

Marc Benioff (56:40):
Oh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:49):
Same, Marc Benioff.

Marc Benioff (56:50):
We're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:53):
I feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.

# AI and product management | Marily Nika (Meta, Google)

## Transcript

Marily Nika (00:00):
There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high-level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it.

Lenny (00:28):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Marily Nika. Marily teaches the most popular course on Maven on AI and product management. She's currently product lead at Meta focusing on Metaverse, avatars and identity. Prior to Meta, she was at Google for over eight years working on Google Glass, computer vision and machine learning around speech recognition. In our conversation, we touch on what PMs should be paying attention to when it comes to what's happening in AI. We talk about a bunch of resources that'll help you get started in the world of AI. How AI tools available today can already help you do your job better as a PM.

(01:12):
We also get relatively technical into what exactly is a model, how are models trained, all kinds of fun stuff like that. Enjoy this conversation with Marily Nika after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:53):
This episode is brought to you by EPPO. EPPO is a next-generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on EPPO to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth in stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPPO does all that and more, delivering results quickly and avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(02:41):
EPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPPO supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out EPPO at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(03:06):
Marilee, welcome to the podcast.

Marily Nika (03:08):
Thank you. Hello, thank you for having me.

Lenny (03:10):
It's very much my pleasure. We've interacted a little bit on Twitter. We've never actually talked before just right now. I've seen your course just all over the place, your course on AI and PM. And so I just thought it'd be really fun to have you on and help us all understand what the hell is happening in AI and especially AI and product. So thanks again for being here.

Marily Nika (03:33):
Yes, thank you. I'm really excited.

Lenny (03:36):
I would love your help as a former full-time PM/everyone listening that is a current PM, to help us understand what is going on with AI and product tech in general and tools in general. Move really fast, if you're trying to pay attention to what's happening, it's really hard to stay up to date on where things are going and it feels especially hard in AI.

(03:57):
It feels like there's just something coming out every day. And so I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is just like what media do you pay attention to stay on top of what's happening and what's new and what's interesting in the world of AI and machine learning?

Marily Nika (04:11):
As you know very well, subscribing to newsletters is something that's really impactful. And of course, I subscribe to your newsletter, but I am a big, big, big fan of the download by MIT Ecology Review or Atelier. And they're not necessarily AI-centric, but what I'm advocating for and what I'm telling people is that in the future everything will be AI by default. So even if you have something that's technology focused, you'll see a lot of AI starting to get sprinkled in there.

Lenny (04:40):
I want to follow up on what you just said there, but maybe we'll save it a little bit. Maybe going in a different direction first, what do you think is overhyped in the space of AI right now? What do you think is under hyped and undervalued?

Marily Nika (04:52):
I would like to discuss strategy between, which is both under hyped and over hyped at the same time. I was reading this article this morning where there are writers complaining and they're very, very fearful and they think, "Oh, writing online is going to die. Everything we've studying for is going to be replaced. They're going to take our jobs and so on." And I'm just like, "No, no, no. Charging PT and technology is enhancing our work. It's enhancing us. It does not steal from us." So that's what comes across right now. And there are other things that are under hype, but obviously ChatGPT is amazing. I'm using it day to day, but there are other things AI can do in an amazing manner.

(05:34):
I was reading a research article the other day that said that AI can now detect place. So lie detection, whether I is for security reasons or at work or anything like that is now possible. So I encourage people to go to these newsletters and go to these online blogs, 10 prints and so on, and just read what's happening. It's not all about chat reading, there's more, there's more about AI, but you should read a lot.

Lenny (05:58):
You mentioned that you use ChatGPT in your work life. Talk about that. What are you actually using it for?

Marily Nika (06:04):
Even when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like. So what I do is I literally go to ChatGPT and I say rewrite this mission statement from me and even the first try produces something which is fantastic, so that.

(06:34):
Number two, it helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it. And then the last thing that it does is it provides ideas for you whether AI enhanced. So I just use a day-to-day, even [inaudible 00:07:00] day-to-day workflow, but I'm not making it do my job for me, I'm asking it after I have already had a mission in my head and what it is I want to do.

Lenny (07:10):
So is the way you're approaching it is you just put in, come up with a better mission statement then and then you give it your version of the mission statement?

Marily Nika (07:18):
Exactly.

Lenny (07:19):
Interesting. And you're saying that that comes up with a better mission statement than the one you had?

Marily Nika (07:25):
It's better because the mission statement is going to be read by all disciplines. It's not just going to be read by PMs that already have a lot of context and understand. It's going to be read by leadership, by junior people, by stakeholders, by other departments, by competitors. And you needed to be on Orient ending the words that are meant to be understood by everyone. Even a kid could understand and they would get inspired by you as well.

Lenny (07:49):
And then you also said he use it for personas. How do you actually frame that prompt with ChatGPT?

Marily Nika (07:55):
Let's say you're working for a specific product area and you know want to create some fitness band, so you would say something like, who would be interested in the fitness band that doesn't have a screen? And it will provide a bulleted list all of people like, hey, young professionals are that they're interested but don't have enough time. People that do not want to charge their wearables every day. Then the list goes on. It's just fantastic.

Lenny (08:24):
You were talking about how you think the future of AI is, it's the default and is what you mean there that it's basically baked into every product we use and it helps the user do better things, it helps the product work better. Is that what you mean or is it something else?

Marily Nika (08:39):
I believe that ballpark managers will be AI product managers in the future. And this is because we see all products needing to have a personalized experience, a recommender system that is actually good. I mean you cannot watch to Netflix, you cannot even watch a movie without needing that. After you watch White Lotus or Stranger Things, you will want something similar to watch. You're not going to want a romantic thing to be suggested or recommended to you.

(09:06):
Also, automation is another thing. We need to keep improving on society. We need to keep making technological advancements. You're not going to be able to do that if you don't have an AI centric view in every sector that you're working on.

Lenny (09:20):
When you say that every PM will be an AI PM is your thinking that you'll be using AI tools in your job as a PM or that you'll be building AI into everything you're building with? How do you think about that?

Marily Nika (09:35):
I think it's that you will need to get comfortable with having a partner that's a research scientist and you will need to understand that these people can produce a smart model. They'll be able to do some automation, some personalization, some recommendations on. In a lot of people, truly uncomfortable, a lot of people don't know how to approach the researchers. A lot of people don't like the uncertainty that research has. A lot of PMs are very, very used to, "Okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch." Whereas when you're working with research, it's more like we're going to try this and then in a year if it doesn't work out we're going to shut the written down and repeated completing [inaudible 00:10:17]. So I feel that if people get more used to uncertainty and research, things are going to be good in the end for them.

Lenny (10:28):
I thought you were comparing ChatGPT as a researcher you're working with, but you're actually saying people will have PhD researchers on their teams helping them build models into their product to make their product better. Is that what you're saying?

Marily Nika (10:43):
Correct. This is exactly what I'm-

Lenny (10:45):
Interesting.

Marily Nika (10:47):
And from a product perspective I can imagine like three bubbles in my head. So you want to find the intersection both something that's desirable by users, something that is going to be a viable business and something that is going to be feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective. And then when you have that, it's just going to be a capacity product for desktop launch that you can run with. So yeah, whenever I say researcher, research scientist that can produce an AI machine learning model.

Lenny (11:15):
Wow. Didn't think about how every cross-functional team might end up with a research scientist. Interesting, interesting. For PMs who are curious about learning how to do this stuff, what are a couple things that PMs today who have no experience with AI, what can they do to start learning how to build AI tooling into their products, understand what the hell's happening in the space of AI?

Marily Nika (11:40):
This is a good question and I guess the message I want to pass is you shouldn't be overwhelmed by these technologies if you don't have a technical background because you can learn these things and as a PM you'll never need to actually train or code. Also, even if you want to train, there are no code approaches for training models. But to answer the question, if you're working on any product, you can always sprinkle in a smarter feature. So you can make it more secure, you can personalize it, you can enhance it with fraud detection, you can make it more ethical. If it's healthcare, you can make it faster, you can make it more accurate. If it's shopping, you can create better accommodations. Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior with users can be improved with AI.

(12:30):
So I guess it's all about changing the mindset of PMs. Taking a step back and just thinking about, okay, I have all this data that's just lying and sitting around what is it that I can do with it? I've been meeting PMs that said, "Oh, we're not collecting any data, we're [inaudible 00:12:46] dashboard." So even that is a huge first step towards AI. And then just start thinking about it, where you could deal, get a data science intern and just see what they are going to do. There's just so much people can do.

Lenny (13:00):
So say you want to start investing in some sort of model, some sort of AI within your team, you're saying maybe hire data scientists who can help you start to build something that you can start integrating. Is that your advice on the first step of once you start, you want to start getting serious about building some sort of AI component.

Marily Nika (13:19):
There is something called the shiny object trap and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI". Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it. And there's a definition I like giving. I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem. So if you want to get into AI PM figure out what the problem is that you will get a data scientist to create a model for solving, but there needs to be a problem, there needs to be audience, there needs to be a user and a pin going for it.

Lenny (14:11):
What are signs that AI may not be a good approach to solving a problem? You said that, and this happened on a lot of my teams, oh we're going to build a really cool model, it's going to do something really smart in this case and it often ended up being a very low ROI investment and took six months to a year before you even knew what the hell what was happening. Do you have any thoughts on signs that maybe this isn't a place you should be putting a lot of time into AI versus this is definitely an opportunity. Yes, we should do this, invest a lot of time into this.

Marily Nika (14:42):
Don't do it for your MVP. It makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with using powerful machines that are going take weeks to train. This is because if you have an MVP and you just want to get buy-in for an idea or feature that may use AI in the future, take it, create a little figma prototype and just show it some users, just fake what the AI is going to be doing. So a lot of young early stage entrepreneurs reach out to me and they say, "Oh, should train this model to do this and that because we want to prove that there is a market." "No, do not use AI. You should use AI where you think you already have some data or data from an adjacent product that you feel you can leverage for your own product to create something that's meaningful, recommendation automation, what we talking about. But not for an MVP. Please people, this is my advice.

Lenny (15:46):
How much data do you think you need for AI ML to have a chance to contribute? You have a heuristic of if you have anything less than this, it's not going to work at all.

Marily Nika (15:59):
This is a good question and it honestly depends on what I'm what I'm trying to do. If you're trying to classify, if the photo is a category dog, obviously even if you have, I don't know like 15, 20 labeled photos, what's going to work. But if you want to create voice recognizers or complicated NLP applications, you're going to need thousands of [inaudible 00:16:19] of data. And this what's making this not be easy? AI systems are not easy to develop. There is a life cycle of a machine learning project and after scoping you need to figure out, "Oh god, how much data do we need? Where do I find this data as well, how much data?" Sometimes I've seen people synthesizing their own fake data just so that they can have something to train with and test their models. But the exact amount is hard to be defined, especially from a [inaudible 00:16:50]. I'm sure data scientists have a different opinion.

Lenny (16:53):
Yeah, my guess is most startups are going to have nowhere near enough data to build their own model and make it something really interesting. So do you have a thought on when it makes sense to try to build your own model, try to train your own GPT type thing versus use something that's already out there like say GPT or aJourney or all those guys.

Marily Nika (17:17):
If you are a big tech company and you're offering a service that is going to do speech or permission or then it's going to have their own tragedy, you want to use more data and more diverse data to train and retain and train because if you don't then your quality is going to be the same as every other companies. There are agencies that are selling data, packages of data, that are ready so you can get them and train your models. But the question is if everyone takes that exact dataset, then the quality that every single company is producing is going to be the exact same. So you do want to diversify, you do want to collect your own data. And I guess a good question from my prem perspective is when is the quality of your product good enough to lunch?

(18:08):
And that is a really interesting point because it's totally your responsibility as a PM to decide, "Okay, the recognition of whether this folder is a category dog is good enough for the users, it's like 70% accurate, 80% accurate, where is the bar, where do we launch?" And that's why I'm like the AI PM role is so cool because you have problems like that to solve that no one else was tackled before. So it's all on you.

Lenny (18:34):
We've thrown out these words model and we talk about training models. Do you have a good succinct explanation for what a model is for folks that aren't that technical and then just the general idea of training a model. What is a simple way to think of, here is what a model is.

Marily Nika (18:52):
So I have a three-year-old girl and I'm teaching hear about life and everything. So I was recently teaching her about the animals and you explain things to her once or twice, what the mammals is or rhino and so on. But you will end up training your kids brain by repeating the same information again. So you will say, "Hey, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like." And once you've done this enough times, then your kid will see an animal on the street and they'll be able to recognize and say, "Oh yeah, that's like rhino what we're talking about." This is exactly what a model is. The model is like a kid's brain. It has the ability to take an input, which means it has the ability to take an image and say, "Oh I recognize what this is. That looks like a rhino. But I'm 70% sure about this." So you will output the probability as well of the certainty.

Lenny (19:51):
And you said image, but it could be text for say in ChatGPT. In the future I imagine video there's also voice like whisper. That's an awesome explanation. Basically it's like trying to recreate the human brain is a nice way of thinking about it. And then training a model, can you talk about what that means?

Marily Nika (20:08):
The problems of training the model for example is providing a lot of images that are legal and say, "Hey, here's what card looks like, here's what it all looks like," and we're talking about thousands and thousands of data sets for this. And once you do this, there's a process where the model is just processing this information and it's learning, it's finding patterns through it and the patterns are not in the form of, oh if this is gray then this means this. No, it just learns in the smart brain how to identify specific things that we don't even understand. And then it's able to output the probability of whether photo is going to contain the cutter and top.

Lenny (20:49):
Just conceptually what is the output of the training? Is it code that is auto-generated with these decision trees and weights and things like that? Is it a database of weight? Just conceptually what is the output of a training that becomes a model? What's the simplest way to think about that?

Marily Nika (21:05):
So it's what it speaks. Speech is a great example. For example, I'm talking to a device which is like a home system and I say, "Hey, what is the weather like today?" This is going to take my folies and audio and it's going to process it and the output is going to be a transcription. So it's literally going to be text that corresponds to what I sent to it.

Lenny (21:24):
Thinking about the stuff you've worked on at Google, at Meta, anywhere else you've worked on, side projects even, what are some of the cooler applications of AI machine learning that you've worked on, contributed to, or even seen that you can talk about? I imagine there's a lot of sensitive stuff too going on.

Marily Nika (21:40):
One thing I want to talk about is the team I used to work for, Google, which was then the RVR team and they were working on an air glass and actually they had a video on last year's Google IO. They were able to have the Google glass on someone that spoke one language and then this other person was sat in front of them that spoke a different language and the glass will take as an input that audio that came from that other person and it will transcribe it, it will translate it and show it on the screen for that person in their language. So we're talking about the ability for this devices to unlock the borders of communication and that is not science fiction. This is what amazing and mind-blowing, there's no science fiction anymore. These things are real, the technology is here, it's just a matter of connecting the pieces to the puzzle in order to see them coming to life. So I think that one was one of the most impactful things I've ever seen.

Lenny (22:46):
I remember that demo and it was pretty incredible. Okay, so thinking a little more broadly, do you think ChatGPT or just say GPT four or GPT five, GPT six, do you think at some point this will replace product managers? Something I see on Twitter a lot. People are like, "Oh my god, product managements done. This thing made my product requirements document for me." Or you talked about how it makes your mission statement better. Do you think there's a place where PMs aren't necessary anymore?

Marily Nika (23:13):
Oh, absolutely not. As I said, it makes everything better. If anything it's going to free out time for me to do other things that are less tedious. For example, I am running so many projects and they only their peer [inaudible 00:23:27] and the peer [inaudible 00:23:28] have all these areas that are common across all of them. If I had a system that can actually write the continuous stuff for me so that I can focus on more strategic side of things, that would be incredible. It will make us smarter. If [inaudible 00:23:42], you will unlock new areas of product management that we haven't realized that, but are there.

Lenny (23:48):
Are there areas, do you think with your kind of vision of all PMs will be AI PMs, are there areas that you think PMs should invest more skill-wise or areas they should less focus on invest because say some machine learning model is going to do that for them.

Marily Nika (24:04):
I'd like to see people being less overwhelmed, less intimidated, less afraid to start learning how to code, how to train a little model on their own. This is because even if ChatGPT or this no code applications may be able to do this for us, it gives you a different approach, a different mindset, a different if you want confidence to know how things work. And here's a silly example, I was learning how to play the piano when I was young and when my teacher came in I was like, "Oh, I want to learn how to play this cool song." There were some songs that I really liked. And she said, "No, you need to start with a classical music," and I just hated it all the time. And I said, "Why do I have to do this?" Because she said, "If you learn the fundamentals and how you know where things started and the beginning of music, it's going to help you along the way to create music on your own if you want to." And she was right. I just loved it.

(25:00):
So it's the same with coding. I encourage people to just take an online course, understand more, get your hands dirty, pair up with someone else that's in the same boat as you because this is going to give you the skillset to understand how that tool that's going to help you in your day-to-day was even created in the first place instead of blindfoldedly distrusted to do your job.

Lenny (25:23):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, bias and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management including a continuous employee-centric approach. So employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(26:21):
For someone that actually wants to do that and learn to code, which I love that advice, do you have any resources, places that you point people to for learning to code, getting started down that path?

Marily Nika (26:31):
It depends on what type of learner you are. There are some people that learn offline, so just go to Coursera, there are so many courses. There is an amazing one actually introduction to AI by Stanford that they're going to encourage people to take a look at. But I know that a lot of people don't like, don't have the time, don't have the discipline to actually take time off or after work, after they put their kids to sleep to just do it. So if you enjoy learning with others, if you enjoying being part of a team, if you enjoy going through a journey together, then I recommend these resources. So there is something called Career Foundry, which is a fantastic on coding school, General Assembly and then Coding Dojo.

(27:13):
I was actually give a talk, Ages of God Coding Dojo [inaudible 00:27:17] by Python, and all it takes is just a few weeks of your time and passion and just for you to roll up your sleeves and just realize that this is not intimidating and realize the benefits you can get by learning.

Lenny (27:31):
Awesome, thanks for sharing those. We'll include links in the show notes. Going back to a PM trying to become better in AI. If you think about a PM that's early in their career and wants to become a very strong AI PM. I know you have a whole course about this, which we can talk about now or later, whatever is easier, what should that PM be doing? We talked a bit about learn to code, maybe start playing with tools. What else do you suggest PMs that want to become really strong AI PMs do now and invest in?

Marily Nika (28:02):
So I do have a course that's coming up on February 6th on [inaudible 00:28:06], which is for current and aspiring product managers that want to build AI products. But I also have offline recordings. I have the same course on an offline basis on my website. I'd be happy to talk to you here, you already chat to me about this. What I feel people should understand is what it takes to manage an AI product. Of course people are very familiar with the stages of product development in general, but AI product development is different. As I mentioned before, sometimes you're actually managing the problem and not the product and you're trying to secure out if there is a problem that makes sense to be answered by a smart solution.

(28:45):
So it's a very interesting and more complicated process than regular product management. So number one, figure out how it differs from general product management. Number two, if you're already at the company that is actually having AR researchers and AI research scientists, I encourage people to just maybe talk to them and shadow them and spend an hour of their week just talking to them and experiencing what they're doing. This is going to open your mind, this is going to give you so much context as to what it is and the endless potential that you can identify there.

Lenny (29:22):
Awesome. And is there anything else you want to share from your course that you think might be interesting to folks?

Marily Nika (29:30):
So we talked about why it's awesome to be an AI PM, but I do want to call out that there are a few challenges that people need to be aware of. Number one, and I kind of mentioned it before, is the uncertainty. You may have been working on all of these incredible research and ideas in hypothesis, but then when you actually train the model, the results you may be getting may not be optimal, may not be answering the questions or the hypothesis that you actually had in mind. So that's number one. You need to be able to encourage the teams throughout this process because you're like the captain of the ship, you need to be the one that's cheerleading the team, making sure everyone keeps going.

(30:10):
Number two, you are going to have to [inaudible 00:30:15]. You are going to have to change the action in managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky and it can be challenging.

(30:22):
Number three, we talked about data, but getting good data is hard. You may need to be creative, figure out ways for data collection that you never thought you'll do. You may get on the street and ask for people to actually contribute data for what it is you're doing. You need to be able to and willing to do everything. And the last thing is from a career trajectory, usually product managers get ahead the more they launch. But if you're in a research or if you're not going to launch as often, so you need to make sure to clarify with the hiring managers early on, "Hey, what does progress mean? How am I going to get a sense in a research work which is different than what I've been doing so far." So it's challenging but I always encourage people to flex different muscles and this is the zero to one muscle. The other thing is this crucial when it comes to product management.

Lenny (31:15):
This actually is a great segue to a question I definitely wanted to ask, which is around getting buy-in for investment at a company for ML. So there's sometimes all this energy for a zero to one, let's just try something, sometimes not, so maybe there's a two part question here. Do you have any advice on just getting buy-in for we want to try something with ML. It's going to take us six months to figure out if it's worth the effort, but we think there's something here. And then sometimes there's a lot of energy initially and then you get some win, like your search ranking's smarter and it's great.

(31:48):
But then maintaining that, having all these really expensive people working and just tweaking this model and continuing to make it smarter and a little more efficient, often it's hard to continue to get buy-in for that sort of team. Do you have any advice on initial buy-in, let's try something here, and then down the road just keeping a team going, trying to make this thing smarter and smarter.

Marily Nika (32:09):
People should know that there is an excellent source of inspiration and something that could kind of de-risk things, which is adjacent products. Maybe the company has already launched the product that has been successful, those AI firsts. And whenever I try to convince leadership about something that I want to do that's a big bet, I always use examples and I'm like, "Hey, this seemed crazy at the time, here's how they work. What I'm proposing is very similar to this crazy thing. And then I propose a little contingency plan, like hey, if that doesn't work out, here's the rollback plan, here's the maximum impact it will have done in a negative way, which is not going to be too much. And you kind of take it all on [inaudible 00:32:55].

(32:55):
And it's interesting because the more you work on this specific company, the more trust you get. And if the culture is such, then failing is going to be welcome. So a lot companies that welcome pain because you can just go ahead and do this sort of thing.

Lenny (33:09):
Do tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most investments in ML are not successes and often not great uses of time. I'm curious if that changes with more tooling and more public models that people can plug into without having to build their own. I wonder if it becomes like, "Oh okay look we're put in three weeks, we'll get something really useful."

Marily Nika (33:27):
Exactly. And also the other thing, and I wanted to add on the question you asked before about hey how do you keep updated about new niche tech? We shouldn't underestimate academia and research blogs and there's a website called Archive where you can see new papers come up, because this is where... ChatGPT and [inaudible 00:33:49] used to be there for a long time, there was a lot of information on this sort thing. But it's now recent where we see that research scientists and research orgs are not as siloed as they used to be. So the more companies invest on staffing, this layer between productionizing and research, academic research, the more PMs you're going to add there, then the more you're going to see this bridge creating goods, products, [inaudible 00:34:20]. So sometimes you have amazing ideas by research scientists but you need a PM to take it and actually figure out ways to also monetize it.

(34:28):
That's the other thing, if you're a PM you need to come up with ways to actually be able to monetize and ChatGPT is now free for everyone. But I don't know if you saw, there was a signup forum that was coming around saying, "Hey, would you pay for this? What would be the minimum you pay? What would the maximum you pay? What would you like to see if you paid?" So having PMs breached the tap is crucial for companies to be able to take the research and actually come up with meaningful use cases for users.

Lenny (34:56):
I think they actually started charging the other day. I think it's like $40, $42 a month to start using it. I think people have been talking about on Twitter, I don't know if that's live yet. And then you talked about research papers, when I think that, I always think of Tyler Cohen, he has this awesome blog marginal revolution and he is really good at sharing insights from research papers that he's reading. So that's another place for folks to check out. He's just this really smart dude. He's really excited about AI and GPT in general and so he shares a lot of really interesting insights about it all. Segueing a little bit to your course, I have a couple questions about it. One is can you just talk about the broad framework of your course? How long is it, what do you learn, what are the workshops broadly? And then I have a couple follow up questions.

Marily Nika (35:39):
My course is three week long. It's meant for people that are either aspiring or current PMs that want to understand how to sprinkle in AI solutions or they wanted a full-time AI course. Week one is more about introduction, what the product development lifecycle is for regular products and how it differs for AIPN specifically. And then we talk about idea creation. How on earth do you come up with ideas? And I love what Steve Job said where he used to say, "Well, users don't know what they want until you show it to them." And that's exactly the mindset I want to invite two people and say, "Hey, people don't know how on earth you use AI." People will never have imagined ChatGPT can be what it is.

(36:26):
And then we take that and we dive deep and we talk about how on the earth do you productionize something like this? What are the different partners you're working with? What is a research scientist and how on the earth do you collaborate and how do you partner with them? How do you convince them what you have in mind for their precious research to be converted into a product? How on earth do you convince them to trust you and how do you influence them? And then at the end we're talking about how you actually will be able to pave your pathway PM all the way from interviewing for this role, from what resumes look like, and doing some mock interviews because the more you practice the better it is.

Lenny (37:03):
How many workshops are there through the course?

Marily Nika (37:05):
Nine workshops.

Lenny (37:06):
Nine workshops. Of the nine workshops, which of them are you finding is the most exciting, game-changing for someone, most interesting?

Marily Nika (37:15):
So throughout the duration of all these workshops, people have homework and they actually take home an exercise where they need to create and develop their own AI product end to end, and they can pair up with each other. By the way, there was this two students pair up and actually where I would raise funding, which is mind blowing to me, which is really great.

Lenny (37:15):
That's awesome.

Marily Nika (37:35):
But to continue, the most exciting part is when everyone at the great end are actually presenting their work and they're actually asking questions and getting feedback and they're just really excited and proud for what they created.

Lenny (37:48):
That's a good reminder of a lot of the learning that you do is just doing it, not just reading about it and following Twitter. Can you share any examples of stuff people built after the course?

Marily Nika (37:57):
Someone was able to actually, and I kid you not, create a little model that was able to take us an input x-rays that they found online and was able to tell us what was wrong if something was wrong with that patient. And it's just crazy to think that you can do that within three weeks. Obviously it was just by photos we were able to crawl online for x-rays. But the concept is there that you can build something like that, you can create it. And to take it a bit further, they wanted to create a lower recommender system and say, "Hey, we think this is what's wrong with you, here are the steps you should follow." Obviously we're not trying to play doctors or to pretend that or medical in any way, but being able to see that actually functioning is just, it's very impactful.

Lenny (38:48):
That's amazing. Do they already know how to code, do this team that built this thing?

Marily Nika (38:51):
They did not, but part of the course is to teach people the basics that you are going to need, prove it PM lens. And there are some no click tools as I mentioned that are going to allow you to drive and drop and train these models and input photos in it and be able to do it.

Lenny (39:07):
Can you mention those tools again because that is really interesting and it's just like a peek at your course, but if someone wanted to start building something like this, what are some of these tools they could check out?

Marily Nika (39:16):
One of the tools I would like to recommend to people is actually Auto ML. This is offered by World of Cloud and essentially it allows you to train high quality custom machine learning models, which minimal effort, you don't need to be able to code anything like that. You need to have a lot of photos and images that you have already corrected but it's not going to do the collection for you. And a great application I had to seen, there is actually a YouTube video about this. There was this company that actually had a lot of winter banks and what they did is in order to maintain these, they will actually have people manually have huge ladders and go take a look and see if everything was okay. So eventually they just [inaudible 00:39:59] drones and they had these drones fly on all of these machines and take photos of everything. And then they downloaded all these photos and they uploaded on Auto ML and they were able to see which ones needed maintenance and which did not.

(40:12):
And I think they reduced time from three weeks of work to a few hours of knowing which needed maintenance and just be able to send people there. So it's this type of thing that you can do on your own by applying this sort of tools.

Lenny (40:25):
Saying that tool is called Auto ML?

Marily Nika (40:28):
Yes, Auto ML.

Lenny (40:28):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Coming back to your course and maybe just a couple more questions. Can you just talk about what it takes to build a course like the course you built, how much time did it take you? How much work did it take? Anything that you want to share.

Marily Nika (40:43):
It treated creating like course like a product. This is what I did is, I came up with some hypothesis as to who the audience was and as to what they were looking to get out of it. And I started reaching out to people and I started saying, "Hey, first of all, would you like to learn from me? Second of all, what would you like to learn? What are the specific questions that you would need answered?" Because these are people that are working, people [inaudible 00:41:09] that have families. In order to take a break from all that you need to provide something to them that is meaningful. And there were quite a few activations. In the beginning I was focusing the course more for software engineers that wanted to become AI product managers. But then I realized, no, there are a lot of PMs that want to become AI product managers.

(41:31):
So I did a little online shift there. So what it takes is make sure you find the right audience, make sure to figure out what that audience wants, make sure to have the right duration. One week I find it too short. Two weeks, it'll still be rushed. Three weeks is excellent because you give the opportunity to everyone to present and to keep to know each other on an offline discord community, which is another important part. And then the last thing, you need to have a personal relationship with everyone. So I've messaged everyone, I've seen everyone's application. I met with some people as well just to make sure to answer any questions and concerns because I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable just trusting a stranger like me and paying them to provide knowledge for their course. So it took quite a few iterations, but I was able to get there and now I'm very, very happy about it and I recorded it offline as well for people.

Lenny (42:27):
Has anything had to change in this course? Maybe it's just as the last question, things are moving so fast. Is there anything you've had to rethink, redo since you first built it?

Marily Nika (42:35):
I actually added bonus sections and one bonus section was [inaudible 00:42:38] and how it was trained. This is because I started this new cohort in December and on day one the question I got is, what is this? How did it start? What is going on? How did they train it? So I added the dedicated section for it and I point people to it.

Lenny (42:52):
Amazing. Anything else that you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Marily Nika (42:58):
It was someone that recommended, I actually did a course and in the beginning I laughed and I said, "Wait, people would want to learn from me. Really?" And of course they did. And I'm teaching so many people. So what I want to tell people is don't underestimate this. Try creating your own courses as well. People may want to learn what you take for granted. For them it may be game changing, it can be life changing. So building courses is an amazing thing and we're living in the full [inaudible 00:43:30]. So the course is content, so go try this.

Lenny (43:33):
I find that teaching and at least crystallizing thoughts is one of the best ways to learn it yourself. I imagine you learned a lot about AI much more than even came into it with just putting it together into a course.

Marily Nika (43:44):
Absolutely. And I got some uncomfortable questions that I had no idea how to tackle. People on day one were like, how do I assess the tradeoffs between these two different months? And I had to figure out how to answer these things and how to incorporate them in my course. So learning from the students, learning from the course, learning from explaining is just so viable. So skills that we can get.

Lenny (44:07):
Well with that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, share. We'll see how it all goes. Sound good?

Marily Nika (44:18):
Sounds good.

Lenny (44:19):
Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.

Marily Nika (44:22):
Inspired. It's all about how to create tech products people love.

Lenny (44:28):
Marty Kagan, right?

Marily Nika (44:29):
Yes, that's the one. Great.

Lenny (44:34):
Cool. Anything else? Or that's the one that comes to mind.

Marily Nika (44:35):
You Look Like a Thing and I Love You and I have it right here. It's a great thing, super, super cool. It's about how AI works and why it's making the world a weirder place. It's actually a very fun book. And there's one more, which is a book, a workbook I originally launched with Alana Karen and it's a workbook for women in tech trying to navigate working in tech. It's called Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook. So that's another thing that they want to shamelessly plug in.

Lenny (45:02):
Ah, that's a great choice to plug. Where can folks find that? Is that on Amazon?

Marily Nika (45:06):
Yeah, Amazon.

Lenny (45:07):
Amazing. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?

Marily Nika (45:11):
I like Boz's podcast. I don't know if you're aware of it. Boz is the CEO of Facebook. He has a great podcast.

Lenny (45:19):
I have not heard it. I do know of Boz. I'll check that out. I didn't know he had a podcast. He had some great writing over the years. Maybe that's why he doesn't write it anymore. He has his podcast. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Marily Nika (45:30):
Oh my God, The White Lotus. People were talking about this thing. I ended up just trying it out and me and my husband, we just binge watched the whole thing. Is just so different, so mind blowing, get you excited about going to Hawaii again. It's just really good.

Lenny (45:45):
Have you seen the second season?

Marily Nika (45:46):
I've seen it and it's so much better than the first, which is rare.

Lenny (45:50):
I agree. Awesome. Love that show. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask, and bonus point if it's AI related.

Marily Nika (45:57):
I love to ask people, how would you explain a database to a three year old? And I know it's kind of an AI, not everyone say ai, but I love asking it because people are thinking the [inaudible 00:46:11], like what did you just ask me? But it's so important to be able to explain things in a simple ring and have the storytelling to convince a kid and really explain technical terms to non-technical people.

Lenny (46:23):
Favorite AI based tool that you think people should check out.

Marily Nika (46:27):
Talk about ChatGPT, now I have this on ChatGPT, this is what comes to mind. Well, the Lensa app was pretty cool too, right? We all plugged in our [inaudible 00:46:36] and we're able to see what they would look like as fantastic heroes. I have to say, I tried being the mail version because it was so much cooler than the KingL version, so that's when I recommend to people, try the mail version.

Lenny (46:48):
That's fun. And they actually have pets now. That's what got me the download and pay for it. You can take pictures of your pets and they look so fun. That's like a killer feature right there. Good job Lensa. And the app is Lensa, right?

Marily Nika (47:01):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:47:02]

Lenny (47:02):
Amazing. Marily, thank you so much for spending time with me, sharing your wisdom. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Marily Nika (47:12):
Thank you so much. People can find me on Instagram. I also have a product channel on YouTube that you can check out. I just started it. I'm getting used to the whole process. I'm also kicking off a newsletter, just any social reach out and you'll see all my links.

Lenny (47:28):
How do they find the YouTube channel? How do they find the newsletter?

Marily Nika (47:31):
Typing Marily Nika.

Lenny (47:32):
Marily, thank you again for being here.

# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real time feed. Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

# How to speak more confidently and persuasively | Matt Abrahams (professor, speaker, author)

## Transcript

Matt Abrahams (00:00:00):
Visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
Most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk.

Matt Abrahams (00:00:20):
You actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:00:34):
Strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Matt Abrahams. Matt is a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business where he teaches a very popular class on communication and public speaking. He's also the host of the incredibly popular podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart; and the author of the very popular book, Think Faster and Talk Smarter. Matt also coaches people one-on-one on public speaking and communication skills. And in our conversation we focus on the two areas that people most need help with. One, reducing their anxiety before and during any form of public speaking, and getting better at speaking on the spot, including giving better toasts, giving feedback, doing Q&A, and even apologizing.

(00:01:36):
Like we talk about in the actual conversation, speaking well is a superpower in your career for interviewing, for being great in meetings, for pitching your manager on ideas, to leading teams. And the skill becomes even more important as you grow in your career. The good news is that you can get better at it with a bit of help. I've worked on this a lot over the course of my career and I still get really nervous before big talks and even before every podcast episode, but many of these techniques I actually put into practice and I share that in our conversation. If you pick just a couple things from this episode to put into practice, you'll become a better communicator, you'll be less nervous, and you'll get better at dealing with on-the-spot moments.

(00:04:50):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:04:54):
Lenny, I am excited for our conversation and thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
Thank you for being here. I'm even more excited for the conversation. So what I want to do with our time today is there's two areas I want to focus. One is talking about techniques to help people manage anxiety when public speaking. And two is helping people get better at speaking on the spot, which you wrote a whole book about. And if you think about it, I think that's like most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk. It's usually like you said, Q&A or a or toast someone wants to give you or ask for feedback or things like that. So I'm excited to dig into those things. How do that sound broadly?

Matt Abrahams (00:05:33):
Absolutely, I look forward to that and those are topics I'm very excited to talk about, have done a lot of research in and look forward to sharing more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I suspected as much. Okay, so let's talk about anxiety. You have a bunch of really novel techniques in your book and your podcast for calming your body down, calming your mind down when you're planning to give a talk, when you're actually about to give a talk, when you're giving a talk. And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end. How's that?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:15):
That sounds great. That sounds great. I love that you've applied some of these techniques and found value from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:19):
I'll talk about this, I'll talk about this. Okay, first of all, just to catch on this, you're not a fan of the picture people in your audience naked approach, correct?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:27):
The Brady Bunch advice is not good advice. I don't know about you and I don't know anybody who could imagine seeing a bunch of people in their underwear and feel more comfortable with that. And I think if you do, there are other issues you need to be dealing with than beyond speaking anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:42):
Yeah, it feels like highly inappropriate now, just that idea, trying to picture everyone-

Matt Abrahams (00:06:46):
No, but underlying that if you'll give me a moment, there is some value. This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
Well, let's actually talk about this one while we're on it because I think this is a really powerful technique. An idea just to kind of summarize, you picture ahead of time, what it's going to look like and feel like. You talking, looking at the audience. You talk about that and just how to go about using that technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:07:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And this is some of the oldest research on public speaking anxiety. It was research done in the '80s from the University of Oregon. So visualization, what it does is it allows you to see the event in a way that you have much more control over it so you can think about it. So a good visualization involves some deep breathing to calm yourself. Either you close your eyes or you just look at a picture. Maybe you can get a picture of the environment you're speaking in. I often recommend speakers see the room even if they're not physically present, but get a picture online or some way envision yourself in the room, envision yourself in the room with the people you'll be speaking to. Often we know the individuals or some of them. We can also go online and figure out who they are.

(00:08:39):
So visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking but getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. And by taking yourself through that you in essence are a dress rehearsal even though you're not physically in the room. And there's good research to say that this desensitizes people. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time where they'll do visualization to help them and it really does work. And like I said, there are virtual tools now that can help you do this where you can actually program it to have a certain size audience. You can even program some of these to have a responsive audience or a distracted audience. All of this in service of just preparing you for what you're really going to see.

(00:09:25):
And the bottom line is this, what you're doing for yourself is making sure it's not new and novel. It's something been there, done that, even though if it was virtual or visualized in your mind, to help you feel better about the circumstance. It gives you a sense of agency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
I've done this myself actually. I gave a TEDx talk once and it was probably the scariest talk I've ever given and I spent a lot of time doing this and it doesn't actually have to take that much time. It could be like a five-minute thing where you sit down, calm yourself, and then just picture the stuff. And ideally you do it a couple times, I imagine.

Matt Abrahams (00:09:57):
That's right. Good for you. And congratulations on giving a TEDx talk. That is a high-stakes talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
Thank you. That was before TEDx became super uncool. It was still pretty early. It's out there in the internet in case people want to find it.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:09):
Don't say they're uncool. I'm doing one in two weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:11):
They're so cool. That is, they are cool.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:13):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
They're incredible. I'm impressed.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:17):
I've done a number of them and I've coached many people and I think that there's a lot of value that they can provide people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
There is. There is. I think they've just become slightly less cool because now there's a lot of them, but they're still incredibly cool, I'm very proud.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:29):
Okay, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
So on the visualization piece, I think we have a lot of techniques, but just on this one, part of it is continue to calm yourself as you're doing it. I think that's really important because you want to help your body not connect to the stress that you're feeling like you're going to experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:46):
That's correct. Any distance you can give yourself from the anxiety that you're feeling is helpful and there are lots of techniques that help give you a little bit of distance and visualization is one of those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:57):
One of my favorite techniques that it might be in this bucket, it might be on the spot advice bucket, but I think it works great here is what you call dare to be dull. Can you talk about that because I love that?

Matt Abrahams (00:11:09):
Yeah. I really leaned into this with the spontaneous speaking work that I've been doing as of late, but it applies to anybody speaking. This is a notion that comes from the world of improvisation and when people hear improv, they often think of standup comedy, having to be funny. And that's not what improv is all about. Improv is all about being present, being collaborative, being open, and it's a wonderful tool just to help you get present oriented. Think of it as like meditation in action, but also it teaches lots of valuable skills for communication.

(00:11:42):
When we communicate, especially spontaneously, we want to do it really well. We want to answer the question with the best answer, we want to give the right feedback, we want to be the most interesting in small talk and that puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. And you can think of it this way, it's really taxing our cognitive bandwidth.

(00:12:04):
Your brain in many ways is like a CPU, a computer. It's not a perfect analogy, but it works. And if I am constantly judging and evaluating everything I am saying against some standard of perfection, whatever that is, it means I have a limited amount of bandwidth to focus on what I'm actually saying and connecting to my audience. If you have a laptop or a phone that has lots of windows and apps open, each one of those is performing less well because of the other ones being open. So I often say strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just get the task done, just answer the question, just give the feedback, just be engaged in the small talk. And by doing that you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed. So dare to be dull is all about giving yourself permission to just be present and do what's needed. And when you do that you find that you actually do quite a good job at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
The last point I think is really important, you talk about this in your book. Is when you start with, "Okay, I'm just going to say something, it'll be fine." Without that pressure, you end up saying something better and more interesting and more insightful because you're less nervous about it.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:16):
That's exactly right. We are often our biggest impediments to good communication because of the anxiety we bring to the party.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
That's awesome. And I think this can apply to prepared talks too. When you're preparing a deck, don't put this pressure on yourself, "This has to be the best talk ever." Just like, "I'm going to do my best. Let me just start with something that's good enough." People learn something and then from that, their editing ends up leading to something great in my experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:39):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):
Awesome. Okay, let's go to the next technique, and this is another one I've practiced and another guest on the podcast actually suggested this and these two remind me of using this one, which is to tell yourself when you're going to be giving a talk. "I'm excited. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to give this talk." And reframe it from, "I'm nervous," to like, "No, I'm excited. This is going to be amazing." Can you talk about that technique?

Matt Abrahams (00:14:04):
Absolutely. So this is one of many cognitive reframing techniques. It is often attributed to my friend and colleague, Alison Wood Brooks, she's at Harvard Business School who did some research into this. And what she found is...

(00:14:18):
Well, first take a step back. When you get physically aroused by anxiety, you're under that fight or flight threat response. It turns out that same response happens to your body when you're excited. The human body has pretty much just one arousal response. Our heart beats faster, we breathe more shallow, we get a little shaky, but the big difference is how we label that. So if I say, "Hey Lenny, guess what? Your colleague couldn't show up today and you need to go teach the class or you need to go give that presentation." You might feel your heart rate go up, get a little shaky, sweat on your brow and you're seeing that as negative. But if I said, "Hey Lenny, guess what? You just won the lottery." Same physiological response would happen, but you would see that likely as more positive.

(00:15:06):
So how we label the arousal matters and what Alison's research and others have followed up with suggests is that when we feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, "This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value." And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax. And her research fascinatingly found that people actually were perceived as communicating better. And again that's because that pressure was taken off of them. So I challenge everybody to think about what are the exciting elements of the communication opportunities you have and really lean into those. And when you feel those anxiety symptoms, remind yourself these are signs of excitement. This is me being excited about sharing this information and it can really help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
This is another one I've done and it super works. It sounds so trivial and so like, "Why would this do anything?" But I find you just say that just like, "I'm going to have so much fun. This is going to be exciting." It does make an impact. So another one to try, even though it sounds really trivial.

(00:16:12):
Kind of along these lines, there's another technique you recommend which is a mantra, having a mantra that you repeat to yourself. I don't know if it's kind of the same general idea, but you have a couple mantras that you recommend to people like "I have value to add" and things like that. What advice do you have there?

Matt Abrahams (00:16:27):
Yes, thank you. And that's mine. The one that you shared is, "I have value to add." So if we were to really listen to the voice in our heads when it comes to communication, we say a lot of negative things to ourselves. We say things like, "I'm not prepared. I'm not going to be as good as this person. I'm an imposter." We carry around with us a lot of this chatter that actually sets us up to not do well or to be more nervous. So if we can actually change that talk track, it can help us.

(00:17:01):
I'm not saying you have to go to an extreme and say, "I'm going to be the best communicator ever." Rather you can simply say as I do and as you alluded to. What I'll say right before I speak is, "I have value to bring."

(00:17:12):
Often when we are in communicative situations, especially at work, people want to hear from us. We've been invited to speak, we're on the agenda for the meeting. There is value people can take from our communication and we just have to remind ourselves of that. So having some little mantra that you can say that's not over the top but just makes sense. It could be as simple as you've got this, or I'm prepared, or I know my stuff. And I actually encourage people to write it on a post-it note if you're old school, sometimes people put it into their phones as a reminder. So like a minute or two minutes before they're set to give the presentation or participate in the meeting, it flashes up. We just have to turn off or turn down the noise of that internal negative self-talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
What are some other mantras that you found helpful or that people use?

Matt Abrahams (00:18:03):
They're very personal to different people. I was just coaching a senior leader the other day who his mantra was, "Last time this went well." He's a leader, he does a lot of the same presentations and just by saying last time this went well, reminds him that it's likely to go well this time. We are very susceptible to catastrophizing when we're very nervous about things, especially when we're exposed in front of people. Not in the Brady Bunch exposure we talked about earlier, but when we're out there speaking or communicating and simply reminding ourselves that often they go very well is helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
Yeah. There's another one that I think you shared which is, "It's not about me, it's about my content."

Matt Abrahams (00:18:41):
Yes, exactly. That's another one. That's a great one. It can be very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
The one you shared about, "I've got this," reminds me, my wife took a course with the Artist's Way writer, Julia Cameron I think is her name. And she has this piece of advice where you name your critic, your inner critic that's always telling you to stop doing stuff. You name him or her. So I name mine Jim. And then when he or she is giving you things you don't want to hear, you're just like, "Jim, I got this. Jim, I don't need this advice."

Matt Abrahams (00:19:11):
There is a lot of evidence on personifying the things that challenge us and then having conversations with it. It's a way of rationalizing some of the things that we do that are quite negative. So something there for sure to be thinking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:30):
There we go. Bonus advice. That was-

Matt Abrahams (00:19:32):
Bonus advice, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I didn't expect that.

Matt Abrahams (00:19:34):
And the cool thing that what you're highlighting is there is a lot of advice out there on how to manage anxiety. Many of us feel like we're the only people who feel this nervous because we see our colleagues, our friends or Ted talks as you were talking about, and we see these people communicating just so effortlessly. Often a lot of work went into that and we don't see that work. And sometimes just knowing that others experience it makes us feel better.

(00:19:58):
If you'll allow me, I'll tell this very quick story. I was in the San Francisco Airport, this was several years ago after my Speaking Up Without Freaking Out book came out, and my name was called over the PA system at the airport counter. The seat that I was supposed to sit in was broken and they wanted to talk to me about it. So when I came away from that, somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, you're the guy that wrote that book on speaking anxiety." I said, "Yes." And I said, "What do you know about it?" He goes, "Oh, I bought the book." I said, "Oh, was it helpful?" He says, "Incredibly helpful, but I didn't read it." I'm like, "This is weird. So you're telling me the book was helpful and you didn't read it?" And so I said, "Tell me more." And he said, "Just knowing that a book like that existed made me feel better because I don't know you and I know you certainly didn't write the book for me. So it implies that lots of people have this issue."

(00:20:44):
And just by normalizing the anxiety, which by the way is the normal condition. Those of us who study this believe it is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others. So sometimes just reminding yourself that you're not alone and that others have it can actually help reduce the pressure that we feel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
This is such an important point that I am kicking myself for not starting with this also because I think this is something people don't realize. They see all their execs at their company speaking incredibly well, so confidently, so articulately and just like, "Oh my God, how will I ever be someone like that?" Is there anything more you can share of just like you have tons of students that go through your class, you see these issues, they're more transparent, you think about their challenges, I imagine. Is there anything more you could share there to help people feel better? Like this is most people, even when you see someone amazing at speaking, they are also probably nervous.

Matt Abrahams (00:21:36):
With regard to that, I think we just need to talk about it more. We need to share about it. I mean, I always will share that I still have anxiety in speaking in certain situations and it's something that's taken me a long time to work on. I also help people understand that it's not a light switch. It's not like you either have it or you don't. It's a process. And so the idea is over time, we will feel less nervous if we apply some of these principles you and I are talking about.

(00:22:01):
A great technique to help people that often isn't talked about is many of us feel much more comfortable in conversation than we do in presenting. And conversation is a back and forth. So you can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. And you don't even have to have a conversation with the audience. You can simply have it with yourself. For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." And you state the question and then you answer it. I am actually having a conversation with myself in that moment where I am asking myself a question. I happen to know the answer, I give the answer. This again, just like the reframing as excitement versus anxiety, this is a reframe. I'm not presenting, I'm having a conversation. And in so doing it ratchets down that anxiety.

(00:22:53):
So we need to talk about it. We need to share our experiences with developing anxiety management plans. We realize it's not binary, it's not I have it or I don't. And we start seeing where we feel more comfortable and how can we bring that comfort level into the types of situations that make us nervous, like simply having a conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:13):
You have another technique I think that's different, maybe it's exactly the same, which is to ask a question of somebody else as you're talking, which is I think deflects attention from you. Can you talk about that?

Matt Abrahams (00:23:22):
Yeah. So we talked about the way we desensitize through visualization. The other thing we can do is distract.

(00:23:30):
I coached a very senior leader at Google who got very nervous when he was up in front of people, and what we did is we distract his audience. So he would start every single presentation saying these words, "Good morning, let's watch this video." And he'd show a 30-second video that was on topic about something they were going to talk about in the meeting. And when the video stopped, he would then facilitate a discussion of what that video was about and then he would ease into his content. So he went from being a presenter to being a facilitator or somebody who was having a conversation with the audience. That made him feel so much better.

(00:24:05):
And so all of us can do things that can distract our audience. Now when I say distract, I don't mean take them on a tangent that's not relevant to what you're saying, but maybe you ask them a question, maybe you tell them a story, maybe you show them a video or ask them to read something. So there are lots of things that you can do that will help get the attention off you for just a little bit so that you can then focus on what works for you or take that deep breath that'll help calm you down. All of these are very useful techniques.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:35):
Yeah, it's interesting once you start talking, it's okay usually. It's the beginning part that you need [inaudible 00:24:40].

Matt Abrahams (00:24:40):
Yeah, most people are most nervous one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking. And if you can find ways to get yourself through that, then it becomes much easier for most people. There are some people who that's not true for, but for most people that's the way it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
Awesome. Okay, next technique that actually another guest mentioned, and we spent a bunch of time on this, a guest named Johnny Miller, which is a breathing technique. And just to give a little context from what he taught us is that 80% of our neurons go from our body to our brain versus 20% is our brain telling our body what to feel. And so this research shows that what our body's feeling is what our brain's going to think. So if our body's acting nervous, we're going to think, oh, we're nervous. And if you change the state of your body, your mind feels different.

Matt Abrahams (00:25:23):
I love this stuff. This research, embodied cognition is what it's called, is fascinating to me. I'll share one of my most favorite studies in this. There was a researcher at Duke, I think it was Duke, who... The only experimental variation that he did is he had people hold something that was cold in their hand, like an iced coffee versus a warm coffee. And then he asked the participants to make ratings of people. And if you were holding something cold, you saw the person as a colder person, as more aloof and more distant, and if you were holding something warm, you saw them as more collaborative and embracing. I find this stuff fascinating. What our body feels, our minds think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Awesome. So along those lines, there's a technique that you recommend that he recommended, but I think it's a great reminder of the double exhale where you breathe in and then you exhale twice as long. Can you talk about that and tell people about it?

Matt Abrahams (00:26:13):
Yeah. Breathing is very helpful in managing so many of our anxiety symptoms. It slows down the heart rate, makes our voice sound more normal because when we get nervous, we breathe shallow and that changes... Our voice is a wind instrument, it changes the way we sound, can reduce some of the shakiness. So deep belly breathing, the kind you do if you've ever done yoga or tai chi, qigong, really important to do and there are a whole bunch of variations on it. The one you're talking about is the double inhalation where you're taking an inhale in until you feel completely full and then you sneak in a little extra air and then you take a long exhale. People call it box breathing and other types of breathing.

(00:26:54):
The bottom line is this, what's critical to the relaxation response is the exhale. Lots of ways to inhale, lots of ways to exhale. You want your exhale to be longer than the inhale. The magic of the relaxation happens during the exhale. So I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out. And it is that way that you will feel... Not only will your body physiologically feel less stress, you'll be more focused in a present moment and not catastrophizing about all the things that might happen in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):
Great. Yeah, so it's like another example of this sounds so trivial and why would breathing differently do have any impact on my nervousness? But one, there's all this research that shows that it does, and two, if you try it, and this is another one I use, is it actually works very quickly and you do it a few times and like, wow, I feel really different.

Matt Abrahams (00:27:54):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:55):
It is interesting you put these together. From the way I've seen it, these are two different techniques, but I've never tried them together. One is... I think Huberman is big on this one. All his clips are always talking about this. One of you inhale fully and then you inhale a little bit more and there's some capillaries or something in your lungs that fill up that-

Matt Abrahams (00:28:12):
[inaudible 00:28:12]. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):
And then there's the 4, 4, 8 is the way this other guest shared is like breathe in four seconds, hold it four seconds, breathe out for eight seconds. But I'm going to try both. Wow. That's going to double up my calmness.

Matt Abrahams (00:28:27):
You'll be so mellow, nothing will bother you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:29):
So mellow. Okay. Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:28:39):
Well, so the first book had 50 techniques and not all 50 techniques work for everybody. One that I personally think is a lot of fun is getting present oriented because when I'm in the present, by definition I'm not worried about the future. And many of our anxiety comes from our fear of a potential negative future outcome like, "I'm not going to achieve my goal." So if I can do anything to be in the present moment, that helps me out a lot.

(00:29:02):
Something I do as part of my personal anxiety management plan is I say tongue twisters. Tongue twisters for me are a great way to get present oriented. You can't say it right if you don't say the tongue twister if you're not focused on the present moment. And it also warms up your voice. A lot of nervous speakers get so inside their head that they don't warm up their voice. And we all know if you've ever done any exercise or competed in any sports, you should warm up first. We have this mistaken notion that we can go from silence to brilliance without warming up. And I like saying tongue twisters out loud to get present oriented and to warm up my voice. So that's one that I often recommend. People think it's silly, but I have people who are like, that really works. It really helps me to get centered and to warm up. And so I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Well, let's share a couple of tongue twisters. What are some recommendations?

Matt Abrahams (00:29:50):
I will only share my tongue twister, I say Lenny, if you promise to say it after me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Absolutely. I'm so ready.

Matt Abrahams (00:29:55):
This is my favorite tongue twister. It takes five seconds to say, it's three phrases long. And if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. So I'm going to be listening as for all your listeners. So are you prepared? So it goes as follows, I slit a sheet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):
I slit a sheet.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:11):
A sheet I slit

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
A sheet I slit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:14):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:18):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:20):
Very good. You didn't say that naughty word. I'm sure you can imagine what it would've been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
A lot of danger, a lot of [inaudible 00:30:26].

Matt Abrahams (00:30:26):
A lot of danger. But in that moment you weren't thinking about, what's the next question I'm going to ask Matt? Or how much longer do we have in the podcast? No, you were simply focused on what we were saying and trying to say it without saying a naughty word. So that's that [inaudible 00:30:39]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:38):
And not have to censor this podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:42):
I've only had to bleep one guest in all my years of doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:46):
Okay, cool. We're going to link to that. Is there any other ones you want to share before we move on to getting better at speaking on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (00:30:52):
Well, the last one I'll say is, and this one is another one that falls in the kind of funny category, but there's research that says that when you swear, curse, it actually helps you reduce anxiety. When you curse, you release a flood of neurochemicals that blunt out the neurochemicals associated with anxiety, cortisol being a big one. So you get a big dopamine hit, for example, serotonin when you swear. So I'm not saying get up on stage and drop an F-bomb, but my students love this. I mean, it's like, "Matt's giving me permission to swear." And no, that's not what I'm doing, but it's an interesting technique that seems to help some people is to curse not necessarily in front of people, but that can help. And it also has an analgesic effect. It actually reduces pain as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
That's interesting. I could see during birth women screaming curse words.

Matt Abrahams (00:31:48):
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to say what I heard when my kids were born, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
But again, this could double up with the tongue twister where you just go for it and say-

Matt Abrahams (00:31:58):
Yeah, every tongue twister has to start with Nantucket and then we're good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):

(00:33:34):
Okay, let's shift to talking about talking on the spot.

Matt Abrahams (00:33:39):
I see you said shift very carefully. I appreciate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):
Now we're going to be so, so careful, I don't want this podcast flagged and for adults only. Okay, shift to a new topic. You have a whole book about how to get better speaking on the spot. And I think why this is important is again, what I said at the beginning that I think most of our "public speaking" is not planned public speaking. There's people asking for feedback in a meeting, people wanting you to give a toast, Q&A as we talked about. So what I want to do is you have advice for broadly getting better at these things and then you have advice for very specifically how to get better at giving better toast, doing better Q&A, getting better at small talk and things like that. So I want to start with the broad advice and then get into each of these. That sound good?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:27):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
How about you share your favorite techniques for broadly getting better at speaking on the spot, and then we'll see where that goes?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:37):
Sure. So the first thing in helping yourself feel better, speaking spontaneously, which is the vast majority of our communication, the plan presenting, the practiced pitch, the meeting with agenda pale in comparison to the times that we are spontaneously speaking. And the first thing that is important for everybody to know is we can all get better at it. That's the fundamental bottom line. Many of us feel like we're either born with the gift of gab or we're not. And so the first thing we have to realize is we can get better at it.

(00:35:08):
The second big point to make is you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but it is through preparation that we get better at it. And if you think about it, if you think about an athlete, when an athlete is doing their sport, they are being spontaneous, they are responding to the conditions that present themselves to them. What helps them do well is all the preparation and practice that they've done. So there are lots of analogs to this, but when we think about it in of communication, it seems foreign, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice. Those are the two big underlying principles to helping people get better.

(00:35:48):
The next level has to do with we have to attack both mindset and approach and the actual messaging itself. The only way I have found to help people get better at this is to look at how we approach it, our mindset, and then how we actually craft the messages through structure and focus that help us be better. So that's the gradual process from the broadest level about how we have to go about making this better for ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Maybe let's dig into the structure.

Matt Abrahams (00:36:17):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:17):
What is your advice for how to think about structuring if you're on the spot, like, "Oh, shit, how do I share something smart [inaudible 00:36:22]?"

Matt Abrahams (00:36:22):
See, the bad word came out, so you're ready for my tongue twister. So structure is critical. In spontaneous speaking, most of us, because we feel the intense pressure, the anxiety we just talked about, we just spew out information, we list and itemize information. We take our audience on the journey of our own discovery of what we want to say as we're saying it, and our brains are not wired for lists of information. In fact, Lenny, how many items do you need to buy from the grocery store before you actually have to physically write it down? For me it's four. Anything over four, I'm going to forget something. Our brains aren't wired for lists, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:03):
And so-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
I text myself.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:05):
Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, no, I'm old school. I actually put it on a piece of paper, but the point is that we're not wired that way. Our brains are actually wired for story, for connection, a logical connection of ideas. So it's about connecting those pieces together. So a structure is nothing more than a beginning, a middle, and an end. A package of information. The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it. That's a structure. It's a logical beginning, middle, and end. These items have a connection. So by finding a structure that you can rely on when put on the spot, it halves your burden.

(00:37:54):
When you're put on the spot, you have to think about what to say and how to say it. The structure tells you how to say it, and then you just have to think about what to put into it. So it's like having a recipe. If I have a recipe and I have good ingredients, I can cook a good meal. So there are lots of structures.

(00:38:10):
The whole second part of the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is specific structures for specific situations, introducing yourself, making an apology, giving feedback. And I'm not saying every time you give an apology or give feedback that you have to follow these structures. It just gives you a place to go when you're in that moment where you're like, "Where do I go? How do I start?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Cool. So we're going to talk about those examples. One of the structures that I liked that I wrote down is called prep, which is make your point, give a reason for making that point, give an example. And then what's the last one point again?

Matt Abrahams (00:38:47):
Yeah, restate your point. Review it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):
Restate your point. That feels like something that say in product teams can come up a lot is just like, here's what I think, here's why. Here's an example and then let me just remind you again what the point I'm making.

Matt Abrahams (00:38:57):
That's right. Yes. I love prep and the structure I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? And people on product teams I think could benefit so much from this. What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? It's the what of why you're speaking. The so what is why is this important and relevant to the people you're talking to or to your company or to prospective clients? And then the now what is what comes next. So on a product team, if you're describing a feature, here's what the feature is, here's why it's important, and here's what we're doing about it. If you're giving an update in an update meeting, a standup that you're having, here's what I'm working on, here's why it's important, here's what I'm doing next.

(00:39:41):
By packaging the information up in what, so what, now what, it becomes much more digestible, much more memorable. Just like prep. Prep works really well for a point you're making. What, so what, now what works really well for a broader presentation, update, feedback session that you're giving. So having a whole series of these tools in your toolkit can really make a difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
So we've talked about three structures so far. What, so what, now what; prep, which is make the point, give a reason example, and then restate the point; and then problem, solution benefit. So people listening to this it's like, "Oh, amazing, all these structures are great." Do you have any advice on how to remember these? You're like, "Oh, Matt, what do you think of this design?" Like, "Oh, shit, which one should I go with?"

Matt Abrahams (00:40:28):
I try to give each structure a catchy name. What, so what, now what rolls off the tongue. There's a structure in the book for giving feedback called 4Is for Apologizing AAA. So part of it is just coming up with a mnemonic that works for you and you can name them whatever you want, but really the way to get familiar with them and to have them at the ready is to use them.

(00:40:48):
When I coach people on what, so what, now what, I encourage them at the end of a podcast they listen to or something they read, take a moment and say, "What was it about? Why is it important to me and what can I do with that information?" And if you do that, not only do you get better and more comfortable deploying that structure, but you also remember the material better because there's a whole bunch of research that says when we interrogate the material that we listen to or read, we digest it and remember it more. So in 30 seconds you're really helping yourself at least in two ways by getting the structure down and remembering more. So you have to put it into practice.

(00:41:24):
The other way to do it in which we do a lot in my classroom is we have people dissect communication. So you listen to somebody or you see it and you say, what structure did they use? So it's about awareness building and then actually getting the reps. The only way you get better at communication, spontaneous or planned, is the way you get better at anything. Repetition, reflection, and feedback. You got to practice, you got to think about what worked or what didn't, and then you have to get feedback from others. We are not always the best judges of our communication. And in so doing, repetition, reflection and feedback takes your communication to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
That's a lot of work, Matt. That's a lot of work.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:02):
It is work. There is no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:04):
Got you.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:05):
But that's true with most things in life that are really important. There's no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's right. That's right. As people are thinking about this and listening to this, there's your course, obviously that you teach at Stanford and only Stanford students can take that. There's your book obviously. Is there anything else? If there's nothing, that's totally fine, that you point people to to actually practice these outside of the workplace? Are there courses that anyone can take that you recommend? Anything else you can point people to?

Matt Abrahams (00:42:31):
Absolutely. There are a lot of resources out there. One, I'm a huge proponent and a former member of Toastmasters. I think Toastmasters is a wonderful organization designed primarily to give you the reps. They do some teaching, but it's really to give you the reps. So I highly recommend Toastmasters.

(00:42:48):
Improvisation is another way to get comfortable with these skills. When people hear improv, they think, "Oh, I got to be funny and it's about performing," and it's not. Improv is really just about being more comfortable, being present, and really focusing on collaborating with others.

(00:43:04):
And then there are courses. You mentioned obviously that people have to be MBA students to take my MBA class, but Stanford and other institutions have continuing studies classes or extension classes that are open to the community. So I, every quarter teach a class that's open to anybody who registers all over the world. It's virtual. I have students this very quarter who take a class on a Monday night Pacific Time, 7:00 PM. I've got somebody in Egypt, I have somebody in China. So there are ways to take advantage of things happening at universities without being an enrolled student. So I would point people to all of those. And then clearly listening to podcasts, reading books, checking out blogs and videos can be really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:44):
I think to your point, it's like you can read about this and listen to podcasts all you want, but you're not going to actually get that much better. And with your course, I imagine there's practice you're doing as a part of the course.

Matt Abrahams (00:43:53):
Everything is applied. The only way to get better at communication is to do communication, to watch communication. And that's why in the books I write, I have this, try this. It's literally put the book down, go do this and then come back because that's how you learn communication. And so yes, any avenue to help you get the reps is going to be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I'll be honest, I did none of the try this. I'm just like, that's too much work. So I think that's why it's important to take something where you have to do it because it's too easy just like, yeah, yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:24):
Yeah. You're not the first person to say that they don't take the time to do that. There are others who say they really appreciate that. And for people such as yourself, at the very end of my book, I have a QR code that takes you to a bunch of videos. So if you don't want to do it yourself, you can actually watch people do it or watch me do it. And so that's at least better than not doing any of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
Awesome. I'll also give a shout-out to Toastmasters. I did Toastmasters for a while and two things there. One is there's a special focus on the spot speaking that's a part of the sequence.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:56):
They call them table topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Table topics, yeah. And that's like a 60-second, someone gets up and just has to talk on something. So it's a big part of that method. Also, I did it for a long time and all I did was I was the counter or the timer. You can do it without having to give any talks for as long as you want. And it's very cheap and they're everywhere. There's a local chapter wherever you are.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:17):
Absolutely. And many companies sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, so that's great. And they are very good at easing people into it. You're not forced to do anything. And the same is with improv. A good improv teacher never forces anybody to do anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
Great. We went way off-topic, but let's get back to the agenda at hand, which is let's talk about specific situations and advice you have for getting better at these. So maybe we start with small talk and there's one that I love and I find so important and so subtle, which is have comparable levels of disclosure. And the question basically is how do we get better at small talk? And here's one technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:55):
Yeah, so let me get to that point in a second because that's a more refined point than some general principles. When it comes to small talk, many people dread small talk, they feel really awkward about it. I think small talk has a bad reputation, needs to be rebranded. I think a lot of big things happen in small talk. We learn about ourselves and others. We form and foster relationships. I challenge everybody listening to think about some of their friends, our closest friends. How did you meet them? Probably some component of small talk played a role, especially early in those relationships. So it does good things for us.

(00:46:32):
The best advice I have ever heard for small talk came from a guest on my podcast. Her name's Rachel Greenwald. She's an interesting person. She's an academic and a matchmaker, really fascinating. And her advice was this: Be interested, not interesting. Many of us go into small talk thinking we have to be super interesting. We have to spike the ball over the net every time. When in fact small talk is more like playing the game of Hacky Sack, where it's simply just set the other person up to be successful and get the ball back to you. So if we go in with that mindset, it makes it easier.

(00:47:06):
Now there's some rules that we can follow. One rule is the one that you shared that in small talk there should be a balance of disclosure or depth of disclosure over time. So if you're telling me about the first time your first pet died, and I'm telling you my favorite color is blue, there's a discrepancy in disclosure there. Clearly you've revealed a lot more than I have. And we have this notion of reciprocity that if you share something that is appropriate but is more disclosive, that I should at some point match that level or come close. And if we don't, then it feels very awkward and we feel like we're not jiving in that way.

(00:47:49):
I don't want everybody sitting with a little card that they're checking off, but having that general notion in mind can help. And the trick here is not to be too disclosive too quickly. So if we start small talk and we're talking about the I meeting that we're at, and you immediately jump into the fight you had with your significant other that might lead to divorce, that's a deep and big step that might feel a little inappropriate. But over time, if we continue to disclose, it might be perfectly natural for you to share that. So there's sort of expectations and we just have to be mindful of those.

(00:48:24):
Another thing we need to be mindful of that I think is really important is this distinction between shifting and supporting responses. In a conversation, I can be supportive. That is, you might say, "Hey Matt, I just got back from Costa Rica." I could say, "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?" Those are supporting responses. I'm asking you to keep telling me more. A shifting response would be like, "Oh, you went to Costa Rica. I went to Hawaii." And the goal in a good conversation is to have more supporting responses than shifting, but to have some shifting responses. Because if all I do is continually support you, it looks like I don't want to share. I'm not being disclosive at all. So there are these subtle things that we can be aware of to help the conversation go and to breed that intimacy and immediacy that we feel, but it takes a congruence, a balancing of doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
This is awesome. I feel like everyone needs this class to just like, how do I talk to people? What's the right way to talk?

Matt Abrahams (00:49:24):
Well, right. The point that you're bringing up there, Lenny, is we're never taught this stuff and yet we have to do it all the time. And that's why focusing on it I think really matters. And it can really, as you said, superpower, it can be a superpower because so many people don't do this or spend the time getting better at it. We all operate under this notion of... the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. And that's not good for small talk and other communication situations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
I love this balance you just shared of... So the primary piece of advice for small talk is be interested, not interesting, ask person questions, get excited about what they're telling you. There's a classic book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is very much about this. Highly recommend it. It's like very old school now, but there's so much good advice there. There's no better sound to someone's ears than their name. So just saying their name, they're like, "Yeah, I love that." And then just smiling. There's all these very simple things that that book shares. It sounds like you recommend and you're fan of that book, and it's something you've read, right?

Matt Abrahams (00:50:27):
I know the book. Some of that stuff has been true for a long time. Some of the stuff. I'm not a big fan of ingratiation and manipulation. I like authenticity and some of the advice in books like that can sound like smile, nod your head. And all of that can sound a little manipulative and inauthentic, but I think some of those principles are important. And if you can in an authentic, true, appropriate way, leverage some of that, I think it would help you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:57):
Yeah, somebody once shared a story with their kid... Then they're 13. They read that book and it just effed them up for a while because they just started putting these into practice way too young.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:06):
Well, one thing... I mean, all of a sudden you're focusing on... You can get so wrapped up in doing these things that you're actually not connecting. It's like people who travel on a vacation and all they do is take pictures of where they are instead of experiencing where they are. And that's not where we want to be with this advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
But I love this other component of... Because a lot of people hear this advice, ask questions, be interested, be excited, this version of it, but you need to have somewhat equal levels of disclosure is really important. Because I fall into this sometimes where like, "I don't care about myself. I just want to ask you questions. And this is going great, I'm just going to keep asking." And if you're not sharing anything by yourself, it gets really strange. Even when they ask you, you're like, "No, no, let's keep talking about you." You think they want that, but they don't. They actually want to hear about you.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a lovely job as a podcast... I mean, so podcast host is a great job for you if you like asking questions, but I bet you have found, because I have found this for me as being a host of Think Fast, Talk Smart is that sharing a little bit about your own experience actually makes the conversations go better. And so I think that's a lesson for all of us, and you don't have to have your own podcast to learn that lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:16):
Yeah, I read this book on podcasting interviewing when I first started, and one of the big piece of advice is if you share more about yourself, you'll hear more stories that they can share. They're more vulnerable. Not that I think about that, but that's in my head sometimes.

Matt Abrahams (00:52:29):
Yeah. Well, you do a good job of it, even if it's just intuitive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Appreciate it.

(00:52:33):
Let's talk about another version of on-the-spot talking, which is giving feedback. Oftentimes people listening to this podcast, they're asked, what do you think of this design? What do you think of this roadmap? What do you think of the strategy? What are some tips for getting better at on-the-spot feedback?

Matt Abrahams (00:52:48):
First and foremost, we need to look at and define feedback. Feedback to me is an opportunity to problem solve. Certainly there are some behaviors that we absolutely have to shut down. It's inappropriate, it's inexcusable, we have to shut it down. But often feedback is really an opportunity to problem solve. And if you take it as an opportunity to problem solve, then what you're looking for is collaboration with the other person, which means that we have to invite them to join us as we do this. So it's not me bestowing upon you my opinion, it's me inviting you to together work on whatever this issue challenge is that we have. And I am a huge disciple of Kim Scott, Radical Candor. I really like her approach to it. Kim's a friend. She's actually a neighbor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Well, she's been on the podcast, by the way.

Matt Abrahams (00:53:35):
Oh, great. So you know Kim and your listeners know Kim. Yeah, she's great. Where I think I can add a little value to what Kim talks about, and she does talk about structure, but I think having the structure to package up the information to make it easier to digest by your audience, the person or people you're talking to, but also to formulate your thoughts can help. And we've already talked about one mechanism, one structure for feedback. It's what, so what, now what?

(00:53:59):
So imagine, Lenny, you and I come out of a meeting and you say, "Hey, Matt, how'd that go?" I could say, "I thought the meeting went really well, Lenny, except when you talked about the implementation plan. You spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." That's my what. "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." That's the so what. "Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." So that's the now what.

(00:54:32):
So that what, so what, now what helps me very quickly structure information and package it in a way that helps me as the giver of the feedback, think through what are the things I need to say? I need to think through what's bothering me, what the consequences are of that behavior, and then what I think you should do.

(00:54:51):
There's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is, and each I stands for something starting with the letter I. But four eyes also like glasses. It helps you see more clearly. So in the 4 I structure, the first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences.

(00:55:19):
So imagine I have an employee who doesn't show up to the meetings on time and prepared. I might say, "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." So information, impact, invitation, and implications. Now, certainly I can vary the tone and the directness of some of those responses so it sounds very differently, but thinking through it in my mind, I have to level set what we're talking about. I have to share why it's important to me at least, make the invitation, and talk about the benefits or consequences. Makes a lot of sense. So there are lots of structures and lots of ways to communicate, especially in feedback. Find one or two that work for you so when you're put on the spot, you can default to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
Maybe a big takeaway here is pick one of these structures that you want to use when somebody asks you for feedback. And the two you shared are what? So what? Now what? Or these four Is. Give information, show the impact that it had on you, invitation and then implications.

Matt Abrahams (00:56:30):
That's correct, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Okay. Let's talk about another category, which is not a work category, but I suck at toasts and I am always trying to get better at this. And you have a bunch of awesome advice for how to give better toasts. Can you share some stuff?

Matt Abrahams (00:56:45):
Yeah. We have all been victimized by bad toasts. The toast that goes on too long, the toast that's more about the person giving the toast than the event or the person. And when I say toast, I don't just mean at weddings, bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras. We give tributes at work all the time. Congratulations to the team or somebody's anniversary or somebody's retirement. So we give toasts and tributes all the time. In fact, I heard a statistic once that it is the most frequent public speaking event across people is giving toasts and tributes. So we should learn how to do these well.

(00:57:16):
So I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? Now, if I'm at a wedding, I don't have to tell the audience why we're here. We get it. But if we're doing an all hands and I'm called up to speak, it might be in my best interest to share with everybody, I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out. So you might have to say, why are we here?

(00:57:42):
The H is how are you connected to the event? So if I'm at a wedding, people might not know who I am. I could say, "Hey, I've known the groom for 25 years." And people are like, "Oh, okay. Now that makes sense." If you're giving a tribute at work, you don't have to say, "And I'm the boss." Everybody knows your position. So again, these are choices you make. So why are we here? How are you connected?

(00:58:02):
The A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. There's no insider knowledge and keep it concise.

(00:58:16):
And then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you. So express gratitude, express some kind of thanks. In a toast at a celebratory event, you might say cheers or whatever's appropriate for the culture you come from to signal closure. But again, why are we here? How are you connected? Anecdote or two, and then the gratitude or thanking at the end. And if you follow that structure, it can navigate, just like a GPS, your way through the toast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
This is such an easy structure to remember. There's so much of it that I love. What I want to understand is where do you put the actual content of the tribute and the toast? Is it the anecdote expands into, "Here's what I want to say?" Like there's an example or story and then it's like-

Matt Abrahams (00:58:59):
Exactly. So it is typically part of that. You might do it as part of the why we're all here. "We're here to really celebrate the Herculean effort of this particular team to get this product launched. I'm so honored to have supported it. I'm the manager of the team. Here's a story about how Lenny worked overtime to get this done. Let's raise our glasses and give them a salute." So yes, you could do it in the why are we here or through the anecdotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:29):
Okay. And then one of your other piece of advice, which connects to what you just said is be brief.

Matt Abrahams (00:59:33):
Yes, yes. So nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief. I'm sure it's possible, but the majority of complaints are the toast went on forever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Do you find that it would ever make sense to give a couple anecdotes or make a couple points in a toast?

Matt Abrahams (00:59:51):
Yeah, and it depends. Toasts are opportunities for teaching and learning as well, especially in a work environment. So it might make sense to tell a couple anecdotes. I'm a huge fan... I mean, your listeners know, you know minimally viable product design, agile development, really critical. What is it about? It's about understanding your audience, your users, and it's about rapidly prototyping and iterating. I believe in minimally viable communication, trademark pending, where it's the same principles. Know your audience, put together a rough draft of what you want to say, test it out. So if you're going to give a big toast in front of a company all hands, run it by a few people and say, "Is it too many anecdotes? Would it benefit from having another story?" Get people's feedback. We are not the best judges of our communication. So the answer is yes, but test it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
Another element of a great toast that you recommend is to be emotional. Can you touch on that?

Matt Abrahams (01:00:50):
Well, so emotion connects with people, and as long as it's genuine and authentic, it's really important. I've been thinking a lot about emotion and communication. My father recently passed away and everybody in my family said, "Well, Matt's going to do the eulogy." It was like, I had no choice. What do I do? I'm the guy who teaches communication. So I felt added pressure not only to honor my father's life, but everybody's like, "This is the way you do a eulogy." And so I wanted to do some research on what's all the advice out there on eulogies, and there wasn't a lot. So I actually wrote an article on my experience, and hopefully it'll help people. But the point is, in those circumstances where there's a lot of emotion, it's important because it connects to the audience, it makes it human, but sometimes the emotion can get in the way for you as a communicator. I mean, I was very concerned that my emotion would cover up or overshadow the honoring I was trying to do of my father. But the same thing can happen in any kind of toast situation.

(01:01:48):
So think about emotion. Emotion is a tool to use. The best way to convey emotion in a toast is through the anecdotes you use. The anecdotes reveal the emotion. It's one thing to say, "I am so sad." It's another thing to tell a story that is sad.

(01:02:02):
I was very fortunate to interview for my podcast coming up soon, a one-panel cartoonist. So she has to create everything in one panel. And her advice is: Don't tell, show. In that don't tell somebody you're angry, show that you're angry in the panel she writes. So showing the emotion through story and anecdote is the way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):
Have you had Matthew Dix on your podcast?

Matt Abrahams (01:02:26):
So it is so funny. I have not, and I want to. His name comes up more than anybody else's. And I know of his work and his advice, so I might ask you to connect me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
Absolutely. I thought of him as you were talking because he helps people create their eulogy ahead of time before somebody passes away, before you get really emotional and you have to rush it. So that's one of his services is he helps to write eulogies for people.

Matt Abrahams (01:02:50):
Yeah, yeah. No, I'd love an introduction. His work is very influential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Absolutely. He's amazing. We'll link his episode about storytelling.

(01:02:57):
Okay, let me talk about a couple more. Q&A, getting better at question, answer at the end of a talk, whether it's on the spot or not.

Matt Abrahams (01:03:05):
Again, I always start with approach. Many of us see Q&A as threatening or challenging, and in fact, we need to see Q&A as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, learn. Even in the most hostile of situations where people are really coming at you with a lot of spice or hot and heavy, you can get a lot of value out of it. So we have to come to the approaches. These questions are opportunities. We have to make sure that we take the question in without interrupting or over-validating the question.

(01:03:36):
I have two pet peeves about Q&A sessions. One is saying good question to every question. And two, at the end of answering the question saying, "Does that make sense?" Because in both cases, you're trying to validate the asker when you say good question. You're also trying to buy yourself time. And there are other ways to do that. And at the end when you say, "Does that make sense," you've got a laudable goal in mind, which is, "Did I answer your question?" But I'd much rather you say, "Did I answer your question? Can I tell you more? Do you have a follow-up question?"" Because if you keep saying, "does that make sense, does that make sense," people are going to start thinking, "Maybe he doesn't make sense because he is always asking." So some pet peeves there.

(01:04:15):
Once the question comes in and you have to answer it, I have yet another structure. This structure is related to the what, so what, now what structure. It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it. Would you mind role-playing an example of this with me, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):
Absolutely.

Matt Abrahams (01:04:44):
Okay. Imagine you're hiring me. You're a hiring manager, and I'm interviewing to be what I do for my day job. I'm a lecturer at Stanford's Business School, teach strategic communication. You so happen to have a position open for a strategic communication lecturer. I show up. What is a reasonable question you would ask that doesn't just have a yes no answer?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
Wait, so you're interviewing for a role to be a lecturer in my school and [inaudible 01:05:11] communication.

Matt Abrahams (01:05:11):
Yes. You're the dean. You get to hire me. What's a reasonable question? I mean, you could ask a super hard one, but I want people to hear how ADD works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
This might be too simple, but just how many students have you worked with and taught over the years?

Matt Abrahams (01:05:23):
Okay, so I'm going to morph that question because I could just say thousands, which is true, but I'm going to turn it into a question about experience, because really what you're asking me is what's my experience? So because that I can give an ADD answer too. If it's just a numeric answer, just give a number. So I might say, "I've been doing this for 25 years and I have taught over thousands of students. I've taught both in the academic world, but also in the corporate world. What this means is I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students."

(01:05:56):
So I answered the question. The question was, what's your experience? 25 years, thousands of students. I then give an example. I've done this in the corporate world, I've done this in the academic world. So I ground it in something tangible. And then I show the relevance. What this means for you as a dean hiring me, is that I'm going to be able to tailor my experience. We often assume that people can connect the dots. If I give my answer, you're going to see, "Oh, that's why this is relevant and important." But we need to actually connect those dots for our audience.

(01:06:24):
I had a psychology professor once who said, the funny thing about common sense is it's not so common, and we often make the assumption that people will connect the dots. So answer the question, give a detailed example, and then explain the relevance. And if you do that, it will help. And I challenge every one of your listeners working in companies that have FAQs, frequently asked questions, go back to those FAQs and put them in this structure. Not only will it help you digest and get familiar and comfortable with the structure, anybody looking at those answers begins to see that this is a way to give a complete answer. This is how our organization answers questions. And that can be so helpful to building consistency and helping yourself answer better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):
Just to clarify, the acronym is ADD?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:09):
ADD. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
Describe the relevance. I see how you snuck that D in there.

Matt Abrahams (01:07:16):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can come up with whatever acronym you want that helps you remember. ADD because it adds value.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
Awesome. Okay. And maybe one last quick one, apologizing. What's a couple tips for getting better at apologizing on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:33):
First and foremost, we need to take the time to apologize. Many of us don't. And when we apologize, we need to make sure that we apologize for the transgression and not for how we made people feel. So often people will simply say, "I'm sorry that you feel bad." Well, that's not an apology. You're not assuming responsibility. So we need to first start by talking about the issue that we are addressing or the problem that we caused somebody. So we need to think about apologies in that way. So an apology to me, I have a AAA, like roadside repair service here in the United States, AAA. It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did.

(01:08:23):
So imagine we're in a meeting and I interrupted you. You were in the midst of speaking and I interrupted you. So I might say, "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." I'm acknowledging what I did.

(01:08:36):
Then I appreciate. "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." So that's the appreciation.

(01:08:46):
The amends part is, "I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done, and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." So I'm signaling I understand it, and here's the very specific thing I'm going to do to try to remedy it, which of course you can comment on. You can say, no, I don't think that's enough. I think you whatever, or thank you, I think that's even more than is needed, whatever. So you acknowledge the actual behavior and offense, not how you made the person feel right away. You then express appreciation for the difficulty you might've caused, and then you make amends. And the AAA approach, I think can really be helpful to people to be better at in-the-moment apologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):
Amazing. Matt, I think we've packed this episode with so many tactical golden nuggets to help people become better communicators, especially on the spot. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before I ask you how they can find you online and things like that?

Matt Abrahams (01:09:45):
Again, I want to go back to how we started the second part about spontaneous speaking. Everybody can get better at communication. And I encourage, I challenge people to take the steps that they need to take to do it. So it starts with initiative. It's followed by grace and a lot of compassion, it takes time. But in so doing, you can improve your communication and help others. It's not just about you finding your voice, it's about you sharing that voice with others. So taking the time to work on your communication is critically important, and I encourage everybody to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:18):
All right. I'm hoping people will follow that advice. And if not, think back to what we talked about at the beginning of just how much impact these have and how many people are also going through the same challenges you're probably feeling speaking and being on the spot. All right, where can folks find your podcast, your book, and also how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Abrahams (01:10:37):
Oh, I love that last question. So mattabrahams.com, great place to go to to find things. So at mattabrahams.com you'll find a whole bunch of resources. My own and others. I've curated a bunch of resources. You can find Think Fast, Talk Smart wherever you get podcasts and on YouTube. And then the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is available everywhere.

# The surprising truth about what closes deals: Insights from 2.5m sales conversations | Matt Dixon

## Transcript

Matt Dixon (00:00):
We collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05):
The big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals, not to competition, but to indecision.

Matt Dixon (00:12):
And that indecision stems from their fear of failure. Dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20):
You just talk about how to actually leverage these insights to improve your sales process. You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?

Matt Dixon (00:25):
Yeah, JOLT them forward. The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to start trusting us and we call it limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to de-risk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38):
Great segue to The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids. 

Matt Dixon (00:41):
Most salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night. The challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What's a risk that they don't know about but you do. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51):
Holy moly, this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. Today, my guest is Matt Dixon. Matt is one of the world's foremost experts in sales, known for his groundbreaking research into what makes the best salespeople different from everyone else. His first book, The Challenger Sale, was a number one Wall Street Journal bestseller and has sold over a million copies worldwide. His most recent book, The JOLT Effect, builds on his lessons and insights and will change how you do sales. 

(01:23):
In our conversation, Matt breaks down what you're probably doing wrong in your sales process based on research, into millions of sales conversations, and then how to tweak your process to be a lot more successful. This episode is for anyone that wants to improve their sales skills or improve the rate at which they close deals.

Matt Dixon (01:59):
It's great to be here. Thank you for the invitation, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01):
It's great to have you here. First of all, a huge thank you to April Dunford for connecting us. She's a huge fan of your work. She mentioned you a number of times on the podcast episode that she did. She's great. 

Matt Dixon (02:11):
Yeah, she's very nice. 

Lenny Rachitsky (02:12):
She's amazing. You basically spend your time researching salespeople and digging into what makes the best salespeople different from all the rest, and then synthesizing these lessons into these really actionable pieces of advice so that anyone can become better at sales, which to me feels like a dream come true even if I'm not a salesperson, even though many of us do sales part-time, but especially if you're a salesperson. 

(02:40):
First of all, just to give people a sense of the work that you do, could you just talk a bit about the research that went into the books that we're going to talk about, we're going to be focusing on The Challenger Sale and The JOLT Effect. What is the research they did?

Matt Dixon (02:53):
Yeah, sure. Just start with The Challenger, because that chronologically came first. We actually started that research study in, I think it was in late 2008 actually, and we published the initial results to, at the time I was working for a company called CEB, which was acquired by Gartner Group in 2017, a research organization, and then I was running the group that served heads of sales, business, business heads of sales around the world. We had five or 600 clients around the world, and we launched that study in '08. 

(03:24):
We published the initial results for our clients in '09. We kept collecting some data and then we published the book in 2011. The book was published off a data set of 6,000 salespeople, so we did an in-depth survey with 6,000 salespeople, as well as collected performance data on those 6,000 sellers. It was a global, cross industry, different types of companies as well, product companies, services companies, large, small, slow growth, fast growth, you name it.

(03:50):
Overtime, though, that research has been ongoing, so we've collected data. I think to date, on roughly a quarter million salespeople around the world that we continue to go back and not just validate the original findings, but look at how things are changing and do cuts of the data now that the data set's so big. That was a survey based piece of research we did. 

(04:11):
The JOLT Effect, we started that research in 2020, actually. It was actually in March of 2020, which I think is a time that everybody remembers with probably mixed emotions, most of them bad. I think though, you remember March was a time when people were getting into Tiger King and baking sourdough bread. A few months later, that got really old, but in the beginning it was kind of surprising and weird and this whole pandemic thing, but we actually thought because we're huge nerds, that this would be an interesting time to do a sales research project.

(04:44):
We had always been fascinated by what Professor Neil Rackham did back in the '70s and '80s and spin selling, and he and his research team sat in on 30 something thousand sales calls, physically sat in on these meetings and took notes. They're a team of psychologists to produce the research that went into spin selling, and so we always kind of aspire to get, if you will, at the coal face or where the rubber hits the road in sales, which is the sales conversation when that salesperson is sitting across from the customer. 

(05:11):
The problem with that is it's really hard to get people to pay for that kind of research, that kind of undertaking, and then let alone, getting invited into those meetings because a lot of the really critical sales meetings took place, of course, in the client's office. Until March of 2020 when that all changed and the entire sales process for every company on Earth went to Zoom and Teams and Webex and other virtual platforms.

(05:34):
We recruited several dozen companies across industry and around the world into a large global study, and we collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale. That was a very different kind of research project and honestly, it's fun just as a researcher to look back on Challenger and the manual survey-based approach and the interviews and all this stuff to fast forward to today, being able to take advantage of large data sets and advance technology to study millions of sales conversations is pretty cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:07):
Amazing. Okay, so the second book, the most recent book, The JOLT Effect is based on these two and a half million sales conversations. 

Matt Dixon (06:13):
Mm-hmm. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:14):

(08:05):
Let's dive into the insights from The JOLT Effect. The way that I understand is the big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals not to competition, but to indecision. Basically, customers preferring to do nothing versus choosing something because they are afraid of making a mistake.

Matt Dixon (08:24):
Good summary. Yeah, [inaudible 00:08:25], if you're busy, you said it more succinctly. I've been doing this for a while now and you said it way more succinctly than I can. Just to back up for a little bit, I think one of the data points I always start with when I present the research on The JOLT Effect is that our analysis showed that anywhere between 40 and 60% of the average salesperson's qualified pipelines, these aren't just leads, sometimes bad leads that are thrown over to us by marketing, these are qualified opportunities. 

(08:53):
These are people we've met with, customers we've pursued, we've engaged, they're in the sales process, 40 to 60% of them will be ultimately marked as closed loss, no decision. That's actually, I think that number is actually on the rise, especially in places like SaaS and the broader tech sector over the past year and a half, but that's a really painful thing. 

(09:13):
If you think about as a salesperson, that for 46% of your deals, you're going to spend a lot of time, energy, resources, a lot of your company's money and their time and resources pursuing these opportunities where you eventually just get ghosted and you don't really know what happened, just like the customer, the opportunity evaporated on you, they ghosted you, they want radio silent. You don't really know what happened there. 

(09:35):
We decided to take this two and a half million sales call dataset, which you could have used to answer lots of different questions, but we were really fascinated by this question, maybe two, two questions. One is why do customers make no decision? Because you understand it's frustrating as a salesperson, but it's also puzzling for customers to do that. They go through the entire process to evaluate a solution, and many of those customers say, "Yeah, I want to buy," and then they ghost to the salesperson and it's so puzzling. 

(10:02):
Why would they waste their own time evaluating a solution than doing nothing? Then, the more important question is probably what are the very best salespeople do differently? What have they figured out to avoid that outcome? 

Lenny Rachitsky (10:13):
Cool, and we're going to talk about that latter part to help people understand why, because it sounds like, okay, I guess this happens, but help people understand why this happens. Why are people nervous to make a mistake and not make a decision at all?

Matt Dixon (10:24):
Let me maybe take us a step back, Lenny. There was a reason we actually even asked that question that you just asked, and the reason was this, when we looked at sales calls, if you think of the typical sales process or buying journey, it kind of moves through three phases. Phase number one, is the customer in their status quo. It's what they do today. They use your competitor's product. Maybe they do use a homegrown solution, maybe they never saw a need for a solution like yours, but that's their current state. 

(10:51):
Step two is we've got to get them to agree that the current state is no longer acceptable and they've got to move forward in a new and different way. We call that agreement on a vision. We've got to get their intent to move forward and to change, and that step number three is you got to get them to buy something. That's the action step where they execute the docuSign, they sign on the line that is dotted and they send the contract back. 

(11:11):
It's a simple three step process, and what we found in our analysis is one of the big places where a lot of deals fall out of that process is between intent and action. It's after the point where the customer says, "Yeah, Lenny, this sounds great. I'm sold. Let's talk." But before the point where that actually deal gets sold, a lot of deals kind of go sideways in that moment and the way this comes across in sales calls is that customers start, if you will, relitigating concerns that they had asked and you thought you'd address much earlier, like what might go wrong and is this really the right answer for us? 

(11:45):
These are things that are puzzling to salespeople because it feels like this thing is slipping through my fingers right before my eyes. I thought we had this closed. I thought you said you want to move forward and now you're asking questions that we addressed three months ago, what's going on? 

(11:58):
What salespeople tend to do, because they've grown up in a world where they've been told, the only reason the customer hesitates is because you haven't put to bed their status quo bias. We all know, we're all human beings, not just customers, but perhaps especially customers, are guilty of status quo bias, meaning we are prone to laziness and doing nothing because it's easier, it's inertia. It's easier to just keep doing more of the same than to change behavior. 

(12:23):
Change is really hard and salespeople have been taught that the status quo is their biggest competitor, and if the customer is starting to get cold feet, it's because they still think either what they're doing today is good enough, what you are proposing is not a compelling enough reason to change, or maybe it's just not a top priority for them or their organization. It's got to be one of those reasons. 

(12:43):
What salespeople have been armed to do is go out and dial up the FOMO and make the customer sweat a little bit. The first thing they do is they say, "Lenny, remember the demos and the proof of concept trial, how excited you were and those benefits, you got to pay for it. You're not going to get all those great benefits for your organization unless you sign the agreement." 

(13:03):
If that doesn't work, I'll try to kind of scare you into action by dialing up the fear, uncertainty and doubt and saying, "Lenny, you told me about these problems in your business. You guys are really struggling right now. By the way, did I mentioned, we're working with all of your competitors and they're seeing tremendous benefits from our product and you're going to be left in the dust and those problems you brought up with me, they're not going to solve themselves." 

(13:22):
I'm trying to create that burning platform a little bit for the customer and get them to realize the cost of their inaction. There is a cost of doing nothing, and if those two things don't work, what most salespeople go to is the 10% discount that's only good this quarter. It's like the price driven urgency. Maybe this will be the thing you need to just get you over the finish line. 

(13:43):
What we were so surprised by which led us to the question you asked, Lenny, was that 87% of the time when salespeople do that dial up the FOMO in those moments, especially with a customer who says that they're ready to move forward, but they start to backpedal and waffle and waiver and become hesitant dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. In other words, it increases the odds, the deal will be lost to no decision.

(14:06):
If it weren't for that finding, we never would've even bothered asking the question about why do people end up, why do we lose deals to no decision, why do customers make no decision, but this was really puzzling because it flew in the face of everything we talked about, including in Challenger, to be totally candid. We talked about how challengers are exceptional at breaking the customer's status quo bias by showing them the pain of same is worse than the pain of change. 

(14:29):
Again, overcoming that inertia, that not just individuals but organizations suffer from. Challengers are really good at that. Here, we see that the tactics that you might associate with challenging actually kind of backfire, which was, as the author of The Challenger, still a little bit troubling to me, but we'll come back to that, but I think what we realized was we got it right, but we got it kind of half right.

(14:50):
We went into the data and we asked a slightly different question, which is why are deals lost in no decision? What drives that? We found that actually, there are a lot of deals that are lost because the customer does actually prefer their status quo. That is status quo bias. They believe what they're going to say is good enough, what you're talking about, it's not a compelling enough reason to change or this is not a top priority. 

(15:11):
Those are all status quo preference reasons, but it turns out those are only 44% of the no decision losses, 56% of no decision losses are customers who want to buy but can't buy because they're stuck in this no man's land of indecision, and that indecision itself stems from their fear of failure, which you put your finger on earlier, and this is the part I found so fascinating, so we dug into the psych research. We read probably 30 years of cognitive psychology journal articles, many of them from Dutch universities, which I find very interesting, but a fairly very big into this stuff. 

(15:49):
A lot of the Kahneman and Tversky work around loss aversion and prospect theory, et cetera, and one of the big findings we came across is that there's actually a more powerful human bias, even more powerful than status quo bias that rears its ugly head and causes indecision, and that is called the omission bias. 

(16:06):
The omission bias is, if you get down to it, is the fact that people don't want to be blamed for making decisions that lead to a loss. In the human mind, there are two types of loss that we think about. We all like to avoid loss, but not all loss is created equal. There are losses that happen when we do nothing, and then there are losses that happened because we did something. 

(16:25):
We made a decision, we picked a vendor, we executed a contract, and then something bad happened. It turns out that in the human mind, people are okay with missing out. They are not okay with messing up and being blamed, and this is really powerful. It's even more powerful than status quo bias, as I said. 

(16:44):
The shorthand for salespeople is this, dialing up the FOMO can be very effective to overcome status quo bias, but knowing that every human being, including all of your customers, who I include in that definition of human beings are definitely afraid of being personally blamed if things go wrong. The FOMU actually matters more than the FOMO. The FOMU is the fear of messing up or in the not safe for work version of your podcast, I'd say FOFU, but your listeners can figure out what that stands for on their own, but this is really powerful for salespeople, right to understand. 

(17:16):
Look, if you are trying to scare your customer into action, you're going to miss out on these benefits. You're going to miss out on solving these problems. You're just going to pay more later if you don't say yes now. What you're really doing is using scare tactics, but you're trying to scare somebody who's already afraid. The problem is they're not afraid of the thing you think they're afraid of. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up. 

(17:36):
We've got to address that as salespeople. We've got to help instill the confidence in the customer that you're making a great decision. I've got your back. You're going to look like a hero, not like a fool and that's really what The JOLT Effect is about. It's about how the very best salespeople execute that. It wasn't that we're wrong with Challenger, it's just the story was kind of incomplete. 

(17:55):
You got to break status quo bias. If you don't do that, you're never going to have an indecision problem, but even once you overcome the customer's indifference and their status quo bias, you got to second battle you've got to fight, which is you've got to instill the confidence and make them feel good about this. Frankly, leap of faith they're about to take and their fear, you got to deal with the fear that if something goes wrong, they're worried that they're going to be blamed for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:16):
We're going to talk about this method you developed for how to actually do all the things you're talking about, but first, to make this even more real, what I'm thinking about is an example. Is a good example, maybe a CRM, like a better CRM product, say someone has Salesforce installed and now they're like, maybe there's probably something better out there we should probably evaluate. 

(18:34):
Then, I'm thinking from the perspective of a startup trying to build a better CRM. There's always this advice, you have to be 10 times better for anyone to pay any attention. I think that feeds into exactly what you're showing is it needs to be so much better that this fear is reduced. Can you just talk about maybe an example, whether it's that one or a different one to make this more concrete?

Matt Dixon (18:52):
We encountered a ton of examples. It's so interesting you mentioned startups and I think sometimes, I was actually with a big enterprise software company and I think when, and I presented this research to some of their sales leaders and one of the folks in the room said, "I'm really glad we are who we are, that we are the 800-pound gorilla, especially in a market like we're in right now," because as the old adage goes, it wasn't IBM, but the old adage is that nobody ever got fired for buying from IBM, right? 

(19:21):
This company is like the IBM of their space. They're the 800-pound gorilla. They've got the brand strength, the reputation, they're the safe choice. This team felt kind of comfortable or comforted, I should say by that fact, especially in a tight environment where it's a battle for deals and for mindshare and for wins out there in the market right now, especially in tech.

(19:42):
What I said is you've got to remember though, that may be true, and I would argue, and I think you're right, that for a startup, yeah, you've got to be 10 times better to get that mind share. It may be even better than that to get somebody to take a leap of faith with you. There is inherent risk in going with the unproven player, but I cautioned these folks and I said, "Now, remember, what are the things that drive fear of failure and indecision?" 

(20:08):
It turns out there are three big ones. The first one is have I made the right choice? I know I want to work with this vendor, but did I configure the solution of the proposal the right way, the right contract length, the right implementation, the right used cases, the right integrations, all that professional services or DIY, all those big questions.

(20:26):
The second thing that customers worry about in their second fear of failure is that they're going to learn something after the contract is signed that's going to make the decision look like not such a great decision. I'll give you a really specific example about this. I spoke to a tech company not too long ago, maybe a month ago, and they landed their biggest deal of their existence. It was an early stage company, seven-figure deal, game changer for this organization. Then, they beat out some big established competitors. This is a huge win. 

(20:54):
They went out. They celebrated. It was just totally amazing, their first big enterprise win and their first seven-figure deal and their first victory against some of these incumbents. Unfortunately, about two weeks after they won this deal, the new Gartner Magic Quadrant on their space came out and they were shown to be kind of, eh, right? They weren't the leader, but they were sort of middle of the pack.

(21:16):
All of a sudden, the client who signed the agreement, the CTO just got crap rained from everybody saying, "Did you see the Gartner Magic Quadrant? It looks like the company we just plunked down seven figures with was kind of seen as so-so by the Gartner analyst? Have we talked to these guys and those guys and why aren't we going with the leaders," and blah, blah, blah? 

(21:36):
They ended up backing out of the contract because the CTO said, "I'm spending every day talking to all the other key stakeholders trying to convince them that yes, we did all of our due diligence, but life is too short and we're probably going to end up going with one of the big players. We're sorry. I mean, that's such a painful story, but that's the customer is like they're going to keep doing research because they don't want to be surprised when some new piece of information comes to light. It's the second big fear of failure driver or failure driver. 

(22:03):
The third one is that the customers are worried they're just not going to see the ROI. They're not going to get the full benefits. You might project for them a 5X improvement in sales productivity. What if it comes in at two or three X and my name's on the agreement and the CFO comes asking why we didn't get the benefits we thought? In today's environment, that's not just egg on your face, you could get fired for that stuff. 

(22:26):
This is the client who's really looking for that vendor to have their back and to assure them that they're going to see the benefits that are being projected and promised through the sale. What I said to this big enterprise tech company was, "Look, you guys, yes, it's tough to be a startup right now, early stage company, there's a lot of risks there, but who's offering more choices, them or you guys? You guys have a partner ecosystem. You have 20 different cloud products. You bought seven companies in the past three years. You have a cornucopia of options, which adds to the buyer's anxiety that they haven't chosen the right thing. 

(22:59):
Second, do you think there's more written about you guys or about them? You could fill a football stadium with all the coverage on you guys. I mean, everybody's got an opinion about you because you are the 800-pound gorilla and everybody's worked with you before and they have opinions, good and bad, and people want to leave no stone unturned. 

(23:17):
Then, lastly, it turns out you guys are a lot more expensive because you're trying to move from selling simple products like these ankle biters out there, these startups into selling big enterprise solutions. You guys are selling not seven-figure deals, eight-figure deals, nine-figure deals to your customers. That increases the customer's anxiety that I really have to see return on this. 

(23:36):
You, in many respects, are getting whipsawed by these factors in a way that the startups are not because they don't have as many choices. There's not as much coverage about that. The investment is lower, and so there's a little bit less risk for the customer. You guys aren't immune just because you're the big brand."

Lenny Rachitsky (23:53):
You're doing a great job making it clear why it's so nerve-racking to buying new software. There's just so many things that could hurt you as a person at a company. April Dunford, I think this is barred from your language that she talks about how it's actually more stressful these days to buy software than to sell software because of all these things you've talked about.

Matt Dixon (24:13):
Yeah, I think she's on point on that one. I mean, your customers are, yeah, they're really, really afraid of this not panning out. It was so interesting, and salespeople can think of so many different occasions where the purchase buying your product, just made all the sense in the world for the customer, it would make things so much better. It would solve such big problems for them. 

(24:37):
They're so dissatisfied with their current approach. It's just a no-brainer, and the customer will look at that and they will agree with you and they still won't make a decision because of the what-ifs, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (24:47):
Yeah. This is got to be very frustrating for founders to listen to and be like, "Come on, our product is so much better. What are you doing?" But I think this explains a lot of the challenges they're probably having.

(26:02):
It's a great segue to talking about how to actually leverage these insights to improve your sales process. You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?

Matt Dixon (26:10):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:11):
Awesome. Let's get into it.

Matt Dixon (26:12):
The JOLT, it's an acronym. It just so happened it worked out that way, but I like it because it's memorable, but it also speaks to what's happening. Our customers' stuck in their indecisive state. They want to buy from us, but they just can't because worried about what might go wrong. You got to JOLT them forward. We got to JOLT them into action.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:12):
Beautiful. 

Matt Dixon (26:30):
How do we do it? The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision, we've got to figure out what we're dealing with. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to stop doing endless research and start trusting us and limiting, we call limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to the derisk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table, and we establish that safety net for the customer so they feel like we've got their back. 

(26:49):
Maybe we talk about each of those. I'll start with the J because it's first, but also I think the way, while it's kind of linear, I would encourage listeners don't think about this as a process where it's like I do step one, two, three, four, J-O-L-T. Think of it as it starts with the J, and the J tells you what the next step is. Is it the T? Is it the L? Is it the O? Is it the O, and then we got to deal with the T. Then, we got to go back to the O because it comes up again. 

(27:14):
Think of it as sort of the dividing rod. How do we figure out what's got the customer nervous? This is a really, really, really tricky thing because, and I've likened indecision to the carbon monoxide poisoning of sales. It's everywhere, but it's odorless, it's tasteless, but you need a carbon monoxide detector, and that's what the J is. 

(27:37):
How do we get fear of failure on the table? The problem with this is that, and I think most of your listeners will be familiar with this, everybody, especially customers suffers and senior executives especially, especially, suffer from what's called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is they think they're better at things than they really are and decisiveness is one of those things that buyers will think they will say they think they're decisive. 

(28:00):
In fact, if you surveyed your customers, not that they recommend this, and you add 100 of them, if they consider themselves to be decisive folks, like 99 out of 100 will say, "Absolutely, yes, I make the tough calls. I manage from the gut. I live on the edge as an executive making those big calls," but the research tells a very different story. It turns out that 87% of buyers in our two and a half million sales calls we studied, either showed moderate or high levels of indecision. 

(28:25):
The folks who are not worried about fear or failure were 13%. Yeah, those people do exist. By the way, if you find one of those people, you should sell them everything as soon as possible because they're making the decision quite literally on the dollars and cents and the ROI and whether it makes sense for their business. It's a rational decision for them, but for the rest, they're dealing with a lot of emotion, and that emotion is all wrapped up with fear of failure. 

(28:48):
What's so tough about this is that it's not just Dunning-Kruger like we think we're more decisive than we really are, even if your customer knows that they're indecisive or they're worried about failing or how their boss is going to perceive them, if this purchase doesn't pan out, they don't like talking about it because it's embarrassing. They don't want to talk about like, "God, I got to tell you this better pay off because if it doesn't, I'm already on thin ice with my boss. She doesn't like me already. This is going to be the last straw." Nobody's going to say that stuff. 

(29:17):
How do we get on the table? One of the things we don't think works particularly well are classic open-ended questions like, "Lenny, do you find when you go to the Cheesecake factory, do you leave satisfied or hungry because you can't decide what to order?" I guess, it's not great approaches with customers, you'll end the sale pretty quickly because again, your customers find that kind of offensive. They'd like to think of themselves as decisive people. 

(29:39):
We found a technique, this is actually not in the book, we found it after we wrote the book, called pings and echoes that high performers use. Think of the way a surface ship might detect a submarine in the water using sonar. They send a ping out into the water and they're listening, if you will, using sonar for the reflection back and the reflection tells them, is it a friendly submarine, an enemy submarine? Is it just a whale? Is it heading towards us? Away from us? At what speed are they about to torpedo us? All that good stuff. 

(30:08):
We want to do the same thing in sales. The way this works is that a salesperson will try to articulate but in a non, not to out the customer, but to get confirmation or refutation, if you will, that what they've articulated is actually a concern for their buyer. 

(30:25):
Hypothetically, let's imagine we're talking about a purchase and we've had a lot of great conversations. I've shown you a lot of demos. You guys have liked everything we've shown. We showed you partner options. We showed you different configurations. We did POC over here. We did a pilot over there. You guys are just eating it all up, but I'm kind of getting the sneaking feeling that you guys actually don't know what you want and we've shown you a lot and we've probably made that problem worse. 

(30:49):
What I might say to you is, "Lenny, I'm just curious if we could calibrate here for just a moment, and there's a reason I'm asking this, which is a lot of the customers at this point in our process of working together, they get almost overwhelmed with all the options, and look, I probably made this worse. We're very proud of what we do. I want to show you, paint the art of the possible, but I also know if we're going to do business together, you told me right away budgets are limited and you can't have it all. You've got to decide what's nice to happen and what's need to happen. I'm just curious, are you and your team clear on what would be in and out of the proposal?" 

(31:25):
What's going to happen is one of two things, one you might say, or a few things, you might say, "You know what? No, we don't know and we have liked everything you've shown us, but as you said, we can't have it all. So, we'd be really curious to know what do other companies like us start with? How do we get going? What are the things we can do without and we can maybe add later on down the road," or you might get the customer says, "No, no, no, we were just being polite. There's a lot of stuff you showed us that we're not actually that interested in. It's cool, but it's just not for us. We are very clear on what we want. 

(31:55):
So, let me share that with you now. However, what I'm really concerned about is once we get this kind of specked out and configured and priced, I'm going to take it to the CFO because I've got to get her approval on this and I can't build our business case on the claim you guys make about improving sales productivity by 10% because she'll laugh me out of her office. Help me get grounded in what's a believable outcome for us so that I can sell it and I can be confident we're going to actually hit it." 

(32:25):
Again, it's not designed to embarrass the customer, it's designed to get this on the table so it can be recognized and dealt with and contextualized. You're totally normal. Everybody struggles with this. There's a lot of stuff we throw in front of people and it ends up doing some harm. They don't know what to pick. Let me be of service and value to you. 

(32:42):
That's the first thing that we point to and that's going to tell us, okay, is it a choice problem? They're overwhelmed. They don't know what to choose, like that example we just used. Is it that they're just doing endless research and they feel like they haven't really come down the learning curve yet around this purchase or is it, no, I don't actually know that we're going to get what we're paying for here and we screw this stuff up every day of the week at twice a Sunday and I don't think it's going to be any different and then I'm going to get blamed, so help me manage the downside risk, but it tells us kind of where to go next on that journey, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (33:12):
Yeah. Awesome. The advice there is basically get a sense of how clear they are internally on knowing exactly what they want that'll help them make a decision. There's kind of this moment of, okay, let's just help me understand the question, the way you phrased it, are you and your team clear on what would be in or out of this proposal?

Matt Dixon (33:31):
Yeah. That's just a one example. That's if I hypothesize that you're really struggling with what to choose. Now, my hypothesis might be, you know what you want. You've done plenty of research, but you're really worried about the ROI and you're just worried you just aren't going to be able to accomplish that. 

(33:47):
That ping might sound very different. It might be we've been having a discussion about, you've been asking for multiple terms of the ROI calculation and changing parameters and really trying to make it bulletproof, but a lot of customers struggle with that a little bit because that's a big thing. You're putting your name against that. Maybe we should have a conversation about whether that's a concern for you. Is there a believability gap? Is there an execution gap you're worried about on your side or on our side? 

(34:15):
Let's have a conversation about that so I can set the proper expectations so you feel really confident going to the CFO and lobbying for investment here. That ping could go in, but it's based on what I think is holding you up.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:28):
Got it. It's just like at this point, many customers have this question... 

Matt Dixon (34:32):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:33):
... and that maybe comes from the thing that you think is probably blocking them. 

Matt Dixon (34:36):
Yeah, I think that's perfect language. At this point, most customers like you, are thinking about this or they're worried about that, or they're getting a little anxious about this. Let's have a conversation about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:46):
Awesome. Okay, cool. Let's go to step two, offering your recommendation.

Matt Dixon (34:50):
Sure. Oh yeah. This was right with that example we talked about before. Options are really a double-edged sword. What we know from the research is that options are great early on. If you're meeting at the trade show and the customer's swinging by your booth or you're doing a first demo or first, let a thousand flowers bloom, but if you want the customer to actually make a decision, you've got to get the weed whacker out and call it down to a manageable set of choices. 

(35:17):
The science is very clear on this, that too many choices at some point will overwhelm the customer and it leads to a lot of bad outcomes. It leads to the customer not making a decision at all because they don't want to make the wrong decision. I don't want to work with you, but you put so many options in front of us. I don't want to be blamed if I choose the wrong one and it leads to things like post-decision dysfunction, which is, I thought I made the right decisions, but now I'm learning more and people are asking hard questions and maybe I need to go revisit this. Hey, Lenny, we're going to have to scrap that agreement and start over because I don't think we can figure this right way. 

(35:49):
We have to, there's a time and place to offer options, and there's a time and place to narrow choices up. The simple guidance here for salespeople is that you've got to shift your posture from asking the customer what they want and just diagnosing their needs, to actually recommending to them what they should do. Salespeople get a little bit anxious about this, I find, because they don't want to be seen as like, I told you to do A, but you're like, I don't want to do that. I want to do B and now I feel like we're at odds. 

(36:16):
They worry about that. Salespeople have grown up in this world that it's the customer's choice. The customers always right, let me just guide them, but they're the ones should make this decision, but sometimes the customer can't and they don't know enough about these decisions. We know the stuff because we eat, sleep, and breathe it every day as salespeople. We work in this industry, they don't. 

(36:35):
We are in a much better position to be able to guide them toward, you know what? You don't really need X, Y, and Z. You can leave that out of the proposal. Companies like you, they get started in this way. Let me put three options in front of you. I would go with the middle one because I really think that's going to be the best for you in the first year, and then we can expand from there.

(36:54):
Here's an analogy, I'll often tell people to think about the last time they went to a fancy restaurant and they looked at a menu with some expensive entrees and everything looked delicious, but they didn't know what to order, so you asked the wait person what they recommend. How helpful is it if that wait person says to you, "Well, what are you in the mood to eat tonight?" It's no help at all, right? You're no closer to a decision. They basically just dump the problem back on your lap.

(37:17):
But what a great way people do is they say, "If you want my opinion, I love this dish and I'd probably say it's our most popular. We sell out of it every night. We've still got it. So you're in luck. It's a lot of food though, it's a big portion. If you're in the mood for something lighter, there's a vegetarian option. It doesn't get as much play on Yelp, but I love this one. It's absolutely delicious. It's one of our kind of dark horse favorites, if you will, but remember, everything we make here is delicious. If you don't like those choices, you're not going to go wrong with any of them, but those are just my favorites." 

(37:46):
Now, what happens in that moment is what psychologists call the delegation effect, which is rather than the burden of a bad decision being solely on the shoulders of the decider, that burden is now shared. Now, think about it, if you order the dish the wait person recommended and you don't like it, whose fault is it? Well, technically it's your fault because you ordered it, but it's also kind of their fault because they recommended it. 

(38:07):
You feel like there's some safety in getting that recommendation, that endorsement. It's a really simple example, but it works in complex sales as well. Customers are looking for somebody to share in the risk and the burden of making a bad decision and having that partner who's guiding them toward what they should care about and what they shouldn't care about, what they should consider and what they should take out of the proposal, is actually very reassuring and comforting them and it increases the odds of getting some kind of decision from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:35):
Amazing. This is a great segue to The Challenger Sale, which we're going to talk about, but let's get through the last two steps and then we'll talk about The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids, this idea on steroids.

Matt Dixon (38:45):
The last two, so L is about this customer who's doing endless amounts of research. Every salesperson has seen this customer, they're never happy with the number of reference calls or the amount of research they've done. They want to talk to more and more people. They're just in information overload mode and/or what we might call analysis paralysis mode because at some point, they're never satisfied with, they always feel like all the answers will be in the next white paper they read or the next reference call they do, or the next person on LinkedIn they talk to. 

(39:15):
What salespeople need to do to stop that, you got to understand I think why customers do that. They don't want to be surprised. That is the main reason, but they also don't trust the salesperson to be forthcoming. They believe the salesperson is paid to sell them more than they need, to put one over on them, hide the dirty laundry, only talk about the things that work in the platform, not the things that don't work. 

(39:37):
You're not going to get introduce any of the customers who hate you. You're only going to introduce the customers who love you, and we know we're going to say great things about us. That's what the customer thinks. That is what is in the customer's mind. You've got to actually shift, get the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as an expert. There are two keys to that. 

(39:57):
The first one is you've got to establish some trust. I know that sounds like a platitude, but we found in the analysis, there are specific things that great salespeople do very early on. They are brutally transparent with customers about like, "Hey, I know you were interested in this capability. I got to be honest, we get mixed reviews on that. It's kind of an early capability for us. We're still trying to iron out the kinks," or "I know you are interested in this used case, but I have to be honest, we're actually not the best in the market at that. Our competitors much better at that than we are." 

(40:26):
These kinds of moments show the customer that you're not here to put one over on them. You're here to get them to a great decision. It kind of makes no difference to the salesperson, whether the customer buys from them, doesn't buy from them, it buys from a competitor. You just want to help them get to a great decision. That's step number one is building that trust. 

(40:42):
Step number two is you got to demonstrate some expertise. What we see in so many sales interactions, especially in tech, is that salespeople will show up with the clown car of experts, the subject matter experts, the solutions engineers, the product people, the executive sponsors, and then they will just punt to these people. 

(41:00):
What happens in that moment is dangerous for the salesperson. The customer, it sounds like they're loving it, right? They're loving that. I'm talking to the people who really know their stuff, but what's also happening in that moment is the salesperson is actively getting delegated down to the person they sound like. If they don't sound like any more than a glorified emcee or a coordinator, then that's kind of all the customer will perceive them as. 

(41:21):
What right or ability would you have to guide the customer on what to choose if you've offered no value or expertise? You don't have to be as deep as the product people. You're not going to be, you're a salesperson, you're not a product person, but you do have to be deeper on than the customer, and you do have to demonstrate that expertise. Those are the keys, again, the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as their expert.

(41:43):
Then, the T is taking risk off the table. Two keys to doing that, I think the first one happens really early actually, and that is resetting the customer's expectations. Average salespeople love when they get an inbound lead from a customer who says, "Hey, I saw that case study on your website of the customer who got the 10X improvement in sales productivity, and we want that. That sounds great." That company's in our industry, amazing. That's a slam dunk business case for us. 

(42:09):
The average salesperson's thinking like, "If you're excited about that, I'm not going to talk you out of it because that means you're going to be excited to take in the CFO and excited to sign the agreement and get going." 

(42:16):
What great salespeople do though is they know that while they'll stand by those claims, those case studies, those proof points, they try to kind of under-promise and over-deliver and they might say something along the lines of, "You know Lenny, absolutely, that is a great case. I was involved in that sale, but what we also need to understand is everything went perfectly. They resourced it to the hilt. They had no integration issues, no hiccups. It was beautiful and seamless. I don't think you and I can think of many technology implementations that happened that way. 

(42:45):
What I'd rather we do is build your business case around a 5X improvement in sales productivity because we see that at least that, in 100% of our implementations. Then, let's set up to over-deliver against that because I think we're going to do better than that based on what I know about your organization, easily 6, 7, 8, 9%, maybe even 10, but we don't want you to just walking in and promising 10X improvement sales productivity. If we finish the year and we're at 7X, if the CFO is now asking her questions when in absolute terms, she should be thrilled with 7X, right? Let's make sure we set ourselves up for success." 

(43:18):
The other thing you've got to do though is establish some safety net options. There are lots of different shapes and forms. These can take everything from before the deal is closed, pulling the implementation team onto the call, or the customer success team or the account management team so we can start roadmapping, "Hey, as soon as we get signature, here's how we're going to spend our next six months together to make sure you guys are getting all the value you expect, if not more. Here's what we got to do. Here are the stage gates, here are the owners, here are the metrics we're going to monitor. Here's how often we're going to connect with each other." 

(43:48):
Instills a lot of confidence with the customer because it feels like, "Oh, you guys have done this before, right? You've been there, you've done that. You've helped other customers like me get value." Everything from that kind of stuff to adding in professional services support, especially like you think about a tech purchase. I'm not saying give it away for free, but you will find that high-performing salespeople will also add on professional services, but it is not just because selling more, which they are because they're high-performing salespeople. It's the way they position that.

(44:13):
They usually position it as an insurance policy. "Hey, I know you guys want to DIY this. This is one of the great things about our solution. You totally can. You got all the training support, all the videos, you got all the enablement content you need, but I know this is a big priority for you, and I think it would be really smart to carve out a slug of professional services hours that way our A team is lined up in case anything slips and if it does, we get you back up on track because the last thing we want is for you guys to be upset that you're losing ground and you're not going to deliver on the outcomes that you promised to your boss. So, let's set that up." 

(44:44):
There's lots of different ways we can create those opt out clauses in some industries are an option. Not very common in B2B, but in some cases, you can offer those or specialized contract carve outs for instance. There's lots of different things we can do to create that safety net where the customer doesn't feel like they're jumping out of an airplane by themselves, but you are the tandem skydiving instructor that's going to guide them safely to the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:05):
Amazing. All of this, especially this last step, is coming from, they're probably not going to decide on anything that that's what you're fighting is help them...

Matt Dixon (45:13):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (45:13):
... be less worried about messing up.

Matt Dixon (45:15):
Yeah, that's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (45:16):
I especially love this point about under promising and over delivering because so much of, and most of this is B2B SaaS software that you're working with, right? Like B2B SaaS companies?

Matt Dixon (45:26):
Our dataset cut across, I think that it might just be that SaaS is the place where we're seeing the most indecision these days, but it's not suggest it's kind of an easy target, but it is rife within indecision these days, and unfortunately I think it's also rife with a lot of these missteps that salespeople make that actually make things worse, but we had data from manufacturing firms, services businesses that cut across. This was prevalent and consistent across industries.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:57):
With the under promising and over delivering, I think that's especially powerful for where most companies want to get to is net revenue retention being higher than 100% where you can expand larger within the org and it makes sense to help them set up base, feel like, wow, this is so much better than we even thought it was going to be, versus...

Matt Dixon (45:57):
Absolutely. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:15):
... it's not delivering what we thought. Amazing. Okay. Any last piece of wisdom to leave listeners with around The JOLT Effect before we move on to The Challenger Sale?

Matt Dixon (46:25):
The only thing I would suggest is that for anybody, I mean, I think just do it is this, is that you should hit the pause button when the customer, because the customers, we all know, are going to get cold feet, often late stage, and it can be very frustrating. The knee jerk reaction for almost every salesperson out there, this happened in our analysis, 75% of salespeople we studied, would immediately go out to dialing up the FOMO. 

(46:47):
Go back to doing that. You're not going to get these benefits. You're going to be stuck in this terrible state of affairs you're in right now. Dial up the cost of inaction, or let's try to use some price base or other delivery window-based urgency driver to get the customer to move forward. But just remember that if the customer's already convinced that the status quo is suboptimal, and you've already got the intent that basically again, you're using fear on top of a customer, selling into a customer who's already afraid and you're actually making it worse. 

(47:17):
Hitting the pause button and just reflecting a little bit on what's really going on here. Is it that they're indifferent or is it that they're indecisive? Those are actually two very different things.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:26):
Amazing. I know you have a meeting in 10 minutes, so this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. We've got 10 minutes talk about Challenger Sale. 

Matt Dixon (47:33):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:33):
First of all, how many copies of this book have you sold at this point?

Matt Dixon (47:37):
I think it's about a million. 

Lenny Rachitsky (47:39):
Holy moly. 

Matt Dixon (47:39):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (47:39):
That's insane.

Matt Dixon (47:39):
That's a lot, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (47:42):
Okay, so it's a legendary book in the world of sales. I imagine many people have heard of it, at least some people know the teachings. Let's spend a little time there. If I were to summarize the big insight of the book, basically it's the best salespeople challenge their prospects thinking and teach them about the market and what they should be doing versus just helping them get what they want.

Matt Dixon (47:59):
Yeah, very well said. I think one of, just like the FOMO, FOMU kind of shorthand, here's a shorthand I'd give to salespeople is most salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night, right? It's classic solution selling needs, diagnosis, et cetera. 

(48:15):
The Challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What is the thing you know that they need to know? What is the way that other customers are using your solution to generate returns and benefit for their organization? What's the risk that they don't know about but you do because by the way, you're going to talk to 10 times more customers, or I say you're going to talk to 10 of that customer in a week or 10 times more than a week than they will all year. 

(48:42):
You are a window into the outside world for them, and that's what challengers really understand. It's not free consulting though, because if you remember from the Challenger Sale, it's not just about bringing these provocative ideas that reframe the customer's understanding of the world. It's about leading to your unique benefits. What you're really trying to do is create a fire and then be the only person in town who sells the fire extinguisher that'll put it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (49:05):
Is there an example you could share of a Challenger sale type of sale?

Matt Dixon (49:08):
Yeah, we wrote a sequel to The Challenger Sale called The Challenger Customer. In that book, we talk about a case from a company called Dentsply. Dentsply, as the name would suggest, manufactures or produces dental supplies, right? They sell equipment and product into dental practices and dental offices. 

(49:27):
Years ago, Dentsply had developed, we all know, I think your listeners can all relate to this, when you go to the dentist and the hygienist is polishing your teeth or they're using the water pick, or unfortunately, maybe the dentist is using the drill. That wand has a very heavy power cord that's attached to it and it's attached to this power base and that it feeds water through there and electrical current and all those things. 

(49:51):
Dentsply had developed the world's first lightweight, ergonomic, cordless wand that drill bits could be attached to cleaning, implements, et cetera and it was a total breakthrough. Actually, when they unveiled it was pretty interesting, they gave, you remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where they opened the briefcase and then it emanates like a light emits from it. They gave all their salespeople like this little aluminum briefcase thing with this eggshell foam and a wand in there. 

(50:19):
I can't remember what it's called. Let's call it the XP-9000 Wand, but it had one demo wand in there and they would go around to dental offices and be like, "Ah." It was lit, literally, it had blue lighting inside... 

Lenny Rachitsky (50:30):
Wow.

Matt Dixon (50:30):
... and it was really cool, the reveal and they'd take it out and they give it to the dentist or the head of the dental office and they would hold it and be like, "What? It's so much lighter and it's ergonomic and this thing is cordless? It's amazing. It's a revolution." Then, the first thing they would ask is, "How much is it?"

(50:47):
When they told them it costs like three times more than the current old-fashioned wands they're using with the heavy cord, they would gently put it back in the briefcase, close the briefcase, say, "Can you give me a price on new drill bits or new like polishing attachments?" They couldn't get anybody to want to pay for this thing that was much more expensive than the old one. 

(51:06):
They did a lot of work and they figured out, they knew that this was unique. They knew this was a unique product. Nobody else in the market made this. They're the only supplier who had figured this out, total innovation, but they hadn't given the customer reason to want to pay a premium for that innovation until they figured out the connection between the equipment that hygienists use and absenteeism and workers' comp. 

(51:32):
It turns out that one of the biggest professions that where you get carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder and neck and lower back injuries is being a dental hygienist. The reason is that they're standing, holding that heavy wand being dragged down by that heavy cord at an awkward angle all day long. That's why dental offices really struggle to keep hygienists showing up, not calling in sick, not out for months at a time for reconstructive shoulder surgery, not with exorbitant health benefits claims and workers' comp claims. 

(52:08):
They came in and they revised their sales pitch. Now, when they come into the dental office, they sit down, they say, "I'd like to talk to you about your hygienist workforce. Are you guys seeing higher turnover? Have you seen any absenteeism due to carpal or lower back or neck or shoulder injuries? What are you guys doing about that? What's the cost to your business?" 

(52:26):
They get the dentist talking and the way they start talking about, "It is not just the insurance and workers' comp costs, it's stuff like when my hygienists get injured, and it's a repetitive motion business and job, when they get injured and they call in sick, I've got to reschedule all these cleanings and all these appointments, and that's a bunch of upset customers who end up then going to the practice down the street or saying bad things about me on Google reviews or what have you." 

(52:52):
There's all kinds of ripple effects for the dentist. The cost of losing a hygienist is massive and the market for hiring them is very, very tight. What Dentsply does is start the conversation there, and then they say, "One of the things that we figured out is that, based on our own independent research, one of the primary drivers of all these bad outcomes, absenteeism, repetitive motion injuries, is related to the equipment that hygienists use. It's because they're holding that old fashioned heavy wand, attached to that big heavy power cable at an awkward angle doing repetitive motion all day, but what if you could solve for that? What if that was no longer a problem?" 

(53:33):
The dentist says, "Well, how would you solve for that? There's no other technology." "That's what we got. We've had the same equipment for 30 years. Let me show you the new XP-9000. We're world's first cordless, lightweight, ergonomic drill. We can show you that it is far preferred by hygienists because they don't get injured as often because it's much easier to hold and it doesn't put stress on the joints and pinch points, if you will, where hygienists tend to experience these injuries." 

(53:58):
It's just a simple example, but you see, again, they're still selling a fancy wand, but before, they were leading with it. Let me show you this and talk about the features, benefits, and that led to how much does it cost. Now, they're leading to it. They're starting with an insight and giving the customer a reason to care about solving this business problem, and it turns out the only way to solve it is buying this XP-9000 drill from Dentsply.

Lenny Rachitsky (54:22):
The key lesson from this book, and I know we don't have a ton of time to dig into it, is start with an insight they may not be aware of. Give them a sense of where the things are going. Help them learn something about the future and the problems that they need to know about that they may not be aware of, and then transition to here is how we can solve that for you.

Matt Dixon (54:40):
Yeah, that's exactly right. Make sure those connections are really tight, right? Getting this right starts with answering the question, why should the customer buy from you instead of your competitor? It's not because you're more customer-centric or more innovative and possible to prove your competitors claim the same thing. It's not that you're the leading global solution provider of whatever you sell. 

(54:59):
It starts with the product or the way you deliver the product or something about your service delivery that only your company does you are only capable of. Nobody else can touch with the barge pole. Then, the second question is, what would have to be true for the customer to want to pay us for that, to pay a premium ideally? That's the core components, if you will, of a challenge or a conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Amazing. Matt, I promised I let you out here in time. Final questions, where can folks find your books if they want to dig in further and how can listeners be useful to you?

## Transcript

Matt LeMay (00:00:00):
More product managers and teams are getting laid off. The problem is the message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024, we still have too many teams doing work around the work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
Even if you are told to build the thing that the execs are really excited about, you're still going to get fired eventually.

Matt LeMay (00:00:15):
If you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team? Frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Which is something you call the low impact PM Death Spiral.

Matt LeMay (00:00:26):
Is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in, one way or another.

(00:00:33):
It starts with adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements until the next round of layoffs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
You have three steps to become more of an impact first product team.

Matt LeMay (00:00:42):
So the first is in setting team goals, no more than one step away from company goals. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
You're an ICPM. It's up to you. No excuses.

Matt LeMay (00:00:52):
You can follow all the best practices, but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0. 6 or a 0.7.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Matt Lameé. Matt is a longtime product leader, author of one of the most popular and practical books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

(00:01:12):
Over the course of his consulting practice, he's worked with hundreds of product teams, helping them improve how they operate and drive more impact, more consistently.

(00:01:20):
From that experience, he wrote and recently published a new book called Impact First Product Teams, that I could not agree more with.

(00:01:26):
In our conversation, Matt shares why it is so essential to align all of your work with business critical outcomes, especially if you fear layoffs at your company.

(00:01:35):
We talk about the low impact death spiral that many product teams fall into. What steps an individual product team can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organization approaches product development. Tips for how to push back on stupid ideas that execs ask you to build, and so much more.

(00:01:52):
The message in this episode is one that I believe every product manager needs to hear, especially if you don't work at a high-flying Silicon Valley tech company.

(00:02:00):
A huge thank you to Martin Erickson, Adrian Joselow, and Dan Corbin for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt LeMay (00:04:29):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm really, really excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):
I'm even more excited. You have a really interesting background. I usually don't spend time on background, but I thought this would be fun.

(00:04:38):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and your background. The beginning of your career you spent 13 years at Pitchfork reviewing music.

Matt LeMay (00:04:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):
Reviewing artists. Pitchfork was a massive deal. I don't know where it is today, but it was the most influential music review site. Is it still a big deal or is it less so?

Matt LeMay (00:04:55):
It is still a big deal. It was much less of a big deal when I started working for them and I was a 16-year-old music nerd, writing record reviews in my bedroom at my parents' apartment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
Okay, so what I'm hearing is you helped make them a big deal. Excellent. That's impacts. We're going to talk all about impact.

Matt LeMay (00:05:11):
If I were better at telling my own story, that's exactly what I'd be saying, is that before I started, I was product manager number one at Pitchfork.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:17):
Funny enough, you look at your resume, you went into product management from Pitchfork. Very typical career path.

(00:05:23):
By the way, if you're on YouTube watching, there's a lot of musical paraphernalia behind you, an awesome guitar, so clearly there's a thread of music throughout your background.

Matt LeMay (00:05:31):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
Let me ask you this question: what is most similar about making music, and even critiquing music, and building great product?

Matt LeMay (00:05:39):
The magic lies in the way people work together. That's really what I think has been the consistent thread between all the work that I've done.

(00:05:47):
I spent years as a touring musician. I still occasionally tour in my friend Will Chef's band. And it's that magic of people with different perspectives, different ideas, building into something that is somehow greater than the sum of its individual parts and perspectives.

(00:06:03):
That's what makes this interesting. That's what makes music magical. That's what makes product development interesting, especially in the age of AI.

(00:06:13):
When people have the opportunity to, I think, close themselves off from the messier parts of human interaction, from those moments where you realize that your perspective might be limited, that somebody else might be able to expose you to something, show you a way of working, show you a way of seeing that you haven't seen before, I think that those interactions, that ability to learn from and build with each other, is only going to become more valuable and more precious, frankly, as technology continues to do what technology does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:44):
Wow, what a beautiful answer.

Matt LeMay (00:06:45):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:47):
I love that. So let's get to the task at hand.

Matt LeMay (00:06:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
So you're known for writing one of the most popular books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

Matt LeMay (00:06:58):
I suppose I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:59):
Yes. Basically describes the job of a product manager very practically, very specifically, better than any other book out there.

(00:07:09):
You have a new book out called Impact First Product Teams. I asked you what the goal of this book was and you said the goal was what are the steps that individual product teams can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organizations approach product development?

(00:07:25):
And I thought this was a really nice way of framing this conversation. There's two important parts to the sentence that you gave me.

(00:07:32):
One is aligning your work to business critical outcomes, and the other is steps an individual product team can take, regardless of other business functions.

(00:07:40):
So let me start with this first part. This is kind of you named your book after this concept of impact, first: Why is aligning work to impact and to business critical outcomes so important?

Matt LeMay (00:07:51):
It's important because at the end of the day, it is those business critical outcomes against which you and your team will be evaluated. That's the reality of working for a business, right?

(00:08:02):
If you are contributing to the business in a way that the business at large can understand, that the CEO can understand, that the CFO can understand, if your team is a good investment for the business, then the business will continue making that investment.

(00:08:16):
If your team is not a good investment for the business or you don't really know if your team is a good investment for the business, but you figure you're showing up, so probably it's fine, you guess, then that puts you in a really tenuous position, and a position that I think we've all seen not work out terribly well for everybody in recent history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):
And so, what is this a reaction to? Because I imagine many people hearing this are, like, "Of course, PMs, product teams we're driving business impact, well, that's why we're here."

(00:08:44):
That's not actually the case in most cases. So first of all, just what is this reaction to? Is this the reaction to people being, like, "Oh, we're just going to build great products, we're going to listen to customers,"? Talk about the flip side of this.

Matt LeMay (00:08:55):
I mean, there's a couple of things. I think the main one is just more product managers and teams are getting laid off. That's a really scary reality right now.

(00:09:05):
And if you look at the messages that are being conveyed by CEOs when they lay off these teams, some of them are pretty clear.

(00:09:13):
The message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024 said, "We still have too many teams doing work around the work and supporting work, rather than focusing on opportunities with real impact."

(00:09:25):
And that really struck a nerve because I've been on those supporting teams before. I've done the work around the work. And I've assumed that if I was given work around the work to do, that surely it must be critical to the business, otherwise they wouldn't have hired me to do it.

(00:09:40):
I don't think that is a safe assumption to make. I think especially given that we are no longer in a zero interest rate environment, given that hiring and retaining employees is expensive, given that companies are looking at cost savings, I think we are in a moment where it is really incumbent upon each product team and each member of each product team to be able to understand, articulate, and work towards the top line business impact of their own work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Awesome. So where this comes from is, one, if you are not driving something that is directly driving business growth, you're not as valuable to the company. You're the kind of person that they'd lay off.

Matt LeMay (00:10:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):
There's also a flip side of finding a job. It feels like if you have shown impact in your resume, "Here's all the impact I've driven," this also helps you get hired. True?

Matt LeMay (00:10:31):
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's the most common resume advice I see, is show the number, show the impact, say what you did.

(00:10:40):
I have a friend who does resume coaching, and I showed her my resume a couple of years ago. And she said, "I love your resume except for one thing. Why do you write like a little girl? Say what you did, say what your contributions were. Don't say 'I helped. I may have maybe helped people do this'. Say the impact. Put the number on it." And I think I needed to hear that from her because I think there is a tendency, especially for those of us who do really thrive in that collaborative environment, who our nature is to not want to take credit for work that could only exist via the contributions of many people with diverse experiences and perspectives.

(00:11:22):
It's really hard to say, "Well, I did this and I contributed to that," but that's part of why I wrote this book at the team level, because I think for folks, like myself, who really enjoy and thrive in that team environment, if you can look at the product team as the foundational unit of impact and say, "We delivered this. We were able to work together to have this impact for the business," that feels really good and also speaks directly to the work that that team did together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):
That's a really interesting insight. I think a lot of this comes from just PMs naturally are trained to deflect credit and to include, say 'we' in everything and just this person did that. So I get where that comes from. So most listeners will probably still be thinking, "Yes, I'm driving impact, I'm great. I don't have a problem here. I don't to change, need to change anything." What are some ways to stress test your thinking? Maybe some questions to ask yourself or maybe your team of just, like, "Okay, maybe I'm not?"

Matt LeMay (00:12:17):
So the first question I ask most of the teams I work with is if you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team?

(00:12:29):
And that is a small question that can provoke some big reactions. Because, for me, when I was working as a product manager, I truly believed that my job was to find the next most defensible thing to build, build it, celebrate it, find the next most defensible thing to build, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat forever and ever.

(00:12:53):
I kind of assumed that the existence of my team was this righteous fact of the universe, right? My team would always be there for all time, and it was just a matter of us finding the next thing to work on, which meant doing discovery and making concessions to what leadership wanted and doing all that stakeholder management.

(00:13:13):
But the idea that my team came at a cost to the business, that at some point somebody might look at my team on a spreadsheet and say, "Who are these very expensive people? Why do we need them? Do we actually need them?" It just wasn't something that crossed my mind because I wasn't in the room for those conversations. That wasn't how I was thinking about my team's work.

(00:13:34):
So I like asking this question because it's a perspective shift. It gets you thinking if you were personally accountable for the existential market-level success of this business, would you invest in your team?

(00:13:52):
And frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away. They're not sure. They say, "I think so," or, "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because... " And then you can see the gears turning.

(00:14:05):
And again, to me that is a risky situation to be in because if you can't answer that question as a member of the team, nobody else in the organization is going to be as well-equipped to answer that question as you are.

(00:14:19):
So bringing that question to the team, asking it and answering it proactively and collaboratively and being ready to say, "Okay, if we can't answer this confidently, what are the changes we need to make? Do we need to change our purview? Do we need to change our goals? Who do we need to talk to? What do we need to do in order to make this happen, in order to answer that question confidently?" We are much better off having that conversation at the team level than waiting for someone else to have it for us, or at us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
So is kind of the signal here is if you can't confidently say yes, asking yourself this question or your team talking through this and having a clear answer, there's maybe a potential problem that you need to work on?

Matt LeMay (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I think that's exactly it, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:04):
And we'll talk about what to actually do and the steps you recommend to fix this problem, but I want to keep talking about impact because sometimes it takes a while for people to be convinced, "Okay, I need to really do this," versus, "Okay, here's the ways to do this."

Matt LeMay (00:15:15):
Yeah. It has taken me until now, until writing this book to be convinced, and I still feel like I need to be convinced a little bit sometimes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):
I think the layoffs are a really good convincing function for people.

Matt LeMay (00:15:26):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):
Where they're seeing all these PMs being laid off and just, like, "How do I avoid that?" And this is basically the answer to that, is here's how you avoid getting laid off.

(00:15:33):
There's an interesting implication in what you describe here where you encourage the PM and the product team to think like the CEO.

(00:15:39):
This touches on something I've been meaning to write about, but I haven't, which is a lot of people, there's this argument are PMs the mini CEO?

(00:15:46):
In my mind, the PM is 100% the mini CEO, in terms of they think like the CE or they should within the team. They're the same; their job is to think about the business like a CEO within the team.

(00:16:03):
Obviously they're not in charge of everyone. They can't let get anyone go. The reporting lines are not the same. But I feel like that's a really good lens for the job of a PM, is just you're like the mini CEO on a team, making sure you're building the right things, thinking about the business, solving real problems that matter.

Matt LeMay (00:16:19):
I think the way I've come to think about it is that the product manager is responsible for the whole team thinking like a CEO, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:26):
I love that.

Matt LeMay (00:16:27):
So if the product manager takes that on as their sole responsibility and says, "I'm the mini CEO. I think about the business," that's a missed opportunity.

(00:16:35):
In my consulting work, it's more often than not been an engineer who's actually able to get to that specific impact-level goal for the team, sometimes before the product manager does, because the engineer is thinking in systems, is thinking about, "Okay, I know this system, I know this other system. I've had this conversation with this person. I think I see how this can all fit together."

(00:16:55):
Sometimes it's a designer or a UX researcher who understands what customers need and who has that direct firsthand knowledge.

(00:17:02):
So I think the way that I certainly initially misinterpreted the mini CEO thing was you are solely in charge of this, as opposed to you are the person who brings that kind of CEO-level commercial thinking to the team. And I've been much more inclined of late to see the product manager's job as to bring in and facilitate that conversation, rather than to be the sole owner of that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
That is a really good Nuance to what I said, and it makes all the sense in the world.

(00:17:34):
Following these lines of what is the job for product manager, you have a really nice way of just thinking about it. What does a business expect from a product manager?

Matt LeMay (00:17:42):
Yeah. My favorite definition of product management comes from Melissa Perry's book Escaping the Build Trap, where she describes product management as facilitating a value exchange.You're facilitating a value exchange between a business and its customers.

(00:17:57):
The actual shape and nature of that value exchange depends on so many things. It depends on your funding model, it depends on your business model, it depends on whether you're B2B or B2C, it depends on whether you're publicly traded or privately held. There are so many different variables that go into what a business expects from product teams.

(00:18:19):
And one thing I've come to is that I'm probably too hesitant to generalize in general, aside from that generalization I just made, but I think that the best product managers and teams I've worked with are really curious to understand what success means to their particular business.

(00:18:38):
So if that's a startup, how much runway do we have? What do we need to raise that next round? Are our investors looking for growth? Are they looking for profitability? What are they looking for in order for us to reach that next existential milestone?

(00:18:52):
If we're a publicly traded company, what are investors looking for? What have we told shareholders? What's in our next prospectus? What are we saying we're going to deliver to the market at large?

(00:19:01):
This information usually exists somewhere, but it's really easy to get disconnected from it as we go about the day-to-day work of doing product management.

(00:19:11):
I've been in a lot of rooms having workshops and sessions with teams I work with, where they're pulling up the last town hall meeting to look for slides from their CEO because they're so busy, they have so many day-to-day things to deal with, that for them that town hall day is, like, "Okay, finally I can just not have to deal with people emailing me every 10 seconds." It's a chance to take a deep breath and then get back to the stuff that really matters.

(00:19:38):
But those top-level things, those promises that have been made to the market at large, to the board, to the shareholders, those are often a great place to start for understanding what exactly your business is looking for, so you can figure out how your team's work helps contribute to success in the terms that matter most to the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
That's an amazing segue to exactly where I'd wanted to go, which is this quote that is exactly what you just said, the question you should be asking, it's kind of a different version of the one you shared earlier, which is what are we doing to contribute to the success of the business?

Matt LeMay (00:20:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):
So what is it that you think people are thinking instead most often?

Matt LeMay (00:20:21):
It's interesting. We live in a world where for the last 20 years of product development, we've been all about best practices. We love best practices.

(00:20:30):
And I love best practices too. I think best practices can be really valuable, can be really useful. I love how much knowledge sharing there is out there. When I started 15 years ago, it was so much harder to get any sense of how anybody was doing anything.

(00:20:44):
But I think the downside of this is that there are a lot of folks who are really, really fixated on doing things the right way. And a lot of the writing and thinking about doing things the right way exists in kind of this middle layer, between impact and day-to-day work.

(00:21:03):
So if you have impact, the overall success of the business, revenue, growth, profits. Then from there you set objectives and you do initiatives, and then you do bets, and then you make a strategy, and then you do your day-to-day work.

(00:21:15):
I think the tendency among a lot of product teams is to key to those middle pieces, to say, "Okay, what we're doing is on strategy. What we're doing is part of objectives. We did OKRs, right? We spent three weeks coming up with our OKRs for three months. It's OKR season, everybody. We have to pretend to care about our goals, and I read a book that says we have to have five to seven objectives with five to seven key results, and we want the score of each one to be a 0.6 or a 0.7."

(00:21:41):
And at the end of the day, you've actually spent so much time and energy being really clever and cascading these things into these intermediate steps, that each step has incurred more and more risk that we might not achieve that impact we seek to drive.

(00:21:59):
Each time we abstract things out, each time we cascade things from impact to something else until we wind up with a checklist of features to build, we're assuming that if we then build that checklist of features... We will have a successful business.

(00:22:14):
But honestly, most of the companies and teams I work with, if I ask them how their lowest-level goals add up to their highest-level goals, they look at me like I just asked them the most impossible question in the world.

(00:22:27):
Because by the time you get things down to that level, maybe it's going to work, maybe it's not going to work. There are assumptions baked into each of those levels.

(00:22:37):
You might go through the motions of doing OKRs the right way or doing strategy the right way, but that doesn't guarantee that your strategy is going to work. It doesn't mean that your OKRs are going to add up to what your investors or your shareholders need to see.

(00:22:52):
So I think there's a tendency among product teams to really sweat the middle, and to get really stressed out if the middle is not in perfect theoretical harmony with itself. If the objectives are a little out of line with the initiatives, are a little out of line with the bets, are a little out of line with the domains.

(00:23:14):
But at the end of the day, I don't think I've ever worked for a company where these things add up to a perfect breadcrumb trail you can trace back from, "We prioritized these bits of work in this sprint because it adds up to this objective, which is part of this strategy, which adds up to this initiative, which is part of this bet, which will deliver this much impact." It's just not how things work in the real world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
I feel like a lot of listeners are, like, "That sounds very familiar," exactly what you just described. Again, we're going to talk about what to change and how to make work better to actually align your teams with impact. But I want to first talk about something that follows this thread you're on, which is something you call the Low Impact PM Death Spiral. Talk about what that looks like.

Matt LeMay (00:23:55):
The Death Spiral.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):
I love the hands.

Matt LeMay (00:23:59):
The Low Impact Death Spiral is the dynamic in which every-

Matt LeMay (00:24:00):
... impact death spiral is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in one way or another. And honestly, a lot of small product companies do as well, and it goes something like this. It starts with teams taking on low impact work. Adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements because it's easier, it invites less scrutiny and you're less likely to mess up something important, right? The analogy I use sometimes is if you're working on a car, if you put your hands in the engine, you might make the car run really well or you might make it so that the car doesn't run at all. If you have the option of doing that or decking out the car with a paint job and rhinestones and making it look really, really cool, what are you going to choose to do? I know for me, I would choose the rhinestones every time because then the car runs however it runs. Whoever else is the expert in engines can fix the engine, but I'm going to do this thing which everyone can see. All the executives can look at it and say, "Wow, look at how cool this car looks," and it's not going to do any harm, right? What's the worst that could happen? We can always take the paint off.

(00:25:15):
The problem is if you have 10 teams adding rhinestones to a car, eventually the hood of the car is going to be so heavy that you can't lift it to get to the engine anymore, and that's exactly what happens in most product organizations. As you have more and more teams adding in these little features, making little enhancements, adding features, which might get some usage, but they're not going to take away anything meaningful, they're not going to mess with the commercial engine of the business. You have more folks building in and the hood of the car gets heavier and heavier, the product gets more and more complicated.

(00:25:50):
You have all these little bits that have little dependencies on each other and the product becomes as, I think most modern products are a collection of loosely connected features rather than a single guided experience. What does that mean? That means internally, building anything becomes a lot harder, right? Because there's 10 product teams that have to manage dependencies whenever you want to build something, so companies start adding program management layers. They're like, "We have too many meetings. We need to reorg for program management because reorgs fix everything and we need to make sure that we have all these layers and people are connected and we're doing dependency management." But as you add more of those things, it becomes harder and harder to do high-impact work.

(00:26:33):
The hood just gets heavier and heavier and heavier, which in turn sends teams deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of low-impact work. Low-impact work begets low-impact work. The more low-impact work you do, the harder it is to do high-impact work, the more likely you are to do low-impact work and so on and so forth. It goes and goes and goes until the next round of layoffs, and this is a real problem.

(00:27:01):
I've experienced this at again, pretty much every company I've worked with, and it's been really interesting to see how often the breaking of that cycle comes down to individual product teams being brave enough to look at their own work and look at what matters to the business and say, "You know what? We are not going to incur the risk of being a low-impact team anymore. We are going to proactively seek out high- impact work and we're going to deliver, even if it means we have to coordinate with a lot of other teams. Even if it means that suddenly the executive team takes a really big interest in the work that we're doing. We're going to see that as signs that the work we're doing matters not as things that are going to be an impediment to getting the work done."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
As you just kind of alluded to, there's a big implication here of even if you are told to build a thing that the execs are really excited about, that is low impact in your opinion, that's no excuse. You're still going to get fired eventually, even though they're telling you to build it. It sucks, but that's how it goes.

Matt LeMay (00:28:04):
It's funny, I worked with MailChimp for three years leading up to their acquisition by Intuit, when they were on this really interesting journey of going from a single product company to a platform company, which is a journey that a lot of companies are on. Where they've found success in one part of the market and they say, "You know what? We recognize that there's a value add in working more horizontally and giving people a suite of tools they can use. We want to build these tools and really make sure that we are meeting the needs of our small and medium business customers."

(00:28:34):
So I was brought on shortly after they did a reorg. They went into a domains model. They had different teams that were supposed to be experts on different parts of this marketing platform that were building in new features and their VP product, Natalia Williams, who then became their CPO, she said, "This is great that we're doing this, but I'm worried that we're going to lose sight of the commercial fundamentals. We have these teams building this really cool stuff and we've been so clear that we're excited about the teams that are working on initiative, that are building these new things, that are building out this platform, but let's make sure we stay focused on making sure that the entire platform grows in a healthy and sustainable way. And that as we are adding in these new features and functionalities, we're not making this so crowded and complicated that it's harder for people to get value out of it."

(00:29:31):
So she set a very clear goal for the product team. She wanted a specific change in the rate of users who successfully send their first email. She was like, "As we build these new things, email is still where people are coming in. We want to make sure that they can do this successfully." And she set a really ambitious goal for the entire product organization. And she put it forth to the product teams and a lot of product teams were understandably hesitant to take this on, for a number of reasons. They said, "If we mess this up, that's the entire commercial heart of the business. That's really risky."

(00:30:12):
Other ones said, "That's great, but we're building out these new parts of the platform that are really important. We don't want to risk slowing those things down." There was one product manager I worked with who really understood how important this was. She had worked on enough different parts of the app at that point. She had been on a growth team, so she really had that kind of user-centric, how do we hit the metrics we need to hit mindset? And she came to me and she was like, "I want to make sure we do this because I'm worried about what'll happen if we don't do this, right? I don't want to be on the product team that failed to deliver what matters most to the business."

(00:30:53):
So she went and worked with some user researchers and found where people were getting stuck. She did this amazing study finding where people were getting stuck before they sent that first email and she gathered together a group of product managers. I'll never forget this. I was on site in Atlanta and she gathered together a group of product managers and she was like, "Look, these are the things we need to fix if we're going to hit this, but if we fix these things, I think we can do it. I think we can get there." And there was a moment of silence where again, for totally understandable reasons, people were like, "Okay, this is great. I see it, but I'm kind of afraid that if we do this," and this product manager, I will never forget that.

(00:31:34):
She looks around the room and she says, "You know what? I'm going to haunt all of you in your dreams if you do not take this on. This is the most important thing for the business." And everyone laughed. It was a strong comment, but it was a strong comment made in really good faith that in its own way, I think acknowledged the fear that people had about taking this on. She was like, "Look, this is really important and if we work together, if we care less about the constraints and parameters and borders of our domains and care more about how we work together to deliver the thing that our leader has told us is the most important thing for the business, we can get this done."

(00:32:15):
And they did get it done, and they got it done through subtracting. They streamlined the experience. They took out steps that people were getting stuck on. They made things easier. They did the kinds of things that are rarely celebrated in the way that traditional feature launches were celebrated, but because they had this clear, impactful, specific sense of what success looks like, they were able to take on that work themselves and it made the product better, made the business better, and it was just a great moment of working with a great team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
That was an awesome example. I love just how much of a hero's journey this example is. Along those lines, it's interesting how much courage it takes to do this. Because to your point, the easy thing is just, "Okay, everyone's just telling us to do this thing. We're going to build this feature. Great, easy. I don't have to put myself out there." And what you're pointing out there is it's up to you to recognize what you're doing is not high impact and to have courage to push back and suggest something else.

Matt LeMay (00:33:15):
The funny thing is, it's courage, but it's also a kind of radical acceptance of reality. There's a very kind of emotional philosophical dimension to this conversation because I think it is in human nature to not want to be accountable for things outside of our control. Impact is not something we can just check off a list. If we're really working towards business impact, that means that there are things that might happen in the market that are going to affect us, right? Our competitors might launch something, there might be a pandemic or a war or something we didn't expect. We're reliant upon customers to change their behavior, to convert or to upgrade or to do whatever it is we hope they will do.

(00:33:58):
I use the word hope because again, we can do our best to influence that behavior, but we can't just check a box. And I think there is this very understandable human fear of being accountable for things that are beyond our control. I get that so hard, but what I think the last couple of years have shown us is that we are accountable for things outside of our control. The success of the businesses we work for is ultimately beyond our immediate control.

(00:34:26):
And you can follow all the best practices and have the highest velocity and do everything quote-unquote "right", but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to say, "Yeah, we're going out of business, but we're going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0.6 or a 0.7." That's not how it works. The reality is that things outside of our control affect us, and I think that if we can internalize that, there's a real freedom in it. The thing that surprised me most when I was researching this book is that the commercially minded PMs I interviewed were also the happiest, which I did not expect at all.

(00:35:06):
As you said, I come from a music background. I was expecting the business people to be really stressed out, and like, "I have to show up at work 92 hours a day to crush it and make sure that we hit the metrics and crush the numbers." But they were just like, "Yeah, I work for a business and I do the best I can, and then I go home. When I'm at work, my job is to help the business succeed. And I do that by understanding our business model, by trying to do work that contributes to what the business wants. In order to do that, if my goals are really impact level goals, I have to learn about our customers. I have to do discovery, I have to do all these things that we're supposed to do, not because they're abstract best practices, but because that's how you build a successful product."

(00:35:49):
And then at the end of the day, I'm not fighting my company to do product the right way, and if they can't do it the right way, I'm willing to die on this hill. It's like, " I work for a company. I don't get to make every decision. There are things outside of my control. I'll do the best I can, and I get to free up a little bit of energy to live the rest of my life."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):
To make this even less scary, hopefully, I'm curious what your answer is going to be here. Do you find that people who take this leap and push back and try to change the way their teams are thinking and what they take on, do you find that even if they fail, even if they impact wasn't there and the project fails, they're seen more favorably and their career ends up doing better and they end up doing better even if the project fails?

Matt LeMay (00:36:36):
I hope so. I'm always super, again, it's outside of my control. I can't say, if you do these things, then you will be looked upon favorably by the people who manage you because I don't know those people, and maybe they're not going to react well. Maybe they're not actually... People are not always rational, and these things don't always play out the way you hope they will. What I will say is there's a story in the book, in Impact-First Product Teams about somebody who worked for a dating app, and they were given a project to work on, which had a very specific ambitious revenue goal. And at a certain point, it became clear that they were probably not going to be able to hit this because of other things they needed to do.

(00:37:15):
So they went to the finance team and said, "Hey, we have to adjust this down." And the finance team said, "Yeah, of course you do. That makes sense. Let's adjust it down together." Would that conversation have played out the same way if they had not taken that step of saying proactively, " Based on what is happening in the broader world in the market, our product, we no longer believe we are on track to hit this, but we want to adjust so that the company at large can make better predictions and resource things accordingly"?

(00:37:42):
I don't know. But I think again, if you are embracing that mindset that there are things outside of your control and your job is to do what you can from where you sit to contribute to the success of the business, I think you're certainly doing so much more by telling the business honestly what you think is possible and what's going to happen, as opposed to stepping back from it and saying like, "Oh, well, if we talk about it, we're going to get in trouble and nobody's going to believe us." And just that simple withholding of information does its own kind of harm. So I can't guarantee any kind of outcomes. I can't say, "Yes, this will be received with generosity and grace," in all cases, but I think it's the right thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:29):
My sense is either you will be respected more highly because you are kind of solving problems for people, like higher ups that you're seeing, things that they should be seeing, and you're right, and they're like, "Oh, wow, Matt's amazing. He saw all this stuff and changed." Or you realize this is not the company for me. They don't value this. They just want me to ship this widget and that's all they want from me. I could do more somewhere else.

Matt LeMay (00:38:56):
Well, I think you touched on something really important there, which is that when you understand the business model, you understand the real world ethics and priorities of the company you work for, right? If you understand what the company's optimizing for, what they really care about, what trade-offs and sacrifices they're willing to make in order to achieve those goals, that tells you a lot more than the mission statement. Which usually sounds great, but if you follow the money, if you follow the decision-making, sometimes it paints a different picture.

(00:39:28):
And I think the more you can understand how the business model works, what that value exchange is, what value is being delivered, what value is being extracted, that I think puts you in a better position to decide, if I were to help the company achieve success, do I feel good about that? Do I feel like this is a company that if it achieves its goals has made the world a better place or not? And the more you understand the business model, the better equipped you are to make those decisions with all the information available to you, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
That's such an important point.

(00:40:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me, what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment, results, and competitive intel?

(00:40:43):
Claude can handle incredibly complex multi-step work. You can throw 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at claude.ai/lenny and using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's claude.ai/lenny.

(00:41:24):
Okay, so let's shift to talking about how to actually, what to do. This concept of actions you can take regardless of how your company operates. And that first part is really important. Something that I've seen you big on is you don't let people have an excuse for not pushing on this. And we've talked about this in other ways, but just maybe share more of just like you don't have an excuse no matter how your company operates, to not think deeply about this and try to make change.

Matt LeMay (00:41:51):
Yeah, I mean, the reality is that most companies that product managers work at aren't big tech companies. And when I worked with product teams at those companies, at insurance companies or at banks or at CPG companies, or I worked with a company a while ago that makes audio equipment, which was obviously really fun for me, the first thing they usually tell me is, "Well, we can't do product the right way because we're a regulated industry," or, "because we're B2B," or, "because we have these quarterly earnings targets we need to hit."

(00:42:22):
And that always makes me a little sad because yes, there's a way of looking at it where you can say, "All right, if these five famous companies do product management the right way, then anything that puts us in a different situation from those companies must mean that we're doing product management the wrong way," which is demoralizing and distressing, and again, leads people to these kind of quixotic battles of like, "I have to turn a bank into a search engine," which is not going to happen.

(00:42:49):
But the other way of looking at it is that those constraints are how you do product management. Those are what guides you to the commercial decisions you should be making. If you're regulated, your competitors are regulated too. If you can really understand those constraints, figure out how to work well within them, that's a huge commercial advantage for your business. If you're B2B, I honestly prefer working with B2B companies in a lot of situations because they have such immediate access to their customers and they can understand the whole system of their customers and their users and how these things connect in a way that's really immediate and actionable.

(00:43:24):
Similarly, if your company has quarterly financial targets to hit, congratulations, you know what the business really cares about. You don't have to go looking much farther than that. You don't necessarily need to cascade that 10 different levels into 45 OKRs if you can do work that you know feeds directly into what the company cares about the most.

(00:43:47):
So yes, these things are constraints, but they're the constraints that shape the work that we do. And if we embrace them as such, if we treat them as guides, not restrictions, if we say we're working with not against the commercial realities of our business, there's so much we can do. There's so much that product managers and product owners and project managers that everybody working on product at every organization can do if we again work with, not against the realities of the companies we work for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
Okay. So I think that's really empowering. You're not saying, "You need to change the way product is built at your company. It's up to you. You're an ICPM, it's up to you. No excuses." What's a simple way to describe what you're actually saying, which I think is going to make people feel a lot better?

Matt LeMay (00:44:38):
What I'm actually saying is that the things you think you're fighting against are usually the things that are giving your work shape, if you let them be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Awesome. Let's talk about, you have three steps, three handy steps to become more of an impact-first product team. So let's talk through them. What is step one?

Matt LeMay (00:44:59):
Yeah, so the first step, and I think the most important and where a lot of my work plays out is in setting team goals, close to company goals. No more than one step away from company goals. This idea comes from Christina Wodtke's book Radical Focus. She had a great episode on your podcast that I just re-watched for inspiration before I came on here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:22):
Nice move.

Matt LeMay (00:45:24):
But in that book, she has this visual where she says that most companies approach cascading OKR as kind of this multi-level, like at the top is company goals, then department goals, then big team goals, then small team goals, and smaller team goals. Which leads to the very situation I described where you can't add those small team goals back up to the company goals. She has a visual that she compares that to, which is the company goal as a center of gravity, and then every other team goal orbiting one level around it. And this blew my mind when I saw it for the first time, because whether you're doing OKRs or KPIs or north star metrics, whatever framework you're ostensibly using, if you use it well, it looks like that.

(00:46:09):
I worked with a team a while ago that was a traditional feature team at a FinTech company. They were the team that was kind of like the team I worked with at MailChimp, kind of given new features to build to take this product and build it more into a multi-product platform. And the business would say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate, they'd say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate. And then the business said, "Okay, we're going to do things a little bit differently. Now we have this top line revenue target. We want to make this much more money next year, and we want you to tell us how you're going to contribute to this."

(00:46:42):
And this was a really challenging conversation for this team because as much as people complain about being feature factories, again, it feels safer, right? There's more control over that. If you're told what to build, you have a lot more control over whether or not you build it than you do over whether or not it generates revenue. So we started having this conversation, what framework should we use? How should we do this? And I was not asking very good questions. I was kind of panicking too, to be honest. And then I asked them, I was like, "Okay, why does this team exist, right? Why are we doing this at all? Why is the business investing in this big team to build all these features? Why do we care if we're a single-product company or a multi-product platform company?"

(00:47:26):
And one of the team leaders said, "Oh, well actually, the customer lifetime value of a multi-product user is much higher than that of a single-product user." I was like, "Oh, do we know how much higher?" And they said, "Yeah, we actually have a number on that." And I was like, "Wow. So if we had a goal of converting a certain number of single-product users to multi-product users, we know exactly how much revenue is on the line." They were like, "Yeah, I guess so." So we were able to set a goal, and from there we had this conversation about what's the number we would need to hit to make this team feel like a good investment? And we came to a specific number and-

Matt LeMay (00:48:00):
To make this team feel like a good investment. And we came to a specific number and that number informed every decision that was made by that team for the rest of the year. We said, "By the end of the year, we need to convert this many single product users to multi-product users because if we do that, there's this much additional revenue which contributes this much to the company's top line revenue goal." It's one step away.

(00:48:22):
And when they went and shared that goal with company leadership, they got it right away. They didn't have to say, "Well, why is this valuable?" They didn't have to say, "What are your other OKRs? Show us the deck." They got it. And that gave them so much leeway to make bolder decisions, to work more closely with other teams to ask for the resources they needed. And that process of arriving at that goal, that goal that is impactful and specific and one step away from what the company cares about the most, is probably the most valuable way I have spent my time with teams of late. Because once you get to that, you see how everything else flows from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:01):
And the implication here is that if it's too far away from people understanding what the hell are you guys even doing to help the business? That's the problem you want to avoid.

Matt LeMay (00:49:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):
So one extreme is, I don't know, it probably doesn't make sense for your team to have exactly the same goal as the company. Say your company's trying to grow a hundred million revenue rate, that's not going to be your team's goal. So it's almost like that extreme is what's one step away from that? What's your contribution to that company goal?

(00:49:29):
The other end is just some 10 level deep, we're going to improve conversion of this random step, which is going to grow this thing which grows that, and then that grows revenue.

Matt LeMay (00:49:37):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:38):
What is your guidance on revenue-based goals as goals for teams?

Matt LeMay (00:49:43):
I think, again, it depends. I know people have very strong opinions about teams should always or should never have revenue-based goals. I don't think it's that simple. I think sometimes yes, if your company is working towards revenue, having a revenue-based goal makes sense, or at least being able to put some value in terms of revenue on the work that your team is doing. I've worked with some startups where they actively are not going after revenue because right now the name of the game is growth, right? They want to show that they have enough users to raise that next round of investment. I actually worked with one startup where their revenue was going up, and their number of users was going up, and we had to have a really interesting conversation around which one actually matters to our investors. And we kind of wound up developing these two scenarios, the high growth scenario and the low growth scenario.

(00:50:33):
And talking to the product team, it was really clear that there was no way they were going to hit the high growth scenario. So they pivoted to focus on profitability so they could build more runway and raise that next round as a smaller business with a sustainable revenue base.

(00:50:46):
So I get why people are hesitant to commit to revenue goals. I think that there are certainly situations where revenue goals would be too broad or not exactly what the business needs, but at the end of the day, money is how the impact of most teams is going to be measured. And if you don't have a point of view on why your team is a good investment, either in the money return it brings, or in another return that is equally or more important to the business, then again, that feels like a tenuous and risky position to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:25):
To kind of get people's brains noodling in the right direction. What are some examples of good goals, like specific goals that your teams have set that are one step away from a company goal? What are just some examples without naming companies?

Matt LeMay (00:51:38):
I have a story to tell to that effect, which also sets up the second step here, which is to keep impact first at every step.

(00:51:47):
So, I worked with a growth team at a tech company that is beloved by many the people. And I was brought on to help them set OKRs, right? The company was doing OKRs across the board, and this team was going to set its growth OKRs. So they had done a lot of reading, a lot of research into how to do OKRs the right way. They had read, unfortunately, they had not read Radical Focus or they hopefully would've done things differently, they had read a lot of other books. They had printed out a lot of articles and they said, "We're going to make sure we get this right. We're going to put together a slide deck that has five to seven objectives with five to seven key results each, and each key result is going to have an owner and we're going to make sure that people are accountable for it. And we're going to really, really do this the right way. We're going to get that middle piece perfect."

(00:52:39):
So they spent a long time working on these OKRs, OKR season ends. They file away the OKR deck not to be seen until the next OKR season. We reconvene, and spend a whole day scoring all of the OKRs. And there are heated conversations about what's a 0.6 versus a 0.7? Is this a 0.9? Who really should be the owner of this key result? Who contributed the most to it? And we get through this whole conversation, everyone's tired. And I'm like, "There's just one question I need to ask. I'm so sorry to do this to y'all, but how does this all add up to the company level growth goals?"

(00:53:23):
People look around and they're like, "Well, that wasn't what we did. We set our team level OKRs and we went through the process and we made sure, and we followed the OKRs, we thought about the OKRs," and I said, "Yeah, but the company has a goal of let's call it bringing on a million new users in this year. We're a growth team. How many users did we bring on?"

(00:53:50):
And there's a moment of silence. And the leader of this team's a really, really good leader. She stands and she's like, "Okay, we're going to do things differently." She steps up to the whiteboard, puts 1 million on the right end of the whiteboard, draws a line, "This is the year," draws a little tick on the line. "This is where we are now. It's a smaller number than a million. This is where we need to get to. If our conversation doesn't start with this, I don't want to have the conversation. And if you are 51% sure that a different approach is going to get us 1% closer, I expect you to advocate for that approach. And this is now how we are going to do everything."

(00:54:34):
And I think about that all the time, because it's subtracting steps. It's making things less complicated. It actually is doing exactly what you described. It's saying, "This is what the company cares about. We're the growth team. We need to figure out how everything we're doing contributes to this."

(00:54:55):
That story really stuck with me because it seems like it should be obvious, right? If you're the growth team at a company with a growth goal, obviously that's going to be something you care about. But it's so easy in the day-to-day work of setting these intermediate goals, of doing strategy, of doing the things we do to make things just a little bit more complicated than they need to be. So for this particular team and this particular moment, a good goal was looking at the company level goal and saying, "If we're the team that's driving growth, we're accountable for this. We're going to step up and we're going to do everything we can to make sure, the company meets its ambition."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):
And it's so obvious if you come at it from the perspective you shared earlier. If you're the CEO, would you fund this team? If you see our goal is a million users, this team will drive us a hundred thousand users. Assuming that's a lot for you. Obviously we want that team to do great and we're going to give them the resources to do that. They're going to contribute meaningfully to this goal. It's very obvious as you see it. The trick is a lot of people think they're doing that and they're not. Maybe one heuristic I think about as you're talking is just like, how do you know if you're doing this? There should be a very simple spreadsheet formula of just here's the company goal, here's your goal. There should be one simple formula that translates up that adds to it.

Matt LeMay (00:56:20):
One Y statement and or one mathematical operator is usually the way I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:24):
There we go.

Matt LeMay (00:56:26):
In some cases, like the story I told about that FinTech company, it's something like upgraded users. That's one step, right? You multiply that by the increased customer lifetime value. In some cases, it's a smaller unit of the same thing. So it's a subset of the revenue or growth that the company's trying to deliver.

(00:56:47):
I worked with a company recently that had a team rebuilding their ad tech platform. This is a big company that does a lot of different things, and at the heart of all of their different offerings is this ad tech platform. And I was brought on to do a day long workshop with this company because this was a really important team and they were struggling to figure out what success looked like.

(00:57:06):
So I said, "Okay, what are your goals?" And they said, "Here's the deck with our goals." I said, "That's a lot of goals. I wouldn't be able to make decisions with those goals." They said, "Oh wait, wait, wait, no, we also have a Miro board. We went through this and we decided the deck was too much. So we also have a Miro board," but as Miro boards tend to do, it kind of grew and grew and grew in all directions. So now it's a big board. Turned out they had two Miro boards because they had tried to do this twice.

(00:57:33):
So we sat down and we did this really interesting kind of subtractive exercise, where everybody got a post-it note to write down what they think the most important goal of the team is. And then they would pair up and they would have to make it smaller each time, make it more concise. If there were two things, get it down to one thing. If there were 10 words, bring it down to eight words, make it smaller and more concise each time.

(00:57:56):
And we came up with two options. One was build a fantastic, wonderful, magical, beautiful platform to increase our team's profits by 20%. Fair enough. The other one was, build a stupendous, wonderful, fantastic platform to increase our team's profits in the next financial year from 20 million pounds to a hundred million pounds.

(00:58:18):
And I'm looking at these and I'm like, "Okay, so we know that there is an expectation of revenue here. There's an expectation that we will drive profitability, but one of these is 20% and the other is 500%. Where do these numbers come from?" And the folks who had said 20%, they were like, "That feels like a good return." And what's interesting was when I was telling the story, when I was giving some talks recently, and people would kind of laugh like, "Oh, they named the wrong number." But they were so brave to do that, and them saying 20% is what actually unlocked the conversation at the team level, because somebody else in the room heard that and said, "Wait, I do remember something about profits. There was some target we were supposed to hit, but I think I remember it being a lot bigger than that." And they actually went back and found a town hall that their VP had given and buried in a slide in that town hall was this hundred million pound profit target by the end of the next financial year.

(00:59:22):
So they have this number and they start to go like, "Oh gosh, that's a lot, but it's a whole financial year. It'll be fine." And we do, again, inspired by that leader I worked with, I just put this out on a whiteboard. I'm like, "All right, a hundred million in profits by the end of the next financial year right now we're here. What else should be on this timeline?" Somebody said, "Well, we're launching this in October." So I put October up there. I go, "Okay, so if we don't ship anything until October, and right now it's March, how much profit do we make until?" And they said, "About 10 million." I'm like, "Okay. So that means that between October and March, we need to generate 90 million pounds of profits."

(01:00:06):
And this team, I was worried they were going to freak out or they were going to be like, "Oh, we can't do this. It's impossible." But they were like, "Okay, it's time to step up. It's time to do all these things that we need to do. We need to ship sooner. We need to do more validation. We need to do more testing. Can we commercialize things sooner? Can we do more discovery to make sure that this is really going to have the impact we need to have? Why are we doing this whole big relaunch? Why don't we rebuild individual things? What impact will we have if we brought more people in top of funnel now? Can we begin building our user base and then upgrade that user base? What are the trade-offs if we do that versus if we bring people in?"

(01:00:41):
All those things that I think is really the heart and the intent of these best practices. They came to life because this team had clarity. They understood like, "Okay, we are accountable for something which is specific enough to drive some real urgency, and which is impactful enough that we have to get out there and do all these things that we're supposed to do."

(01:01:05):
So that to me, is a really good example of how if you start with this question of like, well, what's expected of this team? What does success look like for us? It'll often lead you to the right neighborhood of what kind of unit of measure you want to look for, how the business is going to look to you, whether they're looking directly at revenue, whether they're looking at something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:29):
Okay. These stories are awesome. So basically, so far, the two steps that you've illustrated here of doing this correctly, step one is set team goals that are close to company goals. And then step two is, do this at every step of the product building process. It's not just a one-time thing at the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:01:46):
Right. As you're doing OKRs, like that team I talked about, when you're thinking about your company strategy, when you're writing epics, whatever it is, keep that impactful goal top of mind. Don't let it slip away. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):
Because to your point, the examples you shared where you think you're just like, "Cool, we have our goal, let's go." And then you spend months doing this thing and then you forget, okay, this actually got disconnected from the company goal.

Matt LeMay (01:02:12):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Everything you've worked hard to do is just, no one cares.

Matt LeMay (01:02:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Okay. What is step three?

Matt LeMay (01:02:18):
Step three is to connect every bit of work back to impact. So this is when we get to the prioritization piece, right.

(01:02:26):
So impact estimation is something that is written about quite well, quite extensively in product management stuff, but it's something that it's easy to not do. I work with a lot of teams that want to know, again, the right best practice for doing prioritization, whether that's should we use ICE or RICE or MoSCoW or whatever it is, what's the right way to do prioritization? And again, it depends, but if you don't have a clear and specific sense of what impact means, you can't really prioritize effectively. So this is where, again, everything comes back to that first step of the way you set goals.

(01:03:13):
So that team I told you about that had the goal of converting single product users to multi-product users, one of the product managers on that team came back to me a few months later and said, "Hey, Matt, I could really use your help figuring out how to do prioritization. Should we do ICE? Should we do RICE? Should we do MoSCoW? I put together an ICE matrix where I scored impact and I scored certainty and I scored effort, and I multiplied each one by each one, and I have a list of the things we should do."

(01:03:38):
And I said, "That's awesome." And I do really think it's awesome when people take the initiative to do the thing to say, "I put this together, let's walk through it." So when they showed me this, I said, "Let's start with impact." They're like, "Okay, well here's the score for each one." I was like, "What's the score?" They're like, "Oh, it's a lot of different things." And I said, "Okay, well, we have a team goal of a certain specific number of users we need to convert by the end of the year, so let's try to express impact as a function of that goal. So rather than an abstract score, what is the most number of users we could convert in each of these different scenarios?"

(01:04:18):
And understandably, they were kind of like, "Oh, you know what? I don't know exactly." I'm like, "Let's, just work through it. We don't have to be precise. It's called impact estimation, not impact getting perfect number." So for one of them, they were like, "Well, we can do this landing page." I'm like, "Okay, well how many people hit the landing page?" And they were like, "Not that many, maybe a few hundred." I'm like, "Okay, cool. So that's maybe a few hundred."

(01:04:43):
And there was one thing which they were really reluctant. It had a high effort score and a medium certainty score. And what they basically said was like, "Look, if we really wanted to do this, we could redesign the entire onboarding experience. We can make it so that rather than us trying to retroactively shuttle people into multi-product usage, we can understand them when they join and get them into the right category of user right away."

(01:05:08):
I'm like, "That sounds amazing." What's the most impact that could have? They were like, "It would get us all the way there if we did it right, but we'd have to work with these other teams and we'd have to work with marketing. And there are so many dependencies and so many things outside of our control that we don't know if we could do it." And I said, "That's okay. These are the trade-offs we make as product managers, you will have some things to work on that are going to have less impact, but might be easier and more certain to deliver. But if this thing could get us all the way there, if it's really the only thing we're looking at, which has really any chance of getting us to our goal, which remember we came up with to answer the question, what does this team need to deliver to be a good investment for the business, then I think it's worth going for it.

(01:05:55):
"It's worth having those conversations with other product teams. It's worth talking to folks in marketing. It's worth stretching ourselves a little bit and saying, 'This is going to be challenging to do, but if we can do it, we can really deliver on something which we're going to feel great about.'"

(01:06:11):
So the way that third step manifests itself the most frequently, tactically is are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest and we're saying, "Does this actually have a chance of contributing?" Whereas again, if we get really clever and we come up with a proprietary scoring system and all these little intermediate steps, we can feel like we're doing really awesome work and being very, very terribly smart. But we again, run the risk that we are going to lose our connection with why we're setting about to do this work in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):
Such an important and often easily overlooked point. This idea that when you're doing RICE or whatever version of ICE that you do, that impact should be based on impact to your goal, which is one level removed from the company goal. It feels so obvious as you talk about it, and I hope most people know this, but I feel like that's something people forget. Just like, what is impact? Oh yeah, customers will be happier.

Matt LeMay (01:07:16):
Again, this is not easy work, right? Working in product means that we have so many different perspectives, so many different folks who have so many different priorities. The stakeholder management piece of this is relentless and exhausting, and it's really, really easy to lose sight of this stuff. And it takes work and discipline and as you said, bravery to keep bringing it back. But I think again, it is not only the right thing to do, but it helps you at the end of the day, have a little bit more of a boundary between the work you're doing at your job and the stuff you're good at in your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):
Speaking of boundaries, a lot of the advice you share will involve people saying no, and pushing back, and convincing people they're wrong, which is very hard. That's not a natural happy place for most people.

Matt LeMay (01:08:12):
Nope.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):
What advice do you have? What have you learned works well for pushing back, helping people see how they're not... What they want you to build is wrong.

Matt LeMay (01:08:24):
So this is where I have the benefit, I suppose, of being a conflict-averse, people pleaser. So I've been through this, and I think the thing I am proudest of saying in product management and practice is that if you're doing product management really well, you never have to say yes and you never have to say no. You're giving people options and you're helping them understand the trade-offs.

(01:08:52):
So in keeping with this idea that there are things outside of your control, as a product manager, you're not always going to be the one who makes the decision. There are going to be other people who come to you and say, "Build this," or who say, "I don't see the value in that. Do this, do that. I want this, I want that." If those people are in a position of formal authority in the organization, I've certainly never had luck telling them no.

(01:09:16):
Furthermore, I've found myself in situations where they just know things that I don't know. Where they're pursuing an acquisition, so there are certain things that we have to do or can't do. Where there's some serious financial challenge that they're working their way through right now, which is shifting around priorities, but they are not at liberty to discuss that with the broader organization. It is quite possible that the folks who are asking you to do things that don't make sense, have access to information that you don't. And that in trying to convince them otherwise, you are not only going to fail, but you are going to lose some of that trust and degrade that relationship that could in time be really important for you. So I think the challenge is to say, "All right, you want me to build this thing? Maybe. Let's look at the different things."

(01:10:15):
If you're going through these steps, if you say, "I understand, here's what our team's goals are, here's the stuff we're prioritizing, here's the impact we think it could have." If you're coming to me with something which is going to have more impact, heck yeah, I would love to build that. That sounds amazing.

(01:10:29):
But if it has an unclear impact or if it doesn't tie into this, then we might need to adjust the impact we're seeking to have. If this is suddenly really important, as with that story that was told in the book, right? Sometimes it's like, all right, we got to do this. Sure. That means that our impact projection is going to have to be adjusted this much.

(01:10:48):
You're not saying no, you're not saying yes. You're helping someone who is in a position to make a decision, understand the trade-offs that go into that decision. And again, if you can do that, you're going to go home at the end of the day feeling better. You're going to feel less like you lost a battle or that you were overridden by an unjust tyrant, and it's going to be more like, "Okay, I made sure they had all the information I would want to have if I were making that decision. That decision is ultimately theirs to make, and I'm going to do the best I can."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):
Tell me if you disagree. In my experience, you also want to recommend a path. Because a lot of people don't want PMs just, "Here's all the options. I have no opinion, no bias of any kind. You decide." I find that people want you to have a perspective.

Matt LeMay (01:11:33):
Absolutely. Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula. I did when I was working with MailChimp, we actually did a workshop with all the product managers at the company where we had people roleplay trying to sell in a single option versus multiple options with a recommendation. And it was amazing how when you present a single option, people's instinct is just to, well, I don't know, you start poking holes in it. Not because you're a jerk, but because-

Matt LeMay (01:12:00):
You start poking holes in it, not because you're a jerk, but because you're looking at one thing and you're like, "Oh, well, what about this? What about that?"

(01:12:07):
Again, all of your own anxieties and fears and the things that you don't feel represented in there, and where you're worried, "What if this happens? What if that happens?"

(01:12:14):
All of that kind of detracts from the momentum, whereas if you come in and say, "Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend," then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer and stronger.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):
I feel like people might miss that nuance, in the way we talked about it, so I think that's a really important point to make there.

(01:12:35):
Let me come back to the three steps, just for folks that are, "Cool, I'm excited, I'm motivated. I'm going to change the way we operate." I'll summarize real quick.

(01:12:44):
So step one is, set team goals close to company goals. Step two is keep impact first at every step. Don't forget, as you're building throughout the year. And then, step three is connect every bit of work back to impact.

Matt LeMay (01:12:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):
I think, again, it's important to remind people, this may be hard and annoying, and maybe things are going fine. Everyone's telling you what to build, you're building and shipping, and things are, it seems to be going all right.

(01:13:11):
I think an important part of this is just, if you believe what you're building is not helping the business grow and succeed, either, they'll let you go someday, because you're not doing something that matters. Or the business will not work out, and you'll be in trouble.

(01:13:27):
So it's like, even if you don't want to do this something, you need to really seriously think about this, even though it's really hard.

Matt LeMay (01:13:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
But maybe let me just think of that a little bit. Say the business is doing great, everything's great. The CEO's telling you all the things to build, that sales guys and girls are just like, "Here, ship these features, everything's great."

(01:13:46):
And everything's working, business is growing. What thoughts there? Is it just, "Nah, leave it alone?" Or is your sense, "Okay, most often this will not last," and you should really start to work on these skills?

Matt LeMay (01:13:56):
It's funny, the teams I've worked with, when things are going well, are sometimes just as anxious as the teams I've worked with, when things are going poorly, because they have a hard time attributing success to what they're doing, right?

(01:14:08):
They'll look at it and they'll say, "Yeah, we're doing great. But I think that honestly has more to do with marketing than it does with us."

(01:14:14):
Or, "Yeah, we're doing great, but we're just in the right place at the right time. Our business is doing really well, our sector is doing really well. We're just growing along with everyone else who's growing."

(01:14:24):
And I think, as with most things, if you approach it with curiosity, there's a lot to learn from it. So if you look at it, and you say, "Yeah, we can't necessarily take sole credit for this, but Marketing's doing awesome. Let's talk to them. What are they doing? Why is this going so well? What have they learned from this, that we can work with them more closely?"

(01:14:46):
If your sector is just doing really well, be like, okay, well what about this is working right now? What might change in the future? How can we understand this?"

(01:14:54):
So I think the challenge, when things are going well, is to keep that curiosity going, and to keep celebrating the things, not just that your team is doing, but that everyone is doing, and to take that time, where you have a little bit more leeway, where there's less pressure on you in the moment, to build those connections with other parts of the organization, to see where that really good work is happening.

(01:15:21):
One thing that makes me sad is when teams look upon each other with envy and disgust, right, when it's, "This team's doing, they're doing great work, but they're not held to the same standards that we are, and it's not fair, and they're the team that everyone likes."

(01:15:37):
It's like, "Go talk to them, because there's probably something you can learn from them. And if they're the team that's getting positive attention, that's doing meaningful work, there's probably a reason for that. And if you can understand that reason, and you can align your work, that team's work, that's probably going to be really good for you."

(01:15:58):
Again, I think, in a lot of cases, it comes back down to that control thing, right? If we can't feel a sense of control over, "Things are going well because we did this," we tend to disconnect ourselves from things going well and say, "Well, I can't. It almost feels dangerous to engage with it because, what if we didn't do anything, but good things are still happening."

(01:16:21):
And I think, just keeping that openness, keeping that curiosity going, puts you in a much better position for when things inevitably begin to either plateau or decline, which is the cyclical nature of all things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):
Wow. Profound there. To start to wrap up our conversation, what's maybe one question from the book, or even from this conversation, that you think product leaders, product teams should ask themselves to help them solve problems, that maybe they're not seeing, and to help their team operate better?

Matt LeMay (01:16:53):
I mean, I love the, "Would you fund this team, if you were the CEO question?" I know that that can feel a little confrontational sometimes. So, a gentler way of bringing that up is to say, "What's one sentence you'd want to be able to say at the end of this year, that would leave you feeling awesome about this team's work? What's something?"

(01:17:11):
At the end of the year, everything went really well for this team. You run into the CEO in the hallway, and you say, "I feel awesome, because we did this." '.

(01:17:20):
And you'll sometimes get very different answers from different people on the team, building on those answers, saying, "Okay, this is what you care about. This is what I care about. This is what I'm worried about. This is what I'm excited about."

(01:17:33):
That's how you get that magical, people in a room building together, or musicians in a room writing their next song, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
What a call, back to the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:17:40):
And then-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
I love this.

Matt LeMay (01:17:43):
It's getting that conversation out in the open, and getting people to talk about their perspectives and their expectations, with the goal of bringing it together, to create something better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):
Bam. Matt, is there anything else that you wanted to cover or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Matt LeMay (01:18:03):
I think we covered it. I just leave people with, again, this hope that you can start to see the commercial realities and constraints of your business as opportunities, as guideposts, as things that shape and structure your work, not as things that you single-handedly need to change, or break down, or transform, because you probably can't. And that's okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):
That's empowering stuff. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Matt LeMay (01:18:37):
As ready as I'm going to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:39):
Question one. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Matt LeMay (01:18:43):
Radical Focus, by Christina Wodtke, is obviously, I cite it a lot in my book, I think it's the best book about OKRs. I love her style of writing. I love the way she tells stories.

(01:18:56):
I love the focus on focus, this idea that again, the way you do it is less important than the result of the way of doing it. I just find that so inspiring, always.

(01:19:08):
The other book, this is a bit of a curveball, is by Alan Watts, the Buddhist philosopher. It's called The Wisdom of Insecurity. And a lot of the way I talk about control, and giving up control, comes from that book.

(01:19:23):
It also has a concept. It opens with a concept called the law of reverse effort, which is that sometimes, the harder you try, the worse you make things. When it comes to setting goals, doing OKRs, doing strategy, I think about this a lot, that there is a tendency sometimes to put effort towards the overcomplication of things, which in turn makes those things less effective, what they're ultimately intended to achieve. So, highly recommend that book. It helped me a lot through some dark times, mentally.

(01:19:59):
There's an idea in the book. He talks about how trying to keep yourself perpetually safe in an imagined future is effectively killing yourself to the present. And ooh, that hit hard. That hit me really, really, really hard. So, highly recommend that book.

(01:20:18):
If the things we've talked about today make you even a fraction of, as anxious and fearful as they make me when I navigate them in my work, then I highly recommend The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:32):
I was going to ask what the title is, because that sounds really powerful. Amazing, amazing pick.

(01:20:37):
Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Matt LeMay (01:20:41):
God. So especially, when I'm in work-y write-y mode, my brain shuts off to all things that are not trash. So I have been watching a lot of trash.

(01:20:53):
I watched Temptation Island, the new season of Temptation Island on Netflix. I loved it so much. It's Mark L. Wahlberg, who is the host of Antiques Roadshow, just weaponizing therapyspeak to torture people, in this bizarre scenario.

(01:21:15):
And I should not love it, but I am only a human, and a messy bitch who lives for the drama, sometimes, so ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):
So good.

Matt LeMay (01:21:26):
I know. I enjoyed that very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:27):
I think it's the first Temptation Island call-out, and I love it. Okay, favorite product or ... Yeah, favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?

Matt LeMay (01:21:37):
Yeah, so I'm really glad you asked this question, because as a musician, I live in this world of niche products, which is so much fun, because the economies of scale for music creators are just totally different, right?

(01:21:48):
You don't need to build a product that's going to have a billion users, and create a huge return. You can do something that a few hundred or a few thousand people get a lot of use out of and love. You're in this fun realm of hybrid, physical and digital, and different types of things. And when you asked me this question, the first thing that came to mind was this, which is made by an amplifier builder who goes by Milkman Sound, in the San Francisco Bay area, who took, basically, the circuit of a Fender amplifier, and made a version of it that fits into this handy, compact, lightweight form factor.

(01:22:35):
So for me, as somebody who is no longer 22 years old, and still occasionally tours with my friend's band, and has back problems, the fact that I can carry this really powerful amplifier around, in this really well-designed, aesthetically pleasing form factor, just feels like such a joy. It's one of those products that really understands what quality means to its particular audience.

(01:23:09):
And I can go on tour, and have things sound really nice, without having to lug a giant, heavy thing. And I love that. It's something for which I am truly grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):
This makes me want to play music randomly, but just so I understand how this works, do you still plug that into a speaker, or is that-

Matt LeMay (01:23:30):
Yeah, so I have a little speaker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:32):
Okay. Oh, okay.

Matt LeMay (01:23:32):
You can also plug direct into the soundboard at a club, or for recording.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:36):
Okay, got it.

Matt LeMay (01:23:37):
And it has a little headphone jack, too. So if I want to practice in the hotel room, before you play, I can also use this.

(01:23:45):
It does everything you would need this device to do, and nothing more, and it does it really well. And that is so delicious to me, to have a product-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Another great pick.

Matt LeMay (01:24:01):
... that I'm like, "This does exactly what I need. It does it so well, and it's a delightful product."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:11):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work, or in life?

Matt LeMay (01:24:17):
I come back to something my mom told me. I'm sure you've experienced this, too. When you're a person creating things in the world, there's a tendency to look at the numbers, and look at, "How am I doing? And did this resonate? Is this good? Did this work?"

(01:24:31):
And I've definitely worked on things, especially in my musical life, where the amount of effort and love, and time and care that went into something, didn't feel like it showed up in the result of that thing, or the way it was received.

(01:24:48):
I was talking to my mom about this once, and she said, "I really believe that no good work is wasted. Even if you don't see it right away, when you put good work out into the world, even if it only finds a few people, it's never wasted. If you do work you really believe in, it's going to have some positive effect on the world."

(01:25:10):
And that really stuck with me. I've carried that with me, even when I think about how to write, and what to say, and when I start to worry about outsmarting myself, and should I be more strategic in the way I message this, and should I say something I don't really totally believe?

(01:25:34):
There've been a few times, not recently, but a few times, 10 years ago, where I dabbled in writing click bait-y headlines, because I was like, "Ooh, is this going to get more attention?" And there was one in particular, that got really thoughtful critique from some people I really respect.

(01:25:49):
I was like, "I don't want to do this. I don't want to put work I don't believe in out into the world," and even if it doesn't do what I hoped it would do, I'm going to go forth with the belief that no good work has wasted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:03):
I totally believe that. Final question. You wrote a ton of music reviews over the years. I'm curious if there's one that was just very, people super disagreed with it, or just one that you're super proud of?

Matt LeMay (01:26:19):
I mean, I am a villain, in certain corners of the internet-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):
Say more.

Matt LeMay (01:26:23):
... for the review I wrote of Liz Phair's self-titled album. I wrote this review when I was 19, when my worldview was toxic, and very much in progress. It was a really condescending, arrogant review, written from a place of unearned condescension and arrogance.

(01:26:46):
Not that condescension and arrogance should necessarily be earned, but it felt righteous at the time, in a way that is dangerous, right? That toxic righteousness where you're like, "I'm fighting something bad." But then you realize that what you're fighting is not actually bad.

(01:27:09):
You're actually punching sideways and down, but you don't have the wherewithal and the maturity to realize that you are not where you think you are, in relation to people and culture, and yourself. So I apologized for that review in 2019, and Liz Phair and I actually had a really nice little Twitter back and forth.

(01:27:34):
This was back when Twitter was still a place where this kind of thing could happen, and it was nice to wrap that up in that way. I still don't feel good about it, because it was playing into some really toxic and hurtful dimensions of discourse.

(01:28:06):
But what can you do, if not look back on it and say, "Yeah, I was wrong. I was just flat-out wrong, and beyond being wrong, I was being a jerk." Somebody posted this, a meme creator on Instagram, posted that review a couple months ago, with a caption, " Matt LeMay, you will be dealt with."

(01:28:31):
And I was like, "Yeah, yeah. If I read that now, I would probably say something pretty similar." So I think, as I said, I'm a conflict averse people pleaser.

(01:28:48):
I went through my kind of edgelord phase. And I don't think it did any good for me, or for anyone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
Wow. That was a much more profound answer than I expected. I can't believe people are still referencing this review from a long time ago. How many years? How ...

Matt LeMay (01:29:08):
22? It was 2003, so it was 22 years ago. It was more than half my life ago. But this is the wild thing, is that on the internet, it still looks new.

(01:29:19):
The first talk I ever gave, in London, actually, was at a Red Monk event, and I brought my teenage diary with me, to make the point that if something has 10 years of age on it as paper, it's contextualized by its own material existence, right?

(01:29:36):
But somebody will go, "Oh, I wonder what Pitchfork thought of this record," they'll see my jerk-ass review, and be, "Pitchfork published this jerk-ass review. Who was the jerk-ass reviewer who wrote it?"

(01:29:48):
And they'll find me, and be like, "Hey, you, you're a jerk-ass, because you wrote this jerk-ass review." And I'll be like, "Yes, I did write that jerk-ass review, from the place of being a jerk-ass." But I like to think I am a person who has lived 22 years of life since then.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:11):
Your frontal cortex has developed more since then. I think it doesn't stop-

Matt LeMay (01:30:13):
God, I hope so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:14):
Until 25, 26. Matt, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to, and more.

(01:30:22):
Two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online, talk about the sort of work you do with companies, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt LeMay (01:30:29):
Yeah, so you can find me online at matlemay.com, pretty straightforward, and in terms of how folks can be useful to me, hopefully I can be useful to them, whether that's through the books, or through coming into work with your company, and help your teams focus.

(01:30:47):
I find that facilitating these conversations is a really big value add. It's hard to have these conversations to do this without some outside help sometimes. So again, whether it's in book form or in me form, I hope that I can be useful to you, and having these conversations in a way that's less scary, more accessible, and leads you down that road to doing impactful work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):
Awesome, and mattlemay.com. And then, what's the name of the book? Where do they find it

Matt LeMay (01:31:15):
Impact-First Product Teams. You can find it at all the places where you find books, on Amazon. There's an author read audiobook, which I recorded right here in this room, with this microphone. I did all the musical interludes myself ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:28):
Why?

Matt LeMay (01:31:30):
Because it was a great way to procrastinate, when I did not actually want to read the book. But I hope you will find it fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:39):
Matt, thank you so much for being here.

Matt LeMay (01:31:41):
Thanks so much, Lenny. This was great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):

# "I deliberately understaff every project" | Leadership lessons from Rippling's $16B journey

## Transcript

Matt MacInnis (00:00:00):
It is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company. If you overstaff, you get politics, you get people working on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. That is poison. It's wasteful. It slows you down. It creates cruft.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You've been a long time COO at Rippling. Recently, you moved into CPO, Chief Product Officer at Rippling. Something you talk a lot about is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts.

Matt MacInnis (00:00:26):
If you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult. You got to sort of remind people that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. It's supposed to be really fricking exhausting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
You're a big fan of escalating issues.

Matt MacInnis (00:00:41):
Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. When you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable. Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort, and it's fundamentally selfish. So many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well. Teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes. The purest form of ambition and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO. Every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity. That is fucking dangerous.

(00:01:17):
As an executive, as a leader, your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level. You've had a couple really interesting experiences with your own startup. We talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Matt MacInnis, Chief Product Officer and formerly longtime Chief Operating Officer at Rippling. If you don't know much about Rippling, it's a massively successful business last valued at over $16 billion. They have over 5,000 employees, and Matt has been instrumental to that success. He's also got a really rare combination of brutal honesty, a ton of experience building a very complex and very successful business, and being able to clearly articulate what he has learned really well. Matt shared a lot of insights and advice that I've not heard anyone else on this podcast share, and I left this conversation feeling that every leader needs to hear his advice.

(00:02:12):

Amar (00:02:48):
This podcast is sponsored by Google. Hey folks, I'm Amar, product and design lead at Google DeepMind. Have you ever wanted to build an app for yourself, your friends, or finally launch that side project you've been dreaming about? Now you can bring any idea to life, no coding background required with Gemini three in Google AI Studio. It's called vibe coding and we're making it dead simple. Just describe your app and Gemini will wire up the right models for you so you can focus on your creative vision. Head to ai.studio/build to create your first app.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:18):
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Eppo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction, and business impact. It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works.

(00:03:56):
I saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong. And the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Eppo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with heat maps and scroll maps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster, fix smarter, and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com/lenny. That's datadoghq.com/lenny.

(00:04:43):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me. I want to start with something that I know is really important to you, something you talk a lot about that I don't think people hear enough on podcasts like this, which is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts. Talk about why this is so important, what you think people need to hear.

Matt MacInnis (00:05:04):
This is a term, that phrasing I actually attribute to a friend of mine, Dan Gill, who's the chief product officer at Carvana, which as a company also doesn't get enough credit for how much of a tech company it actually is. Super interesting. And I think as a general framework for me, and a lot of what I say with you today is not really specific to product in any way. We should actually talk about that. It's like the product function is an instantiation of the general concept of management. Being a chief product officer is not that different from being a chief whatever officer. You have to apply the same frameworks and concepts to get people to achieve goals together. But one thing that is absolutely universal that I think we, honestly, I think we forget it in Silicon Valley or a lot of people don't sort of internalize it, is that if you want to accomplish something truly extraordinary, if you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult.

(00:05:56):
It's going to be really uncomfortable. And you got to sort of remind people of that, that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. They have definitely screwed up somehow. It's not that an extraordinary effort is sufficient to an extraordinary outcome, but it is 100% true that it is necessary. And so I do use that framework as a sort of guiding principle in my own leadership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:23):
To make this even more real for people, what are examples of moments that were extraordinarily hard?

Matt MacInnis (00:06:29):
It is not about any sort of grand single story. I think the story is actually told through a thousand little things. And so for me, the story is told through a thousand Jira tickets, not through a thousand grand events. The extraordinary effort thing is a reminder that it's supposed to be really fricking exhausting. It's supposed to be. So on Friday night, when you get hit with an escalation on Friday night, when you get sort of hit with a bunch of new bugs from someone in the engineering team that you've got a triage, those are the moments where great players and great teams are separated from good players and good teams. And it's so easy to say this at a company like Rippling because we're winning. As a company, for all of our foibles, and we should spend time today talking about where things are not perfect and not great, but the growth rate of the company on the revenue foundation that we have is extraordinary, really, really compelling.

(00:07:33):
And it gives you, as a leader, the air cover to get up in front of your team and say, "Hey guys, I need the last ounce of oil that you've got left." And if your company's not growing very quickly, if things aren't that great, if your growth rate is 30% or 40%, it doesn't feel as good as a contributor in that business to lean in and give everything you've got on Friday or Saturday or Sunday because you don't know that it's going to yield much. And so extraordinary results, outcomes demand extraordinary efforts, but if there's no chance at an extraordinary outcome, it's very hard to get the extraordinary effort. And so I like to remind people at Rippling at least that it's so rare to have the opportunity to be able to be a part of a team where the extraordinary effort that you do put in on Friday or whatever, whenever it is actually contributing to an extraordinary result.

(00:08:27):
It's a very special and rare thing, and it gives me a superpower as a leader because I can lean on that when I'm ringing the oil out of somebody who's in the bored and tired zone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:38):
I saw the same thing actually at Airbnb with Brian Chesky. It always felt like things were going great and maybe we could take a break after something we shipped was killing it. And it always felt like the opposite. It always felt like, how do we press the gas pedal further? How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? There's never a moment to take a break.

Matt MacInnis (00:08:57):
I spent seven years at Apple and learned under Steve Jobs when he was the CEO, learned what we called the death march, which is what we did to the engineers. It was like as soon as you shipped one version of the iPhone, you were just immediately thrown into the pit of building the next one and there was no break. It was just relentless and talk about an extraordinary outcome at the end of the day. There is no relief. In a competitive market, and if the market is valuable, it's competitive, no question. If you leave anything on the field, if you sort of leave a crack for your competitor, 100% chance they're going to go fill that crack. And so you have to be relentless. There can be no relaxation of the organization. It doesn't mean people can't come and go or people can't take vacations or live their lives, of course.

(00:09:48):
And it's not like people are human beings. You can't grind the individuals down, but the team as a collective group of people has to be sort of on the ball all the time. There can't be a break. And if you leave one, you're just begging for the slightly more hungry competitor to come in and eat your lunch. And that's the beauty of capitalism.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Also, very counterintuitively, and maybe the more optimistic perspective here is when you do give your team space to just twiddle their thumbs, bad things start to happen. Morale actually dips in my experience. People get distracted. They're like, "Oh, what are we even doing? It's not interesting." I find that keeping people busy and motivated and fired up, even though you may think they'll be happier taking a many week break and slowing things down, I find they get more, the more I actually goes down in those moments.

Matt MacInnis (00:10:44):
So here's a management framework that I use fairly often. As an executive, you don't know how to get any decision exactly right. It's not knowable. You don't know how much budget to allocate. You don't know how many people to put on a project. You don't know how to set a deadline for when you're going to ship something. But of course, you have to set some default so you make your best guess and then you manage to that best guess and you learn as you go because in software development and in business in general, everything's emergent. These are not things that are knowable top down or a priority. And so you take a best guess and knowing that you're not going to get the right answer, you need to decide whether over-steering or under-steering relative to your perceived midpoint is better. And so let's talk about staffing. When you staff a project, is it better to overstaff or is it better to under-staff knowing that you can't get it right? Well, it's better to under-staff. If you overstaff, you get everything that you just said. You get politics, you get people working, I think most importantly on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. You have like 20 things on a stack rank list and you know that you got to do the top five, but the next 15 data's kind of ambiguous, but you've overstaffed the project. So the next 10 things down are getting worked on. Before you even know if they're necessary, that is poison. It's wasteful, it slows you down, it creates crust. And so it's very clear that under-staffing is less evil than over-staffing. In this particular framework, the advice is under-staff deliberately, always. And then the wisdom, the wisdom element is to know not to under-under-staff and sort of knowing the difference between those two things.

(00:12:22):
And so that's the way we work at Rippling. Everyone is constantly asking for more resources and of course where we can afford to and where it's appropriate new resources arrive, but it is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
There's a previous guest, I forget who this was. They used this metaphor if they want their team to be dehydrated to always be wanting more water. And then eventually they're too dehydrated and okay, we needed someone to help. Interesting. Yeah. There's a line along the lines of extraordinary efforts I want to make sure I read because I think this is really good. This may be a way to summarize what you're saying, that good teams get tired and that's when great teams kick the good team's asses.

Matt MacInnis (00:13:04):
Yes. This was a quote actually from Sunil, and he found it from a women's basketball team coach. And it is, to my point earlier about you got to run the engine at the red line at all times because the minute you let your guard down, the minute you slow down, the minute you relax, the minute you leave a crack for your competition, the great teams are going to come in and kick the good team's. And it's like sports, I'm not a very sporty guy, but sports analogies are sort of irresistible because at the end of the day, business is a game and none of this matters. We're not going to carry it to the grave. It's like you're here to do this stuff because it somehow fulfills you while you're on the planet. And I love the sport of business and I find that sports, notwithstanding the fact that I watched very little of it, that military, those are very ripe sources of parallel concepts to apply in leadership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):
I find also those most intense, stressful, long nights are the moments you remember most and remember most fondly back to when you're building something. The key though is that it has to go well. As you said, if you are succeeding and winning, all of this is romantic in the end and nostalgic. Remember that time we built this thing and worked late nights and shipped this thing? If it doesn't go anywhere, you don't feel that. So I think that's a really important component of this is you need to be winning and succeeding.

Matt MacInnis (00:14:23):
One thing that I've learned from Parker, Parker's our CEO at Rippling, he said, "You don't really learn from your mistakes, you learn from your successes." And it's like you do, of course, and he would admit you learn a bit from mistakes, but I do think that this is sort of feel good that it's like, "Well, you didn't succeed, but at least you learned something." I've had failures. When I look back at the nine years I spent working on inkling from day one in 2009 until we sold that business to a private equity firm in 2018, up the curve of Silicon Valley coolness, back down the other side into obscurity. Of course, I learned and grew a ton during that time, but in now what I think is six or seven years, I'm trying to do the math, seven years coming up on at Rippling, I've learned so much more because I've seen success.

(00:15:13):
I've seen rapid, wild, crazy off the charts success of the business and it's more informative. There's more to glean from seeing how it's done right than there is to glean from seeing how it's done wrong. If I tell you you're going to get on an airplane and one maintenance technician has seen it done right a hundred times and the other maintenance technician has seen it done wrong a hundred times, but he learned from his mistakes, but still hasn't had any success himself. I mean, give me a break. There's not even a comparison which plane you're going to feel more comfortable on. And so I do think that learning from your mistakes thing is a bit of a feel good trope that actually has very little substance in reality. And it's why as an early career product manager, or it's why frankly at any stage of your career when you want to learn, you should join a winning team.

(00:15:57):
It's cool to go and start a company at 22. Good luck to you. The odds are not in your favor, but the folks who, when I look at a resume and I see that someone's joined, they were at really good companies when those companies were super exciting and in crazy growth mode. I'm like, "I instantly want to interview that candidate because I want to hear what they learned from being part of a winning team." And that's sort of one of my go to heuristics when I'm looking at candidate profiles and I think it's an under-told trope. Sorry, not an under-told trope. It's a piece of advice that I don't think people embrace enough in the valley that success begets success and you should chase success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):
Speaking of success and learning, you've been a long time COO at Rippling and the reason you're here recently you moved into CPO, chief product officer at Rippling, which is very exciting and very rare. I don't see a lot of COOs moving into product. Let me ask you why did you move into that role? I feel like you've been killing it at COO. Maybe that's the reason. Be careful what you're good at. And also just what are some surprises about this, about moving into product? Because a lot of people imagine what it's like and then you're actually doing it.

Matt MacInnis (00:17:08):
The story at Rippling is pretty interesting and I'll tell it because I think it explains why I'm making this transition, but this isn't really about me. I think it's sort of a pattern that your listeners would find useful. In general, your best executives are the ones that you can mostly toss into any challenge and they will bring order to chaos. They will fix the thing. And I do appreciate the terms that people have used at Rippling for me, talking about MacInnis's injured birds, where at any given moment some function is in disarray or in jeopardy and I go and focus very carefully on that function to get it back in order batting 800 maybe, like not always wild success, but I did that everywhere except R&D. I would think about helping out with components of the sales organization like our channel team, or I spent time building out the recruiting function a few times when it needed to be sort of rethought in response to our growth, but it never R&D.

(00:18:23):
And so I would have my feet up on the table looking out across the floor at this dumpster fire off in the distance, just sort of emitting smoke and wondering if someone was going to go in and deal with that. And the smoke takes various forms and when you're growing as quickly as rippling is growing, it's not always something that necessarily even impacts customers, but it's the sort of thing where you're like, that architecture's not right or they're not measuring adoption correctly." From the outside, I actually had quite a few criticisms that I could lob in. And what happened at Rippling was we made some hiring mistakes. I think the folks that we had in those roles would agree that they weren't the right people. We had a hiring mistake in engineering leadership where the product leader at the time had to sort of run engineering.

(00:19:07):
We subsequently had a mistake in product hiring and a lot of us had to sort of pitch in. And Parker and I sort of stared at each other through two years of this kind of disarray or this chaos or this agony of things and just never really having good executive leadership over both engineering and product at the same time. And I remember Parker sort of slumped down in his seat and said, "Oh, I have to run another search." And I said, "No, the gig's up. I'm going to go do it." And he really sprung up in his seat. He's like, "Really? You'll go do that?" I'm like, "Dude, this is what the business needs." And so that's what I did. And that really started about a year ago in sort of, I realized I was going to do it and expressed that to Parker in December. I really took it on in January of '25.

(00:19:51):
And so it's been 11 months of learning. Jumping into the product role when the product function itself, although staffed with really talented people, wildly under understaffed, and without a single spiritual leader on top of it to drive consistency and process excellence had become locally optimized but globally incoherent. And if you know Conway's law, you are destined to ship your org chart. And so with a locally optimized, globally incoherent team, you had a locally optimized, globally incoherent product experience that needed to be resolved. And so my efforts over the last 11 months have been to establish greater clarity in terms of how we do things around here, better process, better general leadership, hiring and firing. I mean, just doing the sort of cleanup on aisle three that needed to be done, even though, again, a lot of the people in the team were quite talented and doing an excellent job of managing their specific domains.

(00:20:52):
Jumping into the product role has been quite eye-opening. I feel a little bashful about the naivety of my view from the outside a year ago. Product teams have a hierarchy of needs, and we like to point at the failures to meet elements of that hierarchy higher up the triangle and sort of impugn the failure of that organization for not, as an example, measuring adoption metrics very carefully and not closely tracking those metrics as a means by which to drive execution. When I jumped in, I was like, "Man, we need to establish some basic standards for test coverage. We need to establish some basic standards for how we do what I call a factory inspection on a product once it's ready to roll off the assembly line." Do we have a checklist for what we call product quality and what does product quality mean? Those basic things weren't there. And so the idea that we should be spending time measuring adoption metrics is absolute insanity.

(00:22:08):
You're skipping a lot of steps between here and there. And so we have made great strides and I think it's translating to product quality improvements for our customers, but I feel, as I said, a little dumb for the way I was thinking about it before I jumped into the deep end. There is just no excuse as an executive for sitting outside of the mess and thinking you know the answers. It's a cardinal sin as an executive to do that. You need to go and see. You'd be in the boiler room, you need to study the system, bottom up and develop hypotheses for how to amend the system. And that's what I've been doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
I love hearing this because so many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well and hearing from someone that is not a longtime product person come in and try to fix these problems, I think is really useful and interesting for people to hear. To dig into this a little bit more, was the big lesson and kind of eye-opening moment that there's a lot of foundational work that needs to happen to achieve this outcome that you're trying to achieve, which is measure engagement and adoption well? Is it like tracking and metrics and data science? Is that kind of the lesson there?

Matt MacInnis (00:23:18):
The lesson is that everything must be done in its time and order, and you can move really, really quickly. There's no sort of excuse not to move with urgency on all of these things, but you got to do them in order and you have to lead bottom up. You got to lead from the specific circumstances you observe. And I think for me, one of the best things that's happened over the last 11 months is that I've gained a greater trust in my own instincts, that sort of patterns I've matched across other functions do indeed apply in product, but I have both the advantage and disadvantage of not having led a product function before and therefore must think about every problem from first principles. I have no choice. I can read shit on the internet. I can listen to clear thinkers on topics and import their ideas, but I'm very reluctant to import an idea without breaking it down into its constituent parts and figuring out how it applies at Rippling.

(00:24:29):
And so I don't actually give a shit about adoption metrics as a matter of principle. I care about adoption metrics when I care about adoption metrics. I realize that that's a total logical statement, but it's like I'll get there. And so in certain parts of our product, I really do care about adoption metrics. I care a lot about adoption metrics in our applicant tracking system, our recruiting product, because it's in a really good place from a usability standpoint, it's very well instrumented, it's got very happy users, it's got an awesome growth profile, and so we should still ...

Matt MacInnis (00:25:00):
It's got an awesome growth profile. So we should be really focused on the adoption metrics because I think that's going to be an important ingredient to low churn over time, removing friction from the implementation process as an example.

(00:25:13):
There are other parts of our product where I would say I don't care at all about adoption and am much more focused on foundational things like I said earlier, test coverage or whatever, just to make sure that the thing is stable and good and delivering exactly what it's supposed to deliver once it's adopted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:28):
Now that you're on the inside of the product team, what's something that you think people outside of product, say Matt two years ago or other, I don't know, go to market leads, other execs should hear, need to understand about product that they don't until they're on the inside?

Matt MacInnis (00:25:44):
I'll give you another framework that I like to use. In the financial world, there's this concept of alpha. Alpha is outperformance relative to the index. So that's why you have seekingalpha.com as a very popular website. What they mean by that is you're looking to buy something, some combination of assets that will outperform, let's say the S&P 500, if that's your benchmark. So alpha is the outperformance relative to the index.

(00:26:12):
And then you have the concept of beta. Beta is just volatility. Beta's not good. A high beta stock jerks around for no particular reason. It's discorrelated with the index. It's very high beta. Great if you're an options trader, but other than that, it's not really something you want in an asset.

(00:26:28):
So your ideal stock is a very high alpha, very low beta stock. They don't really come in that shape because alpha and beta tend to be correlated, but that's what you want when you buy a financial asset.

(00:26:40):
So what's the analogy? I think you have high alpha people who are very valuable. I think you also have low beta people who are also very valuable people. Dennis Rodman, basketball player, nut job, very high alpha. And there's room on every team for one Dennis Rodman is a favorite of mine. It's like you can have one difficult employee who's got a ton of upside.

(00:27:12):
So this alpha beta thing, I use it pretty often when contemplating what kind of person I want and also what kind of process I want. So when you're building a product from zero to one, you're probably pursuing alpha. You're looking for some angle on this market or this customer problem where the product is actually going to provide an outsized return relative to whatever the default solution is. When you have a more mature product or if you have somebody in the product operations group or whatever, you probably want a more low beta environment where it's like it cranks it out, it does it very reliably.

(00:27:44):
Our payroll product, we badly want the payroll product to be very low beta. We really don't want the payroll product to have any unpredictability or aberration, and so we're willing to accept more process.

(00:27:55):
And here's a fundamental principle of design in an organization, which is that processes, processes in a business exist for the sole purpose of lowering beta. Processes are for decreasing volatility in the output of the system. The downside of a process is that it suppresses alpha. And you have to be super, super careful and judicious in the application of process and the product team to know that you're lowering beta in the places where you want to do that without suppressing alpha in the places where you need it.

(00:28:35):
So as we've gone through the last year of reforming the way that we build product at Rippling, it's been a game of recognizing those places where I need to implement a touch of process, just a touch. Other places where I need to implement a very clear, rigid process where I don't want alpha, I just want low beta. So examples of this are let's say our product quality list, which we lovingly at Rippling call the PQL.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):
Why PQL?

Matt MacInnis (00:29:01):
Yeah, so it's actually a really important thing. I think if you want to bring about cultural change in a team ... Look, we have 1,300 people in our R&D organization. It's a big ship that we have to steer. If you want to create a moment that sticks in people's brains and sort of becomes a zeitgeist or something that they latch onto, you got to create an entity, a vessel for meaning, and then you got to fill that vessel with your meaning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
A meme, you might say.

Matt MacInnis (00:29:24):
Yeah, well, sure, a meme. A meme is actually a good example of this in common culture. In pop culture. I think it's why, when people come to the table with ideas from the outside, I welcome those outside ideas. But the first thing I ask the person to do is to tell me what they mean without using those words. So when someone comes in and says, "Hey, I want to do this thing on strategy." I'm like, "Cool. Tell me what you mean without using the word strategy." And it forces them to break it down into its constituent parts. And if they can articulate it clearly without using that word, I know that they know what they're talking about. And if they just fumble around with the word strategy again, I'm like, "Okay, you actually haven't thought this through."

(00:30:01):
So with the PQL, with the product quality list, it's like I could come up with some generic term for this, but I really want a new joiner at the company to understand that this is an idiosyncratic thing to Rippling. This is unique to us. You want to understand this thing. I also want it to become a component of common parlance in the day-to-day work of the product management and engineering teams. So PQL, as cheeky or silly as it sounds, was deliberately sort of angular or stood out as a vessel I could fill with a particular meaning, and so we have a product quality list.

(00:30:32):
And the product quality list is lightweight in the sense that it just articulates in the simplest ways the standards we want you to meet when you ship a product. It doesn't apply to every product, not every line applies to every product, but it's comprehensive and it provides me with a framework for iterating over time as we learn.

(00:30:50):
So just yesterday, we shipped the product to Parker. This is part of our process. When we ship a new product, it goes to Parker, who is the big admin for Rippling at Rippling. If you're not aware, Parker is the sole payroll administrator for Rippling for all 5,200 employees. He personally runs payroll always, there is no exception, for all 5,200 people. He does complain about it sometimes, but it's a remarkable achievement for the software and perhaps for him. So he also installs any new app that we're going to install for ourselves because we dog food the hell out of everything we build.

(00:31:22):
Yesterday, he goes to install this new application. We're about to ship a new app for feedback, allowing people to give one another feedback on their companies. And he installs it and he goes in and it dumps them onto an empty screen. And he's like, "What the fuck is this? What is this? What's going on? Hey, wow, talk about fail." So I chop another one of my fingers off, I'm down to nine. And I'm like, "Well, what did we miss?"

(00:31:48):
What we missed was there was a fucking feature flag, a fucking feature flag. And I'm not allowed to say feature flag without fucking in front of it because feature flags are the bane of my existence and the worst things in the world that constantly cause problems. Engineers put one in temporarily and forget about it. It's like shims if you're building a house and the general contractor puts little shims in places and then forgets that they put the shims there and then builds a wall over them and eventually the shim fails and all of a sudden your door doesn't fit. Feature flags are super dangerous and need to be managed carefully, so fucking feature flags.

(00:32:18):
Anyway, we had one. Parker installs it, they forgot to disable the feature flag. He gets a blank screen when he installs the application. What did I do? My reaction was, "Ugh." Go back to the team, give them direct feedback, tell them not to make that mistake again. But also ask the question, "How do we miss this in the factory inspection process?"

(00:32:37):
And the answer is we didn't have any line item in the PQL for feature flags. So I added a line to the fucking PQL that said, "You are allowed to have one feature flag that governs your entire product at ship." It's an extreme standard that might not be achievable, but it's the standard we aspire to.

(00:32:59):
This framework, the PQL, given these lightweight checklists, iterated on consistently in response to everything we learn as we go, constitutes a very nice lightweight way to lower the beta of the system with hopefully only a modicum of negative impact on the alpha for how we build product.

(00:33:22):
You asked me a very simple question, I gave you a very long-winded answer, but these frameworks help me design systems that scale across one going to 2,000 technical workers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):
Wow. Okay. By the way, PQL, is that like an acronym or it's just like, I like this word we're going to call it PQL?

Matt MacInnis (00:33:40):
Product quality list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
Okay, I see. So it's the [inaudible 00:33:44]. Okay.

Matt MacInnis (00:33:46):
PQL, which how could you pronounce it other than pickle?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):
I'm imagining all your decks have little PQL emojis and the-

Matt MacInnis (00:33:53):
The pickle emoji thing, the dancing pickle in Slack, there's a lot of-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:56):
[inaudible 00:33:56].

Matt MacInnis (00:33:56):
Yeah. It lends itself to a bit of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):
What I think about is pickle Rick. Do you get that reference?

Matt MacInnis (00:34:02):
This is a Rorschach test.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:04):
Okay. So this high alpha, low beta, I love this concept. So the idea is depending on the team, depending on the problem, we need a high alpha, low beta person or actually okay with a lot of variants for this specific project that's actually [inaudible 00:34:16]-

Matt MacInnis (00:34:16):
Yeah, we're willing to accept a bunch of volatility in this area in exchange for the upside we get from the creativity and risk taking of these people or the lack of process that sort of gives them the latitude to do what they want to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:26):
So when you're hiring, you're looking for, again, is this person low beta or not? That's going to [inaudible 00:34:30]-

Matt MacInnis (00:34:30):
For sure. It's really quite a useful way. You know when you meet a candidate and you ... My modus operandi, and I think with talk about hiring for a second, I think I've spent a lot of time with teams at Rippling talking about how I hire. And it is born of batting practice. It'd be super interesting to actually be able to rewind the tape on my life and sort of contemplate how many candidates I've met in every context. Many thousands, maybe tens of thousands, I don't know. It's a lot of batting practice and a lot of model training in my brain.

(00:35:06):
So I rely a lot of my intuition, which of course HR people say you're not supposed to do. That's complete bullshit. If you have a good intuition, you should absolutely rely on your intuition.

(00:35:15):
And what you have to do after you have a reaction to a candidate when you're looking at hiring somebody is you need to decode your intuition so that it can be expressed to other people productively. So one of the frameworks that I use for this is SPOTAC. It's a very ugly acronym. There's a hat tip to somebody out there in the universe who originally thought of this. It's not me, but I adopted it. And it's that people are smart, passionate, optimistic, tenacious, adaptable, and kind. Those five things. Six, can't even count. I told you I lost a finger when I made a mistake, so I was down one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:54):
Nine to go.

Matt MacInnis (00:35:54):
SPOTAC isn't by itself a good top down framework, but when you're thinking about, "Oh, why did this candidate just ... Why did it not click? Why did I not like them?" You go down the list, you're like, "Oh, yeah, no, this person, it's that they were not excited about the idea. They weren't passionate." It's that they talked shit about their previous manager and that they were a victim of the performance of their last two companies. That's what it was, they're not optimistic.

(00:36:24):
The framework is super useful to evaluating people. And I think the alpha beta framework is also super useful when you come away from a conversation and you're like, "I like that guy. I think he'd be really, really good. Why is it that I don't think he would do a good job on this product in particular?" And the answer is like, "This is a high alpha product area and he's a low beta person." Valuable, but definitely not the right fit for this. So I think it's really useful in that context as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):
I love all these frameworks. You're speaking to this audience, framework to frameworks, frameworks.

Matt MacInnis (00:36:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:53):
So high alpha, low beta, sometimes high beta is okay, SPOTAC. In hiring, is there anything else that you find really useful? Before we move on to a different topic.

Matt MacInnis (00:37:03):
When I first started working in the product organization, I was introduced to an interview framework or an interview tactic that I hadn't really used much at all, I think in my career, which is that every product person at every seniority level is given the same case study. And the case study is extraordinarily difficult. It requires you to think about many, many dimensions simultaneously, to think about data propagation issues. It gets quite technical.

(00:37:37):
And the rubric that we use to sort of evaluate performance of that case study is it gives you guidance on what for us, like an entry level PM looks like, what a junior, mid-career, senior executive PM might look like. And everybody comes away from that interview feeling like poop, like they had failed it. Whereas on our side of it, we're like, "Wow, that person got really far." They saw around three or four corners in a really impressive way. There was 10 they didn't see around, but they saw around four of the hardest ones. And they were not defensive when we gave them new information that called into question the validity of their solution. And they were willing to interrupt us to ask more questions," and and and, like a lot of the sort of basic human interaction models.

(00:38:25):
You never think that giving someone an impossible task and even including the L5 person versus the VP on the same thing would be productive. And let's just say our recruiting team still sort of kvetches a bit about this and feels like we eliminate people too aggressively at this stage of the interview process. But I've found the wisdom in it and think it's actually quite useful to give everyone the same simple, complicated prompt and just see. Hand them a drill bit, give them the concrete wall and see if they can get a millimeter or an inch into the concrete. They're never going to get all the way through the wall. It doesn't matter. You're going to learn a lot. And I've found that to be kind of an eye-opening new thing for me that has been fun.

(00:39:04):
Look, the joy of product and the joy of product management and the joy of being part of product, I think there's a bunch of joys actually, if I could give you a sort of running list, but one of the big joys is that you get to work with some of the smartest people in software. Engineers are very smart. They're not always the best sort of social entities. Salespeople are awesome social entities. They're not always the best systems thinkers. You go down the list.

(00:39:28):
But the magic of product management is that you kind of have to ... We talk about the mini CEO. I think it's kind of a stupid misnomer, but there's some wisdom there. And I think the wisdom is that you have to be a polymath. You've got to be really good at working with other people. You got to be good at communications and articulation. You got to be good at project management. You got to be good at the science and the math and the engineering. And it's really fucking cool. So I think one of the great joys of this job for me has been interacting with the tippity top of the smartest and most polymathic people in the industry.

(00:40:01):
I'll say one other thing about what I love about leading product, which is as a COO, my job was to accept the product as it was and optimize everything around that. My job was to make sure that the product operations, in our business, the interface to the insurance carriers, the interface to the payment entities, the government regulators, that stuff all just sort of worked. It was to make sure that our sales engine, our marketing engine, all the go to-market stuff optimized itself around what the product was. It was about recruiting and making sure we got people in to work on the product. You kind of go down any function that isn't in R&D, and I had some hand in trying to figure out how to make that function work to the best of its ability, given what the product was.

(00:40:48):
And now that I lead product, I'm like, "Oh, wow. This is the high order bit." Not that I didn't sort of understand that, but now I really get that product is the high order bit. If you get the product right, it fits in the market, everything else gets easier. Finance is easier, sales is easier, marketing is easier, recruiting is easier, everything gets fucking easier. So I think the other joy of leading the product function is that I get to set the highest order bit in the business's success to one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:22):
This is really great to hear. A lot of times people outside product don't understand these sorts of things and look down on product a lot of times, especially sales folks, COOs a lot of times. I love that you're seeing this and realizing this and recognizing just how important and interesting and challenging this work is and just how awesome PMs are. As you know, a lot of people are a very anti-product manager. "Why do we need product managers? We don't need them. Slow everything down, all this process."

Matt MacInnis (00:41:51):
Yeah. I have a distinction there, which is that I'm anti-shitty product managers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):
That's exactly how I put it. If you hate product managers, you just haven't worked with a great product manager.

Matt MacInnis (00:41:58):
Well, it's like, look, I love wine, wine's one of my things. And I've learned a lot about wine. And one of my favorite lines is like, "I don't like Chardonnay." And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no. Chardonnay's are the most fucking amazing varieties of wine in the world. You just haven't had good Chardonnay. And there's a Chardonnay out there for you." Product management, it's like you don't like product management, you think product managers suck. It's like, well, you just haven't had a good Chardonnay yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:22):
That's exactly what I [inaudible 00:42:24]-

Matt MacInnis (00:42:24):
Once you have one, you can't unlearn it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:26):
You're like, "Let's find that PM ASAP."

Matt MacInnis (00:42:30):
No, let's find that Chardonnay ASAP.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
[inaudible 00:42:34] with some Chardonnay. You touched on this product market fit point, and I want to double down on this thread. You've had a couple really interesting experiences of struggling to find product market fit with your own startup. You said you worked on it for nine years, you said?

Matt MacInnis (00:42:47):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):
Okay. And then with Rippling, complete opposite, extreme product market fit, up and to the right. What's something you've learned about just that that you think people maybe don't understand about what it feels like, what it takes to get to product market fit, how things change?

Matt MacInnis (00:42:59):
There's a line that this venture capitalist, whose name I will not mention, said, which was that product market fit is a sort of thing where you absolutely know it when you see it, and therefore if you don't absolutely know it, you don't have it.

(00:43:17):
And this kind of gets back to my point about learning from mistakes versus successes. It's like, ah, man, over and over again, over the course of the many years that I spent at Inkling, we thought we had it. We thought we had product market fit, maybe, maybe. And in hindsight, with the benefit of now having experienced solid product market fit, it was so, so obvious that we didn't.

(00:43:45):
And I've invested in like 60 companies or 70 companies. I don't know, it's not something I actively do. But opportunities, by virtue, I think, of my role at Rippling, sort of show up. And I talk to lots of entrepreneurs and I love it and I find it super stimulating and I love the fresh ideas and it's just something I do as a real cherry on top of the sport that I play already. But when I get the investor updates for the guys who've been at it for like three, four years and I read the updates from them that I sent to my investors in 2011 and 2012, I'm kind of heartbroken.

(00:44:29):
We talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital bullshit. The incentive of venture capitalist is to put money into your company and milk you dry. They never get their money back. There is no way for them to take that investment back. So the only logical desire that they would have is for you to keep trying against all odds because there is the occasional example where someone pivoted from A to X and it was wildly different and it worked. Slack was originally some sort of a gaming company and became corporate chat. Airbnb maybe. It's like there's some examples of companies having made wild pivots and succeeded, but man, is that rare. Just so exceedingly rare.

(00:45:21):
And I think it's important to remember, I'm 45 years old, we're going to be on the planet, the average age of a man in the United States when he dies is something in the mid 70s. I got 20, 30, maybe if I'm lucky, 40 years left on the planet. Very conscious of the time that I have. And I don't regret what I did at Inkling, I learned a lot. It informed what I do now. I don't think the chapter I'm in right now could have come without the chapters before it. So it's a beautiful, wonderful thing that I did what I did. But when I read the investor update and I'm like, "You're where I was and you are not getting out of this."

(00:45:56):
The Silicon Valley try until you die mindset is not pro-entrepreneur, it's pro-venture capitalist. And I know why that is, but I think it's important to say out loud that you should fucking quit. You should reset the clock, you should reset the cap table because trust me, product market fit when it arrives is insane and it's exciting and you should pursue it. And never delude yourself into believing you have it when you don't. It is dangerous and regrettable. How's that for a speech?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:33):
Beautiful. The anti-VC speech. The-

Matt MacInnis (00:46:38):
I got more where that came from. By the way, it's not anti-VC. It's anti-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
VC propaganda.

Matt MacInnis (00:46:45):
Everybody's acting in accordance with their incentives in Silicon Valley, the executives, the founders, the venture ... Everybody's, of course, behaving in accordance with their incentives. And the venture capitalists have very strong enduring incentives that have shaped the dynamic of how Silicon Valley works. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just really, really important to point them out and scream at them for the 25-year-old entrepreneur who has no fucking clue how this stuff works.

(00:47:12):
Trust me, the 45-year-old entrepreneur or the 50-year-old venture capitalist who've been in the game for a while, they get it. They've observed it. They know what it's like. The system is there to take advantage of the people who don't, or at least it is the easiest prey for the incentive structures, not for venture capitalists as individual people who are beautiful and all of them are just really wonderful people. It's just that the incentive structures lead to some real harm, I think, in certain cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:37):
And the thing I find is when you do quit, VCs ... I'm always just like, "Hey, let me know when you're starting your next thing. I'm excited to invest." They're rarely, unless they're not a great VC, rarely are they just pissed at you for how could you possibly not make this work [inaudible 00:47:52].

Matt MacInnis (00:47:52):
That's the thing, as a founder, when it's time to throw in the towel on your business and you're so obsessed with giving money back to the cap table, I always remind the entrepreneur like, "Hey, if you're in the seed investing game, your forecast is zero. Your assumption on every investment is that it's going to go to zero." Any seed investor who doesn't take that stance is off their rocker anyway. They're a very bad investor. Seek investors who play the long game, who want to be in your second and third company and are willing to take a bet on the first one and let it go to zero so that you can get on with stuff. This is like, I've had that conversation many times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:28):
This episode is brought to you by GoFundMe Giving Funds, the zero-fee donor-advised fund. I want to tell you about a new DAF product that GoFundMe just launched that makes year-end giving easy. GoFundMe Giving Funds is the DAF or donor-advised fund supported by the world's number one giving platform and trusted by over 200 million people. It's basically your own mini foundation, without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or appreciated assets like stocks, get the tax deduction right away, potentially reduce capital gains, and then decide later where you want to donate. There are zero admin or asset fees, and you can lock in your deductions now and decide where to give later, which is perfect for year-end giving. Join the GoFundMe community of over 200 million people and start saving money on your tax bill, all while helping the causes that you care about most. Start your giving fund today at gofundme.com/lenny. If you transfer your existing DAF over, they'll even cover the DAF pay fees. That's gofundme.com/lenny to get started. This begs the question of just when is it time to quit? If people hearing this might be like, "Oh man," what are some signs that, okay, it's time to wrap it up?

Matt MacInnis (00:49:38):
Here, look, history provides us with a clear guide. When you look at companies having hit it big, they hit big pretty quick. It's very, very dangerous to be late to the party, it's very, very dangerous to be early to the party, and the vast majority of the time, that's the problem. Rippling, had it been started in 2014, would not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what-

Matt MacInnis (00:50:00):
...Not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what it is five years from now today, and so I think timing is a lot and it's very hard to control for, but when you get the timing right and the market is real and the product works, product market fit, like I said earlier, it's super clear, and so if I were to pick a number out of a hat just from my lived experience, I think it's very important, one aside, don't ask people for advice, ask people for relevant experience. If you ask them for advice, they will always give it, but if you ask them for relevant experience, they rarely have any to offer, and if they don't have any to offer, then don't ask for their advice.

(00:50:41):
So ask people for relevant experience, and I try to do this with my own entrepreneurs when I work with them, it's like, let me offer you whatever relevant experience I have, and my relevant experience on this topic of when to quit is like, I think we could have called it after the second or third pivot, which was somewhere around year four. It is of course very important to believe in what you're building and to be persistent, but there is definitely no shame in saying, "Look, we've pivoted once or twice. It's not catching. I got to go do the next thing," and I think if you're year four, year five in your entrepreneurship journey, and it's not just obviously a screaming rip-roaring growth story, it's extraordinarily difficult. This is so extremely rare. So beyond even already the rare scores you're going to face from the outset that now is going to convert to something crazy. So that's hard to hear, I guess, but man, it can be really liberating when you're like, "Fuck it, I'm going to do this. I have the energy. I'm going to do it again. I'm just going to do it with a clean sheet."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:48):
That is really helpful. You have this really fun way of describing product market fit around receptors and drugs.

Matt MacInnis (00:51:54):
Oh yeah. Yeah. I think this is a really fundamentally misunderstood dynamic. When founders message me and they're like, "Hey, like my LinkedIn post and my tweet for this launch," I do it. I retweet it, I like it, whatever. Nobody follows my Twitter anyways, it doesn't matter, but I do that, but I think to myself, this is not what this is about. This is not how great companies are built. It can be a nucleating event, but it's not a major thing, because nobody cares about your company. Your launch doesn't matter. Big, fat, pull the slingshot back, launches amount to the teeniest thimble of water in the ocean of noise about startups and companies, and so you just got to build it brick by brick bottom up, and these launches don't really amount to much, and so how do you think about that? How do you think about the insignificance of your launch or you think about all the effort you're putting into building a product that you believe is going to have product market fit?

(00:52:56):
Well, if you recognize that the market is immutable, no amount of tweeting, LinkedIn posting, advertising is going to change whether the market wants your product. It might raise awareness about your product, but it's not going to change whether somebody wants it. Then you take a different mindset. You have to view your startup as running an experiment in the universe to see what you get in return for that, and this analogy of drug discovery and binding receptors is like nobody at Genentech thinks they can market their way to better performance inside your body. The binding receptors for that drug, they exist or they don't, and when they build their product, their goal is to find out whether the binding receptors exist, but fate already has decided the outcome. This is absolutely true of every software product you build. Fate has already decided the outcome. The market's either going to latch onto your product and run with it or it's not. Do not ship the product, find a lack of success, and then try to market your way through that, because the binding receptors likely don't exist, and for me, it was a very liberating mindset, because now I just have to find the right drug, and I can forget trying to convince the body to develop the binding receptors for whatever it is that I'm building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:13):
What I love about your advice here is you were an early investor in Notion, which is one of the classic stories of it took them... I think it was four years to get to something. They moved to Japan, they worked on the whole thing, and so is [inaudible 00:54:24] from there? Is that a rare example where it actually worked? And that's not an example to be inspired by, because it's extremely, extremely rare. Let's talk about alpha beta again.

Matt MacInnis (00:54:32):
Okay. As an investor, you might build a checklist of things you want to make sure are true or false about a company and hope that that's going to yield the kind of investment success you're looking for. Does it have this kind of founder? Is it a C Corp in Delaware? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and these checklists are all about what? They're all about suppressing beta. They're about avoiding avoidable mistakes. They're about bringing stability. Jeff Lewis is an investor who has many angular views on things, and I think one of his most enduring phrases is narrative violations. This idea that the common wisdom must be violated in some way by every company that has an outsized success. It is absolutely true, and when I give these general observations on the patterns in Silicon Valley, the most successful businesses inevitably violate something on that list in some really important way.

(00:55:37):
So Notion, you can't replicate Notion's success as an entrepreneur. You can't replicate it because you're not Ivan. You can't replicate it because you're not Notion. You can't replicate it because it's not 2010 when they started the company. Do the math on that. Or 2011, actually. These guys stuck with it. They went through hell. They pivoted. They went to Japan and sat in kimonos and meditated on what they were going to build, and by hook/crook, they got to where they are today as a really wildly successful business in an extraordinarily difficult market where building businesses is virtually impossible in productivity. It is dominated by Google and Microsoft. Carving out your own niche in that market is just unthinkable, and so I look at Notion as having succeeded by virtue of the narrative violation of persistence, I don't think is a good idea for very many people that happen to work for them, and I look at it as being a function of the founding team and their specific idiosyncrasies, the absolute insistence on craftsmanship from Ivan. This is him. That's his thing.

(00:56:55):
The takeaway lesson is not give up or don't give up. The takeaway lesson is certainly not go do what Notion did. The takeaway lesson is that every company succeeds on the foundations of the idiosyncrasies of the founder. The idiosyncrasies of the founder. Rippling succeeds for almost the polar opposite reasons that Notion succeeds, but in both cases, the companies succeed on the idiosyncrasies of the founder, and so embracing that, recognizing those idiosyncrasies, that's what great investors do. They spot that element of spikiness and greatness in a candidate investment, and they convert that to a commitment, and then of course the investor or the good ones accept what they get in exchange from that for the universe, from the universe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):
I love that we went in this direction. I wasn't planning to talk about your investing career. Just to give people a reason to listen to this and maybe rewind, and I want to ask another question around investing. What are some other companies you invested in early?

Matt MacInnis (00:57:55):
First of all, okay, so I sort of hate the question. What are some other companies you've invested in? It's a fair question, but the problem is I'm going to give you a bunch of companies I've invested in that won, that are really notable. So what I would like to do instead of answering that question ... Here, let me give you some bait. I was one of the first investors in Notion. I was perhaps the first, I don't know, ask Ivan. Clever, which had a great exit. I was one of the first investors in Zenefits, if you've heard of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):
Heard of it.

Matt MacInnis (00:58:27):
I was, before I joined, one of the first investors in Rippling, and then more recently invested in ... Here's a funny one. I was one of the first investors in Deal, if you've heard of them.

(00:58:43):
I was able to exit that position, and then hopefully that company's going to zero with their criminal behavior, but whatever, but more recently, if you know Decagon, which is doing some really cool stuff on the AI front.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):
Killing it.

Matt MacInnis (00:59:00):
I'm in laying chain. Great. So those are some companies that you maybe have heard of, but how about I invested in Macro. Founder was Derek Lee. Macro's out of business. I invested in Debrief, Ned Rockson. It's out of business. I invested in Verb Data with David Hertz out of business. I'm reading from a list. I invested in... What's the number? 70 companies according to this list where I track things and most of them went to zero and all those founders were awesome, all those founders were kick, and all those founders put a ton of energy into building their businesses, and they went to zero and they're enduring relationships.

(00:59:37):
I can call on any of those people, I think, maybe with the exception of Deal, and call in a favor and have... and I've got a few subsequent... and actually a lot of them joined Rippling, believe it or not. So I don't know. Companies I've invested in is a long list, and I love to give you names of companies that don't exist anymore because it's self-serving and a horrible survivorship bias to just list the good ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:00):
I love that answer. I think you're being modest in the context of your hit rate is clearly very high. Even one or two incredibly successful companies out of 70 is a win in VC, and so you're doing very well, but I think that's a really important perspective. When you see people's logos on their websites of all the companies they've invested in, you have no idea how many hit bats they've had.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:22):
I think it's good practice to ask people to give you the full list. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:24):
What are your favorite failures that you've invested in?

Matt MacInnis (01:00:29):
Oh, no. I'm not actually... Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):
Well, obviously, no, we don't need spend time on it, but I think it's actually a really good question, but yeah, what are some of your best failed investments? Show me the logos of the companies that didn't work out.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:39):
It's a juicy question. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
There's a topic around this area that I wanted to spend time on, and I haven't heard anyone think of things this way, which is this idea you talk about of compounding plus power law plus entropy and how that's a really useful frame to think about business.

Matt MacInnis (01:00:58):
So you kicked this conversation off sort of invoking the extraordinary outcomes, demand, extraordinary efforts line, hat tip to Dan Gill, and these are part and parcel. Man, understanding the nature of the universe is a pretty good way to work within it, and so power law distributions happen everywhere. It explains why so few people control so much wealth. It explains why Steph Curry is just so vastly better than the next guy down on the list on the basketball team. It explains why populations are concentrated into a relatively small number of mega cities in the world. It's like, power law distribution just plays out everywhere, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. It sort of plays out in many dynamics.

(01:01:47):
People tend to think that the world plays on a more linear relationship where the X and Y axis are sort of Y equals X, but that is absolutely not the case, and the implications are profound. It's like if you build something to 80 or 90%, the Y axis is barely budged yet. You haven't hit the inflection point in terms of reward, and so the implication of the power law more broadly is that people who are in the top 10%, the top 5%, don't just get 10 or 20% more reward. They get 10X the reward or 100X the reward. It's really dramatic.

(01:02:20):
Entropy, the second law of thermodynamics is a very simple concept. It's the reason your sock drawer becomes messy. It's the reason that potholes form. It's the reason we have to put so much energy into maintaining the aircraft we fly to keep them safe because they really, really, really want to fall apart, and that's the nature of things. If you abandon a city for a few months, it starts to go fallow, and so entropy is just this concept that shit tends toward disorder.

(01:02:48):
The universe, I mean, life itself is a temporary victory against entropy. You and I should not exist. The sun gives energy to the planet. It organizes stuff that we can eat and we fight entropy until we lose the battle somewhere, as I said earlier at the age of 70 or 80, if we're lucky. What does this have to do with product? This is really about effort.

(01:03:17):
The only antidote to entropy, the only antidote to decay in a system is energy. You got to inject energy. So if you have a code base, every line of code that you add to that code base increases the entropy of that system and demands ever more energy from human beings to go and intend to it to make sure it doesn't break, and if you want to achieve greatness, if you want an extraordinary outcome, and in particular, if you want to be in the top 10%, top 5% on the X axis so that the Y axis is through the roof, then you have to relentlessly inject energy at every single step of the game. Teams will, sadly, but because we are all human, teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes.

(01:04:11):
Not because they get together and think, "We should do that," although unions do do that unequivocally, deliberately, but even in a collection of product managers or engineers, what's going to happen over time is entropy is going to creep in and people are going to optimize for local comfort. Your job as an executive, as a leader, is to fight that entropy tooth and nail every single day. It means that every time you see a bug, every time you see a bug, not most of the time, every time you go and you drop it at the feet of the product manager or the engineering manager, every time, in public, preferably, it means that every time someone comes to you to hire someone and says that they have skipped the back channel, every time you're like, "You can't hire this person unless you do the back channel," it means that when you get into the board and tired zone on any process, that you as the executive have got to demand the 99th percentile of energy, because otherwise entropy creeps in and the system decays. You have to do this.

(01:05:19):
One of the messages that I delivered recently at our big executive big... Like our top 75 manager offsite that we do roughly every 18 months, was a reminder that if the purest form of ambition and the purest and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO, that every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity, and that is dangerous because if you go to two layers and it's two orders of magnitude drop off and signal and intensity, that is a very dysfunctional organization. So what I say to the team was, it's not that you need to buffer people from the intensity of the CEO, it's that you need to absolutely mirror that intensity.

(01:06:13):
There are plenty of constituents in the business around you who will advocate for relaxing. There is an infinite supply of people under you who will buffer other team members from the intensity of the demands. Your job is not to be one of those buffers. Your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level and let the buffering happen somewhere else, and that's the point is that entropy creeps into the system insidiously and slowly over time off your radar and you have to maintain that intensity every minute of every day to try and fight it if you want to stay at the extreme right end of the power law that obviously governs the outcome of everything that we build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):
What does that look like to pass along that intensity? What does that feel like? What does that look like? So say Parker comes to you, "This bug sucks. I got this broken screen." You cut off your finger. Maybe that's the example.

(01:07:18):
Okay. Still got them. I got all 10.

Matt MacInnis (01:07:21):
I'll give you concrete examples. Actually, the joke that I sort of played on this one when I presented to the team was that the next sort of slide in my presentation was with the sound effect, the Slack huddle thing, and Parker's icon in Slack is just, he uses the generic yellow...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:42):
The egg?

Matt MacInnis (01:07:43):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:43):
Oh, wow.

Matt MacInnis (01:07:46):
It's funny, and so everybody knows the yellow egg is Parker, and so the next slide in the presentation was boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, which is the sound that Slack makes when someone calls you, and it was Parker Conrad is inviting you to a huddle, and then the next slide was Parker Conrad is modeling personal intensity, and the idea is that if you know, you know, if you've ever been dragged into an... "I want to talk about this fucking problem right now and whatever you're doing, unless it's an interview, I want you to come and have a conversation with me."

(01:08:13):
That intensity is one place where it plays out. Every product team at Rippling, and we have a lot of them now, have public feedback channels. I am in there upside down on everything I find when I use those products, and I just model for everybody that this is how at least I want to do it, which is, "I don't like this. I don't understand this. Tell me why this is this way." Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and people jump in and respond. The factory inspection process that I mentioned, which is where at the end of the assembly line, I jump out with the pickle and we talk about all of the elements. You have to record a loom of every major flow through the product. I personally review every one of those flows, I got a backlog I got to catch up on today and provide feedback to people always in a public channel so that every other product manager and engineering manager can jump in and see how the process has worked for other teams.

(01:09:01):
It's about modeling the intensity publicly so that other people can say, "Okay, this is how we do things around here," and it gives the reaction from the team that received the message that you have to inject that energy every minute of every day and that there are no exceptions, was not like, "Ooh, that's exhausting." The reaction is, "Oh, that is so invigorating." It's so wonderful to hear that we're going to achieve these great outcomes, or at least we have a shot at doing so, and that you're empowering me to follow my instinct, which is to really push for the best result.

(01:09:39):
The reaction universally is like, "Ugh, what a relief that I get to go be intense," because nobody in a position of leadership wants to be chill, and what's worse than a chill boss? No, don't work for a chill boss. Don't be a chill boss. It's the most pejorative label I could give you. Chill boss or chill PM. Don't be chill. Chill doesn't accomplish shit. Be intense. Be good, be respectful, be intense. Don't be chill.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):
Again, this advice comes from where we started, which is this is what success looks like, because somebody that is less chill than you is going to find that crack and come after your market. Is that the gist?

Matt MacInnis (01:10:21):
For sure. I mean, again, if you're chill and you move the X axis down 10 or 20 points, the Y axis collapses. It doesn't just drop 10 or 20%. The Y axis collapses, and this is just kind of true in everything we do. So yeah, if you want to win, you should probably try.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):
This is what I always say to people trying to build lifestyle businesses. There's always this idea, "I'm going to build a side business, I'm going to make recurring income, it's going to be amazing," and in my experience, anytime there's a market or something shows up that's juicy and there's ways to make money, somebody's going to come at you and work harder, raise more money, and there's only so long you can maintain that.

Matt MacInnis (01:11:04):
Well, man, there's a whole other podcast episode on the concept of leverage. If you sell your time, you've only got 24 hours a day to give, but if you can create a product that scales, the marginal cost of a unit of that product is zero like software, it's going to be competitive, man. Sell your time, it's not going to be super competitive, but achieve that level of leverage and it's a pretty efficient market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
To close out this thread of intensity and adding energy to everything, something I've heard about you is you're big on escalating. You're a big fan of escalating issues, and also you always tell people to never not give you negative feedback, to always share feedback to not hide anything. Tell me about those two.

Matt MacInnis (01:11:49):
Fundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. Who are you optimizing for when you do that? What are you optimizing for when you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable? Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort and it's fundamentally selfish. It's the most selfish thing you could possibly do, is withhold feedback that would otherwise be useful to someone because you don't want to be uncomfortable. Well, that's not how high performance teams operate. So I demand feedback, and I give it, and it doesn't mean that when I give feedback, it's not open to being questioned or discussed. I mean, of course it is, but when I observe something, I try to say it. That's the feedback topic.

(01:12:35):
The part of this that has been interesting to me is that people withhold, escalate, the customers withhold. Customers don't want to escalate to me as an executive. Even the founders in whose businesses I've invested who use Rippling are reluctant to hit me up when something goes wrong because they don't want to bother me, but it's literally my job, literally my job to find things, problems, and make them better, and by virtue of making those specific things better, to iterate on the processes so that the system that builds the system can get better.

(01:13:09):
There's no greater gift to me as a product executive than receiving an escalation from a customer. We have an escalations team at Rippling, which sounds weird, but it's people who are just particularly skilled at pistol whipping other people in the company to get to real root causes, real root causes. Not like throw away the word root cause, like, "Oh, we fixed the data error and shut the ticket down." No, you went and you found the software that created the data error, and then you found the system that created the software that created the data error, and you solved all of that back to the top.

(01:13:44):
Escalation seems extremely good at that at Rippling. So we have sort of a dedicated little team that does this for us. Escalations are a gift, and it's like, if you're a listener right now on this podcast and you are a Rippling customer and you have shit that you think we should know, the fact that I might already know it is not a reason for you to withhold the gift of your feedback. So it's an attitude that I take to this every day. I've got a little cue of some stuff that I've... Minor things that are from the last couple of days from people who had some knits and issues that I'm just like, I've got them queued up on my to do list today and I'm going to take them to the product teams directly and be like, "I'd like to understand what happened here." Not in a negative way. I just think we'll all get better if we study this one, and so yeah, escalations are a gift, feedback like that is a gift, and nobody is ever inconveniencing me when they do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
For people that are listening to this and feeling like, "Man, this is so stressful and intense and just like, I don't know if I want to work this way," give them a sense of just how successful Rippling is. I think a lot of people may not even have heard of Rippling. A lot of people are like, "Yeah, it's doing great." What are some things you can share that are public or not public that give people a sense of just how massive this business has become?

Matt MacInnis (01:14:53):
People look at Rippling from the outside, I think they think of us as payroll and HR or whatever, which is cool. It's a bit like saying Microsoft is a desktop operating system company or it's like every company starts from somewhere.

Matt MacInnis (01:15:00):
... system company or ... It's like every company starts from somewhere and grows out from there. We see ourselves as building the most successful business software platform in history. In fact, that's the mission statement of our product organization under the umbrella of the mission statement of the company, which is to free smart people to work on hard problems. And when you translate that from where we are today to where we think we're taking things, it's like we really do believe that the core of every workflow and everything that a company has to do, be it AI or manual traditional GUI based software, is who's doing stuff, who owns it, who's accountable? And so the people record is a really important component of that. You can argue that the customer record's also very important. And of course some big businesses have been built on that primitive as well, but we think the people primitive is actually much more important.

(01:15:43):
And that the only thing that hasn't been done here is somebody hasn't been ambitious enough to build a good business on top of that primitive. Workday is terrible software. Everybody agrees on that. I think Workday agrees on that. Good luck to them. But they have failed actually, despite their success, to build a really broad general purpose software platform for business software on the foundation of the people primitive. So we're going to do that.

(01:16:03):
And we're successful because we deliver on that promise at the scale we're at today. The fact that you can do ... and this is not a sales pitch or sort of like an advertisement for Rippling. I just think it's important to sort of contemplate that when you bring together a bunch of disparate business processes into one system on a common business data graph, an object graph, a data lake with a consistent interface, you can do some pretty magical things.

(01:16:27):
So we do payroll, we do HCM, we do IT, we do spend. We are about to launch a new product in the category of business intelligence and data management. And there's a whole bunch of other stuff coming beyond that. And then you layer in AI on top of this, where we alone, where we alone have all of your business data organized into this nice, neat package with a beautiful semantic layer on top of it. The AI can work magic. And we have shipped nothing, nothing yet in this category that I would say gets anywhere near what we're going to show next year. And it is going to set the standard. It is going to be the most ... The back flips that the AI is doing reading and writing data for the user just on our internal use cases at Rippling is jaw dropping. So I'm super excited about the tailwind this is going to create for us.

(01:17:20):
You ask about what can I share about the success of the company? What I can say, there are tens of thousands of companies that now run on Rippling. We're less than 1% of the market. And the market cap at 16 billion, I think now undervalues where we are from a revenue perspective by a long shot. There is just so much upside to do what we're doing. And SaaS might be dead-ish in terms of point solutions, but long live SaaS in terms of what we're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:48):
Let me follow that thread in AI. There's been a lot of talk about AI is going to replace SaaS, as you maybe just said.

Matt MacInnis (01:17:55):
Yeah. People are going to vibe code their way to their payroll system, which I ... good luck to the employees of those companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):
And so what I'm hearing here is that you actually do believe a lot of SaaS companies that are selling individual solutions are in big trouble. The answer implied here is this kind of compound startup idea of you need to do a lot of things for people for them to continue to pay for your software. Is that the gist?

Matt MacInnis (01:18:18):
No. I think the gist is ... there's a really good quote. I forget who it's attributable to, but it's, "There's two ways to make money in software, bundling and unbundling." And you just got to get the timing right. So this is a period of bundling. So here's the problem; point solutions don't have enough data in the age of AI to be useful. You got to be able to provide the AI with a lot of context about a lot of data so it can do things. It can do joins. It can do correlations.

(01:18:49):
And so if you're a point solution, you're in hard water because you've got to now rely on data from other sources. You've got to integrate to third party systems. And when you integrate to a third party system, even the best ones are still sort of drinking their data through a straw, which is a real problem. I mean, the biggest HCM software company you can think of integrates to the other biggest payroll software company you can think of through flat files via SFTP. What are they going to do? What are they going to do? It's just never going to work. It's just no way. And so I literally have no idea what they're going to do. They're just not going to build AI software, I guess. Point SaaS is sort of in a rough spot, especially when you cleave two really important systems apart and say they have to integrate. It's very, very hard.

(01:19:39):
The other thing that I would say about the world of, even just like not SaaS, but AI software is that point solutions in the AI world are also in a rough spot for the same reason. It's like if you're selling the shovels like OpenAI and Google with Gemini, you can make money. And if you own the mine, like Rippling, with the data, you can make money. If you're somewhere in the middle, building AI software that then tries to use the shovels from the shovel provider, but then also needs to rent out the mine, or get the ore out of somebody else's mind and start refining it, you're in a very difficult place from an economic standpoint. Because you're not going to be permitted by either of those parties to build a big business on their backs.

(01:20:25):
That's just not how it's going to work. They're going to demand value capture that crushes your unit economics. So I look at the landscape of AI companies that I've seen and I think you have to have a really durable, interesting insight that gives you a shot at viable unit economics to be an interesting business. And that is going to kill off 80 or 90% of the stuff that I see right now as standalone AI businesses.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):
So what I'm hearing here ... I love that you correct me when I get these things wrong, and that's exactly what I want. What I'm hearing is it's less about how difficult it is to build the SaaS product. It's about, do you have first party data that allows you to build an incredible AI product on top of what you've got?

Matt MacInnis (01:21:09):
Yep. Because look, SaaS software is a bit flipping. All SaaS software applications are bit flippers. It's an interface changing-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):
Your database?

Matt MacInnis (01:21:18):
Yeah. Changing values in your database, that's what it does. It's a really hard problem. One of Rippling's superpowers is we're a coin sorter. You dump $20,000 for an employee in the top of the coin sorter, and it figures out what goes to the government, what goes to health insurance, what goes to your 401k, what goes to you. And it has to move all that money very, very reliably and seamlessly, very challenging software to build and manage. What's it doing? Even that is just flipping bits in a database. And so AI is a new way to flip bits. AI is just a new way to flip bits. Hopefully a way that abstracts us a little bit further from having to think because our future is Wally. It's going to be great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:57):
Speaking of Wally, actually, I have this Matic Robot. You have one of these?

Matt MacInnis (01:22:04):
Uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):
No. It's like a self-driving car robot, basically, a self-driving car. People built this robot that cleans your house. Maybe I didn't mention that. It's like a house cleaning robot that just goes around.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:15):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:15):
It's like a Roomba. You should have one. They're expensive, but incredibly cool. And actually in Wally, there's a scene where they actually have basically what these things look like. So it's not so far-fetched for that movie.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:26):
I definitely was actually quite prescient, perhaps with the exception of the gravity defying day beds.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):
Yeah. I don't know, but that's not good news. You've seen that movie. Oh, man. So on this AI stuff, which I'm hearing is we're going to see a lot more consolidation where these point solution companies realize they need this data. This is existential, and they're going to combine and merge and bundle, as you described?

Matt MacInnis (01:22:51):
It's possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:52):
Or for now.

Matt MacInnis (01:22:52):
I am not an investigator on this stuff. I think there's some really interesting investors out there who I think are thinking quite deeply about this. And in particular, the conviction, which is like Mike Fornell and Sarah Guo. I think those are two investors who are hyper focused on AI. And when they made the decision to take that approach, at the time I thought that's kind of narrow. Now I'm like, no, no, no, that was the right move. And it just means that they have a very deep, deep, deep set of hypotheses that they've formed over the course of seeing every AI deal in the valley. And there are better people to ask this question of than I am. And I think if you're an entrepreneur, I recommend them to you because I think they're really smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Awesome. I love those guys. Also, Sarah and Elad have a podcast called No Priors that I'd also recommend. We'll point it to you in the show notes. So on this AI note, I guess is there anything else that you think would be really helpful for founders that are working in this space building an AI startup to hear they think you were seeing of like, here's what you need to do to win in an AI company?

Matt MacInnis (01:23:58):
So much. I actually think that if I were to give you an answer to this question right now, it would be bullshit. Yeah. I don't have anything ... Back to my point earlier, I don't have enough relevant experience in the abstract to dole out on a podcast on that topic, but I wish them luck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):
I love that. Circling back to your advice, don't ask for advice, ask for a relevant experience. And I love that that's where your mind immediately went. I'm going to take us to AI Quarter, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. And the question is just what's one way you've found AI to be useful in your work day-to-day? Is there something that you found it unlocked in how you work?

Matt MacInnis (01:24:37):
I mean, it's not a super exciting thing, but I'll say where I use ... So one of the most important functions that I perform as an executive is the synthesis of ideas, and the ability to communicate those ideas very clearly to people. So when I talk about the product quality list and the pickle, as something that we've come up with internally, I do turn to AI, ChatGPT and Gemini, where I take a really, let's say, angular view of some topic and I give ... really, I write the essay for the AI and I'm like, "Look, this is the crisp idea I want to communicate. Help me come up with pithy ways to articulate these things." And 80% of what it outputs is trash. It's just sort of middle of the road, average, low alpha junk.

(01:25:24):
But it is a thought partner, a non-judgemental thought partner where in 20% of the stuff it comes out with, I'm like, yeah, it's pretty good. That's a new word I didn't think of. That does kind of hit the nail on the head for this concept. And so if I believe that my job is to sort of bring brains along on the journey for some sort of change that I'm trying to bring about, then the most important tool is language. And I do find that the ChatGPT and Gemini do a great job of helping me refine how to articulate the concepts that I want to articulate. They are not useful in coming up with the ideas themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):
That's an awesome tip. I don't know if you've played with Claude much, but I actually find Claude is better at writing and words and language.

Matt MacInnis (01:26:05):
I have not spent a lot of time with Claude. I have used it, but by virtue of this conversation, I'll probably go give it a go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):
Right. Yeah. They're all great, but there's something about Claude that is just at writing specifically is much better, but they're all getting better all the time. There's always something new.

(01:26:23):
Matt, we've covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to touch on. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you were hoping to share or anything else you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with?

Matt MacInnis (01:26:34):
Yeah. We've spent a lot of time talking about intensity and the grind, and the need to just always be operating at the 99th percentile. And I think if you listen to that in a vacuum, it's very easy to believe that that intensity is soul crushing, that it's a negative, that it's maybe not something that you want. And I think there's a backstop for me that I didn't talk about today that I think is important to share, which is that life is amazing. That the fact that we all exist on this blue marble drifting through space and time, that we are some weird instantiation of consciousness, each of us, and that you're here for such a short period of time whittling your stick, doing something, that if you remember how insignificant we are and all of this is, it brings this levity to what we do and to the work we put into building this.

(01:27:47):
Because Silicon Valley in 2025 is Florence and the Renaissance. It's crazy. The amount of creativity and insane invention and progress that's happening for our species right now in this place is absolutely unparalleled in all human history. You've got to zoom out and appreciate that magic. And so then you turn around and you're like, fuck, I've got to work on Friday night, right? I've got to go give it my all. I've got to go compete in the arena of business.

(01:28:22):
You have to never forget that number one, none of this matters. And number two, it is an absolutely beautiful and amazing phenomenon that we get to be alive doing this right now. So play the sport, play it with everything you've got, but never forget that it's just a sport and that none of it matters. I think it's super important as a counterpoint to the intensity that we talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):
That is beautiful.

Matt MacInnis (01:28:50):
I think about Pale Blue Dot, Carl Sagan's whole thing. Just a stunning photograph that literally changed the way I think about who I am as a person when I saw it. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:02):
Well, going in a completely different direction, with that, Matt, we reached our very exciting lighting round.

Matt MacInnis (01:29:07):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:07):
All right, five questions for you. Are you ready?

Matt MacInnis (01:29:09):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Matt MacInnis (01:29:16):
Okay. Two or three books. You give me a heads-up on this. So one book is Conscious Business. I don't have Conscious Business in front of me because it's actually at the office because we have Conscious Business Reading Club at Rippling. And every member of my current, my product leadership team is going through this right now, Conscious Business, Fred Kofman. It's been used in many businesses, LinkedIn most notably, as a framework for thinking about ... effectively, it's a user manual for human beings. So if you are a leader, a manager, an executive, whatever, particularly younger people in their 20s and 30s who are just sort of getting the hang of being a CEO or a product leader for the first time, this book is absolute fucking gold. It was recommended to me by Bryan Schreier at Sequoia when he was on my board at my previous company. I took way too long to take him up on the advice, wished I had read it sooner. Highly recommend Conscious Business. Changes your life.

(01:30:01):
Number two, Thinking in Systems, Donna Meadows. I always mispronounce her name, Donella Meadows. She died partway through writing this manuscript. Her fellow professors picked it up and finished it for her. It is the best generic framework for thinking about how systems work. You will extrapolate from this book to every aspect of your life after you read it.

(01:30:23):
And then the third is classic 1960s, The Effective Executive. It's an anachronism. It uses weird pronouns for the secretary and the executive. I'll let you guess which ones. But the book itself is so chock-full of simple enduring advice on how to be effective at leading teams. And the good shit is the stuff that's been in print for 70 years, and that's one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:48):
Beautiful. I love the first one is you don't have it because you're using it with your team constantly. You mentioned at one point before we started recording, you have eight copies of that book that you just give out to everyone.

Matt MacInnis (01:30:57):
Yeah, and we handed out like candy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
Okay. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Matt MacInnis (01:31:03):
Yeah. So I'm a little embarrassed by this answer, but I'm going to be honest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:07):
Please.

Matt MacInnis (01:31:08):
There's a new series called Heated Rivalry and it's about ... I'm Canadian and I'm gay. So it's about two hockey players. In Canada, rivals between the Bruins and the Maple Leafs, although they don't use those names, who are just heated rivals on the ice. And it's a huge thing that the world is watching, but actually they're secretly in love with each other and they start hooking up. And it's been labeled by the media as smutty but delightful. And I would say that's accurate. So it might not be for everybody, but it is a smash hit right now. It's on HBO Max and Crave, and it's only six episodes. But like I said, a little embarrassing because it's a little chintzy, but it's a lot of fun. It's also really fun to see gay people represented in the media as though they're normal, and it's fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:57):
And soon to be on Netflix with the acquisition if that goes through.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:00):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):
It's crazy. Amazing. Okay. Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:06):
My Fellow coffee maker. I love my Fellow coffee maker. It's got an interface that lets you set light, medium, dark roast. It changes the temperature. It blooms the coffee. It tells you how many grams of coffee to put into the basket, slick interface, high quality coffee. It's definitely awesome. And so I have Ashley have one in the office and one at home and one in the garage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:30):
Wow. That is a favorite product. You have three of them in the same cool space.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:35):
Oh no, in the office. Okay.

Matt MacInnis (01:32:35):
Fellow is also a Rippling customer and that's a nice side effect when we get to ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:39):
Have they ever escalated anything to you?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:42):
No. If you're listening and you're from Fellow, I want to hear all your gripes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:46):
Perfect. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to often in work or in life?

Matt MacInnis (01:32:51):
It's a dark one, and I'll share this one sort of partially for the humor of it, but it's actually sometimes useful immediately. At least it's sort of a moment of smiling when it happens. The motto comes from my dad who said, "Matt, nothing's ever so bad in life that it couldn't get worse." And it's like we were going through some shit yesterday at work and we were like, "Fuck, now that happened." And I looked at the CTO and I'm like, "Dude, nothing's ever so bad that it couldn't get worse." And we had a good laugh and continued to brace for whatever might come next. So not exactly uplifting, but fun to use.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:26):
No, it is uplifting. I'm an optimist and I find myself thinking that often with my wife just like, "It could be worse. It could be worse than this. " Definitely. It's actually [inaudible 01:33:36].

Matt MacInnis (01:33:36):
And it might get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:38):
So let's enjoy this less worse version. Final question. Something you shared with me is that you were a DJ when you were a younger person. Can you just give us a little DJ voice to give people a sense of your skills?

Matt MacInnis (01:33:52):
Well, so first of all, it's not DJ, Lenny. It's radio personality. And yeah, I used to do the greatest hits of all time with hits from the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, and a little bit of the '90s, 101.5 The Hawk. Yeah. You can turn it on. It's very inauthentic, but it sounds good on the radio. It's cool. I did it when I was in high school. I ended up doing the midday segment right before I went to college. And what a gift. What a huge gift in my most formative years to have developed an ability to be in front of a microphone comfortably, because here we are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
I love for people that weren't watching this YouTube, you lean really close to the mic to get that radio personality voice.

Matt MacInnis (01:34:34):
Yeah, you got to be able to hear the saliva in the mouth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):
Incredible, and it's like the same person talking. If you're not watching this, you're like, "Where did that guy come from?" That was great. You nailed it. Matt, this was incredible. I really appreciate being here. I really appreciate you sharing all this advice that I have not heard other people share. Two final questions. Is there something you want to plug, point people to, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt MacInnis (01:34:55):
Look, my life is rippling. I point people there, and this is my life's work. It's going to be a banger, so stay tuned. And the way that you can help me is that if you're a customer, you got to tell me when you have problems, because that's how we get better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:10):
What's the way to get to you? Is there any place you want to point people to?

Matt MacInnis (01:35:13):
DM me on Twitter, is easy @stanine. You can email me my last name at rippling.com, and I'll go that far without giving out my phone number. How's that? Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:25):
A perfect boundary.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:27):
Matt, thank you so much for being here.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:29):
It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me, Lenny, and congrats on all the success with this podcast. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:34):
Same to you. It's always a good sign at the end of a conversation when you're like, oh, I got to get me some of that stock and I got to get into that Rippling.

Matt MacInnis (01:35:41):
It's a good buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:41):
A great job.

# Are your fears giving you terrible advice? | Matt Mochary

## Transcript

Matt Mochary (00:00:00):
The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on to Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera, because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You don't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. And of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. So, that's the most important thing.

Lenny (00:01:08):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my aim here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Matt Mochary. Matt is a full-time executive coach, but not just any coach. He's worked with folks like Naval, the CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, Reddit, Rippling, Fair, Front, Notion, the list goes on. He's also coached partners at VCs like Sequoia, YC, Benchmark, many others.

We are so fortunate that Matt agreed to join me on this podcast and in our conversation we cover a lot of ground. We talk about why learning to fire people is one of the most important skills as a leader and how to do it well, why anger and fear often point you in the exact opposite direction you should be going, how to innovate within a larger company, how his coaching has evolved over the years, where the most successful founders still struggle, and so much more. This may be my new favorite episode and I bet it will be years, too. So much real talk with tactics, templates, all kind of goodness. Enjoy this conversation with Matt Mochary.

Lenny (00:04:43):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Mochary (00:04:47):
Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:04:49):
I am looking forward to it even more. The way I learned about you is back in the day I read this book called The Great CEO Within, which I have right here, and I was like, holy moly, this is the most tactical, practical, useful book I've seen for leaders. I need to tell everyone about it, and I did. Then a few weeks ago, someone shared a link in my newsletter Slack community to this document that is called the Mochary Method Curriculum Document. I was like, oh my god, this is the most practical, tactical, useful document I've seen in a long time. I got to share this with everyone, and I did. Then I realized it's the same person that wrote these two things, and so I reached out to you and you kindly agreed to join me on this podcast. And so again, really appreciate you being here.

Matt Mochary (00:05:30):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:32):
Give folks a little bit of background on you who aren't so familiar with you, and just to help understand a little bit of a how you got so wise. Can you give folks just kind of a brief overview of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career, maybe some of the folks you've worked with and how you got to what you do now?

Matt Mochary (00:05:47):
Right on. I've had a very varied career. I started a company back in internet 1.0 called Totality, which was a good financial outcome. Then I went and just had fun for a long time and then I went and did social good and helped ex-convicts get and keep a job by becoming truck drivers. All that was super fun, but I realized I missed my peers and I wanted to get back into the tech world, but I didn't want to start a company because a company is a lot of work and the end result is you make a lot of money, but I didn't need money.

Matt Mochary (00:06:15):
And so I thought, how could I get in the tech world and not actually have to do the hard work? Oh, I could be a coach. I could coach people and then I just get to do the fun stuff and advise them and then they have to do the hard work. And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms.

Matt Mochary (00:07:07):
It's been a ton of fun and for me, I do things for joy and each and every one of these interactions has been massively joyful for me and the people I coach become my really close friends, so it's all very selfish on my part.

Lenny (00:07:21):
I feel you on a lot of that. I also tried to explore starting a company again and similarly decided this is way too much stress and work, what else can I do instead? And that's what led to the work I do now, which I love.

Matt Mochary (00:07:33):
Right on.

Lenny (00:07:34):
How long have you been doing this coaching?

Matt Mochary (00:07:36):
That whole process started about 10 years ago, so about 10 years.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Awesome. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and the internet and ahead of this chat I polled folks on Twitter and asked them what they would ask you if they were chatting with you, so I thought I'd start off with asking you a few those questions and then we'll dig into a few very specific topics that I'm excited to talk about. The first question comes from Leo Polovets who's a GP at Susa Ventures, and he asked, "Matt has coached some incredible founders, what are some of the most common areas where even the most successful founders still struggle?"

Matt Mochary (00:08:11):
Great question. To me, the bar is fear and how strongly do people feel fear? There are few people that I coach that just don't feel fear at all. And frankly with them, we have very tactical conversations, but they're the minority. The most feel fear to some degree, some feel it a lot, some feel it less, but when they feel it grips their mind and it prevents them from seeing... It prevents them from doing the thing that is difficult but necessary, so that's a lot of what our coaching is, me pointing out to them, hey, I think you're in fear.

Matt Mochary (00:08:55):
What happens is very early on in coaching they'll go, yeah, okay, I'm in fear. So what? I go, great. I believe that fear is actually giving you bad advice and I think you're predicting that if you do this A will happen. Well, I'm predicting that if you do that, the exact opposite will happen. So, I'll tell you what, why don't we make a bet? This is very high stakes, why don't we pick something that's lower stakes? You make a prediction, we'll see if I make the opposite and then let's bet on it. So we pick something and then we make a bet on it, and whoever wins the bet in the future gets to determine what the actions are.

Matt Mochary (00:09:31):
I've made this bet hundreds of times and so far, I've never lost. It's not because I'm magician or a genius, it's because when someone's in fear, they're gripped. They can't see reality, their brain is making very exaggerated predictions. Whereas when someone is not in fear, and I'm not because it's not my situation, I am not gripped and therefore, my brain isn't making exaggerated predictions. And so, we make this bet once I win, then all of a sudden the CEO realizes, oh my God, there's something to this, fear gives bad advice. Then after that, all I need to do is remind the person that I perceive them to be in fear. That's all it takes, and they're like, oh, okay, and then they go ahead and do the thing that they feel fear about. Then of course, later they come back to me and say, Matt, that was magical. It works so well.

Matt Mochary (00:10:23):
I mean, I'll give you examples. The most extreme is when a CEO realizes that there's a problem in the business and they haven't told their board yet and their board doesn't know, and remember, their board is their investors, and they have another round coming up, they know they're going to have to raise money in another six to 12 months. They need their current investors to participate in the upcoming round, otherwise outside investors won't. Then they say, well, what the hell do I do? I've got this problem. Do I tell my investors? And most often, the knee jerk reaction is, no, I'm not going to tell them.

Matt Mochary (00:11:01):
Then I say, "Well, I think that's fear. I think if you actually tell them, tell your investors, the exact opposite of what we think is going to happen is going to happen. You think you're going to lose their trust. I think you're going to gain their trust." And so, if we've done this fear exercise before, they do it, they share transparently with their board all the problems and say, and I'm excited to tackle these problems. Every single time that's happened, the board members have said, "This is fantastic. I love this honesty. Thank you so much. This is one of the only companies that I'm on the board of that actually is transparent and honest," and they gain trust.

Lenny (00:11:42):
I'm glad that you brought this topic up. I wanted to spend time on it. Just to double click a little bit into it, just kind of to summarize your advice here, if you feel fear, which you may not recognize you feel, the advice is: do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do, right?

Matt Mochary (00:11:57):
Generally, I mean, check with someone. Don't just randomly, I feel fear crossing the street crossing a crowded highway and then go, oh, that's fear talking. I should cross the highway anyway and then get hit by a cop. No, that's not what I mean. I don't mean physical danger, I mean things that we perceive to be danger to our egos, but that the easiest thing is just to check with somebody else who's not in fear because they will be able to see clearly when you can't.

Lenny (00:12:24):
I was working through your curriculum and you pointed out that you found a way to express to somebody that they are in fear. I think it was your wife that kind of iterated on how to give you feedback that you're in fear where you didn't get defensive, you got more fearful and angry and can you talk a bit about that?

Matt Mochary (00:12:40):
Yeah, so we iterated, I at times feel anger and I act on that anger and I don't even realize I'm in anger, so I wanted her to let me know, and so she would say, at first she said, "You're in anger," and that just made me feel accused and made me go into more anger. And then she said, "Are you in anger?" And that felt passive aggressive or indirect and that also made me go into more anger. Then finally she said, "I perceive you to be an anger." So it's an I statement and it's simply what she's perceiving. There's no judgment. That was able to punch through my anger and then I woke up and went, oh, and then I stopped and just didn't act until I was able to shift out of anger.

Lenny (00:13:25):
Awesome. And anger and fear, I think there's different pieces of advice for if you feel angry versus fear. Is that right?

Matt Mochary (00:13:32):
Yes. I mean, anger, you're just destroying and what you're doing is you're destroying relationships and so you just got to stop because you're breaking glass. Of course, you're breaking it with the people who are closest to you. They're the people who are nearest to you, which are the people you love and care about the most. They're not only people you work with, but they're the people you live with and you don't want to do that. You don't want to hurt them.

Lenny (00:13:59):
Yeah. Maybe one last question along these lines, why do we do this? Is this just we're trying to protect our ego and ourselves and we just want to do the safe thing?

Matt Mochary (00:14:06):
That's it. I mean, I just learned very recently, and this isn't written anywhere because I just learned it, someone shared with me that anger is not a base emotion. Anger is actually a cover. It's a cover for when we feel pain, and so our brain doesn't want to feel the pain, so instead it externalizes it. But the problem is it shoves that pain onto everybody else around us. The real answer here is not to have people let us know that we're in anger and then stop. The real answer is just to allow ourselves to feel the pain and it sucks by the way, it actually hurts. But then we're not... Sorry, I'm getting emotional. We're not pushing that out onto other people and I only learned this very recently and I'm just starting to practice this and I'm still not good at it, but I'm now at least sometimes not going to anger.

Lenny (00:15:02):
It's interesting how personal this advice is that it sounds like something that you deal with. It's not just like you're this coach that's just like, hey guys, here's all these problems you have. Here's how you fix stuff that you help yourself with.

Matt Mochary (00:15:15):
I'm human. Yes, and that's why I try to figure it out with me and if I can figure something out with me, then I can share it with others.

Lenny (00:15:24):
Amazing. That was a fruitful question from Leo, and we might come back to this topic.

Matt Mochary (00:15:30):
By the way, this also applies to organizations. I mean, the way that I used to get all this information about how to run organizations is I started a company, Totality, and my co-founder and I, we did a terrible job running that company. What happened was I didn't have any learnings from that which I could share with people because it was just worst practices, not best practices. But then 10 years later, I thought to myself, well, how could I have done that better? How could we have done that better?

Matt Mochary (00:15:55):
So, I picked up a book, a business book, it was High Output Management by Andy Grove. I read it and I was like, "Oh my God, here are all the answers." And then I read another book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz was like, "Oh my God, there are even more answers." I just kept reading more and more business books, and every one I read, they were just chock full of answers. But then I needed to test whether or not these really worked, so that's when I started coaching and I started testing them in companies, but I had to let the people know here, do this, but they weren't going to read a 350 page book. I had to summarize it in two pages and then share it with them, and then they did, and then they implemented it and it worked.

Matt Mochary (00:16:29):
Then I had all these summaries, and then I started to create my own summaries of little niche cases that weren't in any book that I'd read. That's where all these writings came from. Then one day, someone that I was coaching said, "Matt, you got to take all these writings. They're a book, you got to publish them." And I said, "No, I don't." My friend said, "Well, how about I do all the work? How about I take care of the editing and the publishing?" And I was like, "Okay, if you want to do that, great." That was Alex MacCaw. Others had offered before, but he was the one that actually followed through all the way to the end. That was it. That's how the book was born.

Matt Mochary (00:17:06):
But I realized also, recently, that many of my most radical ideas, I can't get anyone to test them because I'll say, "Hey, I think you should do blank." And the CEO will say, "That sounds crazy. Matt, can you point me to other examples of other people that have done this and it's worked?" And I say, "No, this is an original thought that came out of my head. No one's done it before that I know of." They're like, "Okay, well I'm not going to be the first."

Matt Mochary (00:17:33):
Then I realized I needed an organization to test my most radical ideas, and also all of my CEOs had been asking me to create software because I have a methodology and it's step one, step two, step three, and you do it in one-on-ones and then a methodology for a team meeting and then a methodology for feedback and then a methodology for every different motion in the company. It's all in Google Docs. And they said to me, "Matt, this is amazing. I love this one-on-one process. I love your team process, but I don't want to have to teach each of my reports the way you've taught me. I'd like it just being softer. I just hit a button and boom, it happens automatically." At first, I said, "No, that's not interesting to me. I'm not a developer. You, Brian Armstrong, you're a developer and you have a thousand engineers that work for you. Why don't you go create it?"

Matt Mochary (00:18:21):
But in the end, I said, "Okay, this could be fun." So, I hired a team of developers and we started to create the software, and one, the product is working. But two more importantly, I now have a team of humans that we work together that I can start testing my more radical ideas out with. I would say about half of them are wildly successful and the other half complete duds. It almost seems like one are the other. But now I have my own basically laboratory to test things. Of course, when I see radical things that other people are doing, I try them in our organization, and it's phenomenal.

Matt Mochary (00:18:59):
I'll tell you the most radical one. I was asking one CEO, I said, "Have you ever let someone go and regretted it?" He said, "No." And I said, "Well, then you don't know what the bar is because the bar of where you should be letting people go is here, and the bar that you've let people go is here. So until you get close to that line, you don't know what that line is." He said, "Wow, that's true." Then I thought about it and I thought to myself, uh-oh, I have never let anyone go that I regret it, so I don't know where the line is.

Matt Mochary (00:19:34):
Then I thought, oh no, I've got to go into my team and let someone go, and here's the problem. We've already done talent density, we've already done the Netflix thing. If someone is meeting expectation, we let them go. We've already let all those folks go. So on our team, it's only outperformers. So, I thought there was one guy, he's an outperformer, no question about it, and super positive, an amazing guy and can do anything and is happy to do everything. But there wasn't much left for him to do because everything else was being covered. I talked to my number two and said, "Can you do what you're doing and what he's doing?" And she said, "Give me two weeks," and she did. She came back and said, "Yeah, I can." So, we let him go.

Matt Mochary (00:20:19):
Now, when I let someone go, I try to do it with a massive amount of compassion because I know it's brutal. I mean, losing your spouse, your home, and your job, these are the three most traumatic things that can happen to you. When that happens, of course you go into massive fear and the brain shuts down, so I want to be there and help them through that process and actively help them find their dream job because there is a place that absolutely needs them. So, what I do is I become their agent and I say, "I want to help you discover what it is that your ideal role is, and I want to help you create it or land it." I did that with him. Turns out, what he wanted to do was go start a company and create a new product so he could just start that day one. But, the litmus for me is that everybody I've let go, I believe anyway, that I continue to be friends with. That shows me that the process by which I let people go is a humane one.

Matt Mochary (00:21:17):
Here's the crazy thing, after letting this guy go, after about 30 days, I was like, ugh, did I do the wrong thing? Was that too much? But then after about two to three months, I realized, no, that actually was the right thing because my number two was able to absorb the things that he was doing and here's the crazy part, with fewer people in the organization, things work better. That's the big realization that most people never discover. they hit product market fit, they get tons of money from investors, just higher, higher, higher, higher, but every additional human you have in your organization causes extra overhead and geometrically so, because now you have to keep all those people informed, give them all context, make them all feel heard, because unless they feel like they're contributing and you understand what they're saying, then they feel ignored and they feel passed over and they feel disrespected and grumpy.

Matt Mochary (00:22:11):
There's this morale problem that exists. There's this friction of information flow and a morale problem that grows and grows and grows. Really, the only answer is, I mean, that's why people bring me in because they're growing, growing, growing, and things are breaking. I have a system that keeps things together, but it doesn't make it perfect. It just makes it so that the company doesn't fall apart. But really the ideal is just to keep the team super small. That's what WhatsApp did, that's what Instagram did, that's what Linear is doing right now. That's what Notion has been doing for a while. Those, to me, are the real success stories.

Lenny (00:22:53):
This reminds me of a story I just listened to on Lex Fridman's podcast. They were interviewing the head of AI at Tesla, or former head of AI, and Lex was asking him, "Why did you get rid of LiDAR on your cars? Like aren't more sensors good so that you can be better at self-driving?" And he's like, "If you have LiDAR, you got to think about the supply chain and getting all those parts. You got to think about all the additional data that it brings and adds more chaos to your data, and you have to think about that. Think about if that one part is gone, everything slows down, and in theory it is better, but then all these other factors end up making it worse." Talking about how Elon's philosophy is the best part is no part. It feels like that's exactly what you're saying.

Matt Mochary (00:23:36):
That's right.

Lenny (00:23:37):
You're getting to all the stuff I want to talk about, which is awesome. So firing people, this is good. We were chatting earlier and you mentioned that this is a skill that most managers are really bad at and maybe is the most important skill to develop as a leader and as a manager. People are just bad at it. You shared a few pieces of advice there, but is there anything else that you could share about just how to get better at firing people and that skill?

Matt Mochary (00:24:03):
Yeah, the reason people are bad at this is because they think that they're hurting the person who they're letting go. I mean, how many times have I heard from someone, "Yeah, this person's not performing, but gosh, they really need this job and their mother has cancer," and whatever personal situation they're in. Wei Deng, who is the CEO of Clipboard Health, who's one of my favorite CEOs, who frankly I learn more from her than she learns from me, she shared with me her framework for making decisions, which is she separates the decision from the implementation, meaning she thinks about who is the stakeholder here that I'm solving for? And almost always in a company, you're solving for the customer. So, what would the customer want to see happen? That's the decision. Of course, the customer would want to see only the best employees and anyone who isn't a great employee, don't be there.

Matt Mochary (00:24:52):
Now the implementation is, if I do this, if I let this person go, who gets hurt? Well, the employee gets hurt. Maybe I get hurt because it's a painful conversation. Maybe the rest of the team gets hurt because they're sad that their friend is leaving. Then you look at, well, what can we do? Each person who gets hurt, what is it that they really want? Let's see if we can help them get what they really want. Well, the person let go, what do they want? They want a great job where they're actually needed and they feel fulfilled, so they enjoy what they're doing and they're actually critical to the company or organization that they're with. Right now they're not, by the way, they're not critical, clearly. So you're actually holding them back from what it is that they really want.

Matt Mochary (00:25:36):
What you do is you help them find that place that really needs the skill or the passion that they have. Yourself, what do you really want? You want to not have a difficult conversation? Well, cognitive behavior therapy, the best way to get over that is to actually have one and realize it's not that bad. Then the rest of the team, they feel sad because their teammate left. Well, here's how you solve what they really want is they want to know that... They want to release their emotions. Okay, great. Listen to them, let them share their emotions, let them share the sadness that they feel, and then it's released out of their body.

Matt Mochary (00:26:12):
Decision is one thing, implementation is completely and utterly separate. That's the same thing here in letting someone go. But if you let them go kindly and humanely, the key is, in my opinion, you become their agent, like Michael Ovitz, the CAA agent. You help them find their next job actively. Michael Ovitz is the one who reaches out to employers for his clients and says, "Hey, do you have work for my client?" That's what I mean by being agent, not by, if you need a reference from me, I'll be happy to give you reference. That's bullshit, that's passive.

Matt Mochary (00:26:50):
I'm talking about active, and it doesn't take long. Maybe one to two hours of my time reaching out to people I know saying, "Hey, I've got this great person." Oh my God, of course they're going to pay attention. Of course, they're going to react. Now you might say, well, wait a second, what if the person isn't great? What if they're a bad performer and my posit is that they're good at something. You have to find out what it is they're good at. And really what they're good at is what they're passionate about, so find out what they're passionate about and that you can recommend them for. That's what I do.

Matt Mochary (00:27:25):
I think for almost all managers that aren't good at letting go, it's because A, they've never done it, or B, they've done it badly. They didn't help the person, and that person then went off and had a very painful time and now hates that manager. But if you actively help that person, they will appreciate it. Now, there are situations when a person says, "Screw you, I don't want your help." Okay, but they still recognize that you offered.

Lenny (00:27:56):
Who's the best person at firing that comes to mind when you think of this person's really good at this?

Matt Mochary (00:28:01):
Wei Deng from Clipboard Health. She's the most compassionate.

Lenny (00:28:07):
Awesome. The framework you shared reminds me of something my manager once taught me similarly. They missed the final piece of actually being their agent and finding their next gig, but just the idea of separate the emotion and doing the thing from, if there were no feelings involved, what would you do? And then you should do that, and that might be hard.

Matt Mochary (00:28:26):
That's exactly right. By the way, this whole thing about no feelings, I do have probably two CEOs that don't feel emotions. They don't feel fear, they don't feel anger. One, in particular, feels zero emotions. I have to say, he's a machine, he's an operating machine and there's zero time between ah, this is the right thing to do and doing it. It's amazing. It's an incredibly well run company and an incredibly valuable company. So yeah, emotions typically, again, typically fear and anger are the ones that derail our brains.

Lenny (00:29:08):
It makes me think of Alex Honnold, I think is his name, the free climber, the solo dude. His amygdala doesn't quite function so he doesn't-

Matt Mochary (00:29:19):
That's right.

Lenny (00:29:21):
That's interesting. He could be a free solo climber, he could be a CEO.

Matt Mochary (00:29:25):
That's right. CEO's a little safer. The prediction for Alex is that he will at some point, unfortunately die.

Lenny (00:29:33):
Yeah. Did you see The Alpinist? Not to spoil anything.

Matt Mochary (00:29:36):
Yes.

Lenny (00:29:38):
Okay, moving on from that, I'm curious, in a remote world, does your advice change in terms of firing? It seems like everything you shared you could do easily in person or remote, but does something change when you're doing it over Zoom?

Matt Mochary (00:29:51):
No, it doesn't change at all. There is one point I didn't include, which I'll include now, is there's helping the person be their agent, but there's also allowing the person, whenever I have a difficult conversation, I start it off, "Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this." What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard because if they're aware that they're going to go into fear, they're going to go into anger, they're going to go into sadness, then they can see it coming and they go, oh, that's what it is. But if they don't see it coming, just a surprise and all of a sudden it grips their whole brain and now they're in it and they don't even know they're in it.

Matt Mochary (00:30:43):
That's the first thing I do. This is going to be a difficult conversation. Are you ready? Then I share the news. I'm letting you go, here's why. Then second, I deliver the message. The third thing is now they're feeling emotions, strong ones. Even though I warned them, they're still feeling them. Now you want them to be able to release those emotions, and so I say to them, "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" Sometimes they don't answer, but many times they do and they share with me and they let it out. That's important to allow them to let it out. Then I make them feel heard and I actively listen. That makes them realize that I'm not trying to run away from the pain that they're feeling. I'm not trying to leave them alone with it. I sit with them as they have it and then I try to help them get through it.

Lenny (00:31:47):
That's something else I wanted to chat about is the feeling heard lesson that you have for people. I'd love to just get your advice on just how to help people feel heard. It's like, oh yeah, I know that's important. I want people to feel heard. I will listen and it'll go great. But you have some very tactical advice on how to actually make people feel heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:05):
Yeah, there's sort of a few different levels of it. One way to make people feel heard is, let's assume you're talking to them because there's another way, there's an even more surface way is verbal. Sometimes what I do is I ask, if I'm in a group of people, and there's a question or a problem that we're trying to solve, instead of going around the room and hearing people's verbal opinions, which takes forever, I ask everyone at the same time to take five minutes to write down their solution. Then we all drop it in a doc and then I just read it. When I read it I say, "Thank you, Lenny." And that makes you know that I at least read it, so that's a little bit of feeling heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:40):
Second, if I want to make you feel more heard, I ask you to say it verbally and then I repeat it back to you. "Lenny, I think what I heard you say is... Is that right?" And you're like, "Yes." Or you're like, "No, not quite a little bit different." Then if it's a little bit different, I repeat it again until you say, "Yes, that's it." Now you know that I understood you.

Matt Mochary (00:33:00):
Then there's a third way which is even deeper, which is especially if you're giving me feedback, you likely don't want to hurt my feelings. So what you're doing is you're giving me the feedback, but you're couching it, you're polishing it, you're rounding the edges, you're making it softer. It's not really what you're thinking, but it's what you're willing to say. If I want to make you really feel heard, I reflect back what I imagine are the thoughts in your head. If I think you're feeling anger, I sort of think to myself, well, what would anger feel like? I cause myself to feel that anger, then what are the thoughts that appear to me? I say something to you like, "Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're off and you're thinking, screw you, Matt. How dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me? Is that close?" And you're like, "No, Matt."

Matt Mochary (00:33:49):
People either say one of two things, they say, "Yeah, that is it." Or they say "No, that's stronger than what I was thinking, but directionally that's right." What that really means is, yeah, that's what I was thinking. Almost always their thoughts are bigger than their words, but they really feel heard when I share their thoughts. Now, that's not the end of the process. I mean you actually have to then do something. Once you made them feel heard, you have to say, okay, well either I accept or don't accept this feedback and if I accept, here's what I'm going to do about it. If I don't accept, I need to explain to you why. Here's what's going on. You shared with me what's going on in your world, now let me share with you what's going on in my world. Hopefully, you can see why this thing that's going on in my world doesn't allow me to accept what it is that you shared, and hopefully now that you see what's going on in my world, your feedback changes and that's it. That's the whole process.

Lenny (00:34:45):
I'm listening to this advice and I'm like, yes, I will do this next time I'm talking to someone. I imagine people don't and they forget, and it takes time to actually learn these things. Like the firing advice you just shared, how do you actually get good at this and practice these things is like I have to work with a coach who will continue to reinforce these things? Is it follow these steps next time? Have them written down? What advice do you have for folks that are like, I want to get better at this. I want to start doing this stuff.

Matt Mochary (00:35:09):
Well, these docs are all free to the public in the curriculum. You can post them here, you can post them on Twitter, you can post the whole curriculum on Twitter, frankly, other people have. It has a step-by-step. There's a doc in there that is a step-by-step script. All you do is you read it and you follow the script in letting someone go or in making someone feel heard. My posit is once you do it one time, you're like, oh my god, that worked so well. That's the only motivation you need. And you've got the script, so you can just keep doing it. I don't think you need a coach.

Matt Mochary (00:35:42):
In fact, I remember one time I asked an investor who their best up and coming CEO was. The investor gave me a name. I was like, "Great, can I please get introduced to him? I want coach him." I reached out, the guy responded immediately. He's like, "Matt, I've read your book. I love your book. I read it three years ago. I've been implementing all the elements in our company. It's fantastic." When someone says that they know my work, they've already implemented it and it's worked, 10 out of 10 times, that person wants me to coach them. Then I said, "Great, that's fantastic. I'd love to coach you." And the guy said to me, "No, thanks." I was shocked. I was like, "Why?" He said, "Well, because it's all working. I don't have any problems. I don't think I need to be coached by you." I couldn't have heard a better answer. That, to me, is the ultimate answer. And he is right. He doesn't need me, doesn't need anyone.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I was going to ask if that's the goal of all of this writing down and systemizing is just to make yourself unnecessary.

Matt Mochary (00:36:45):
Totally.

Lenny (00:36:48):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.

Lenny (00:37:22):
If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Lenny (00:38:05):
That actually reminds me of another question a reader asked on Twitter who happened to be the one on only Ryan Hoover. He asked, "How has your approach changed in your coaching since you started?"

Matt Mochary (00:38:16):
Ryan obviously started Product Hunt and then he sold the company to AngelList, so he was part of AngelList when I went there because I was coaching Naval. What we realized coaching Naval is that Naval did not want to be CEO and he just didn't know how to get out. So, I said there's a way and I can show you, and so I did and made Naval's life 10 times better. Frankly, made AngelList 10 times better because Naval wasn't enjoying being CEO, therefore he wasn't good at it. We ended up putting someone in who did a fine job, then put someone else in who's doing an insanely good job. Now, of course, AngelList is massively valuable.

Matt Mochary (00:38:53):
Ryan was there at the time, Ryan Hoover, great guy, I love Ryan. So, what has changed since then? I think what's changed is I don't think back then I had any of this fear and anger give bad advice. I think back then it was all very tactical. It was all very high up management type stuff, which is you need to have goals and at the company level, at the department level, at the individual level, you then need to track those goals. You need to track all the agreements that people make, all the actions they say they'll do. You have to put it all in Asana. Everyone has to be able to see each other's Asana board so they can see what each other is doing. I still do that, but now I've added on this piece of oh, you're in the moment and you're feeling fear? Okay, you still got to go forward. That's sort of the big change.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I noticed that's at the top of the curriculum. Do you find that's where a lot of the biggest transformations happen, that curriculum component?

Matt Mochary (00:39:49):
Absolutely. I cause people when they first start coaching, they have to read that first. There's sort of three seminal documents: on time, top goal, and fear and anger give bad advice. On time just says, hey, we're going to start our meetings on time and you're going to show up and if you don't show up on time, you're going to let me know first. That's just because I don't want to... And by the way, I showed up two minutes late for us. That's because I was on the Google Hangout for 10 minutes. I didn't realize, I thought you were-

Lenny (00:40:21):
I'm trying to fix that bug. Every time we send an invite, there's a Google meet button there. I think I cracked it finally. Yeah, that would've been a funny podcast where I'm just sitting here starting on time and for two minutes. Hello, we're just waiting.

Matt Mochary (00:40:33):
Exactly. Second one is top goal, which is this concept from McKeown, who wrote Essentialism, which is everyone is making requests of you, but if all you do is spend all day is responding to other people's requests, you never actually march towards your own priorities. You need to A, create priorities and then set aside some amount of time each day, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours that you just work on your own priority. If you do that, you'll make massive gains. And that's true. I mean, in five minutes I can change someone's life just by having them follow that practice. Then the third one is, if you're in anger, give that advice and that's what I have people read and say, "Does this resonate with you?" If it does, we can work together and if it doesn't, we shouldn't work together. So yeah, that's kind of like the crux document of whether or not people philosophically are going to resonate with what I have to share.

Lenny (00:41:25):
The top goal piece, I'm reading a book called Make Time right now and that's a big part of it. I actually just added top goal to my calendar every day. It's not working yet. Every time I get to it, I'm like no, I'm going to just check Twitter right now. But I'm working on it.

Matt Mochary (00:41:38):
That is the hardest part. Now, what I've done is I'm similar. During my top goal time, I have somebody sit with me and they prevent me from doing anything but my top goal.

Lenny (00:41:51):
Wait, can you talk a bit more about that? Is this like a coworker? Are you just like, "I need you here for this hour every day?"

Matt Mochary (00:41:56):
Yeah, I mean it's like the same idea as a trainer in a gym. A trainer in a gym, maybe they're teaching you a little bit, but more often than not they're just forcing you to do the thing that you know need to do. But if they weren't there, you would kind of go eh and not do it. That's all this is. It's what I call an accountability partner.

Matt Mochary (00:42:15):
There's even an app now where you can go online and you can sign up and I think it costs like $5 a month and you can sign up to meet someone else and you become accountability partners to each other. It's insanely effective. I'm not the only one that has a problem focusing on tasks that I don't love that are necessary, but I don't love. Like a meeting, I could take a meeting, I could take 20 meetings, I could take 10 hours of meetings, no problem. Especially when I'm the presenter, when I'm the active one. But doing asynchronous tasks for me because so people-oriented that when there isn't another human with me, it's painful, so I just have another human with me.

Lenny (00:43:04):
I love that. And that person is doing other work, I imagine they're not just watching you full-time.

Matt Mochary (00:43:09):
No, they can do whatever they want.

Lenny (00:43:12):
Is this what you recommend to leaders and CEOs? Just have someone there for an hour. Wow.

Matt Mochary (00:43:18):
If your personality is like mine, yes, have someone there. It can be remote, it can be in person, it doesn't matter. In person's a little bit more effective.

Lenny (00:43:27):
Right, there's like a little zoom window.

Matt Mochary (00:43:28):
I have my kids do it. They love it.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I love that. There's an app I use called Centered, that app that I'm an investor in, but I use it all the time and they have this buddy feature actually where you can be paired with a buddy in real time.

Matt Mochary (00:43:40):
Yes, yes.

Lenny (00:43:42):
To close a loop on the firing piece, something I was thinking about while you were talking is there's a lot of layoffs happening right now. When you're letting go of like a thousand people, you can't really be their agent unless you've seen that happen. Do you have any advice for just like there's a large layoff how you could do this?

Matt Mochary (00:43:58):
Absolutely you can be their agent, not you personally, but they each have a manager and the manager usually has 12 reports and they're rarely letting go more than 50% at a time. That means six people that they've got to be the agent of maximum. Yes, each manager can be the agent for six people. My companies have done a lot of layoffs and here's why. Back in March of 2020, there was a chance that the world economy was imploding. Now of course, by April and May we realized that wasn't the case, that the tech world kept going, in fact, it was even flourishing.

Matt Mochary (00:44:38):
But in March of 2020, we didn't know that. And so you needed, if you were being fiscally responsible, you needed to prepare for that eventuality, so you needed pare costs. 80% of costs in any tech company is payroll, is humans. If you're going to pare costs, you actually have to let go of humans. Almost every one of my companies did. Some on the low side of 5%, some on the high side. One company that is a hotel company let go of 40% because it looked like their business was about to get obliterated and the results were crazy. Within 60 days of each layoff, the CEO reported back to me: It's insane. I don't know how this happened, but the company's now operating better. I'm not talking on a relative scale, I'm talking on an absolute scale. We're putting out more features, more code. Our NPS is up, whatever it is, whatever department is performing better. The only answer for it was we've got less people, so this coordination issue is reduced.

Matt Mochary (00:45:49):
Then now in May, June of this year, we had this huge reset of valuations where growth tech stocks dropped by 50 to 90% value and all of a sudden, which we're still in and we don't know how long this can last, it's all based on interest rates so it's likely that growth stocks will be at these valuations until interest rates come back down again, which could be two to three years. These companies now they can go raise money, but it's going to be at a big down round and down rounds are very painful. So now these companies have to make sure that they don't need to raise money in the next three years. They've got to conserve cash once again.

Matt Mochary (00:46:33):
Here we are, we're in the land of layoffs again, but this time it's different. This time these CEOs know that the company actually gets better. And the CEOs that have never done this before, I simply connect them with the CEOs who have done this before and then they get convinced like, oh man, my company will be better. And now this time, people have been even more aggressive. We've had companies that have laid off 50% of the company and the results have been frankly, phenomenal.

Matt Mochary (00:47:02):
But the key to doing it well is there has to be a humane delivery. The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You didn't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. Of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. That's the most important thing.

Matt Mochary (00:48:17):
The second thing is then later, so tactically, this is how it happens. You have an inner circle. I think that inner circle should include all managers in the company and you say, this is how much we need to let go. Here's how much each of you needs to let go. First of all, you don't say to each department head or team leader, manager, tell me who you can let go because they'll all say nobody. You actually have to give them numbers. You have to let this dollar amount go or this many people go, dollar amount is better because if you say people, then they'll just let go of the cheapest people, the most junior, and often the most junior are the ones that are actually doing the most work. You want it to be dollars because that's actually really what you're trying to save. You're trying to save dollars.

Matt Mochary (00:49:07):
So, you say you have to save this many dollars, come up with a number, they quickly come back with a number. You don't want to have department heads choose for managers because if you have a team lead and all of a sudden they're told to let go these three people, the team lead will go, that was crazy. Those are my three best people. So you want to let each manager choose and that doesn't need to take long. That could take 48 hours.

Matt Mochary (00:49:29):
Then you move to implementation. At implementation, you spend the morning and have each manager reach out to people and just Slack them say, "Hey, can I talk to you for 15 minutes?" And then they have these meetings back-to-back-to-back or as close as they can and they deliver the news, the difficult conversation that we talked about before. "It's going to be a difficult conversation. I'm letting you go. I imagine this feels crappy or feels like worse than that. This is horrible. If you're willing to share your feelings and I want to be your agent now. I don't have time to do it now, but I'd like to schedule with you another hour tomorrow, the next day whenever, so that we can go and dig in and I can help be your agent."

Matt Mochary (00:50:12):
Then, that takes the morning. By the afternoon, you've scheduled an all hands for the stay team. With the stay team, you'd tell them what had just occurred and you answer their questions. The questions are almost always around fear. Like, "Holy shit, is this going to happen to me? Did these people even get feedback that they weren't performing? Does this mean that we're dying as a company and that we're going to implode?" You have to address each one of these questions and hopefully the answer is: no, to the first one, is this going to happen to me? No, this isn't. We cut deep so that we only cut once. The people to your left and right and you, you are the state team. This is the team that we're going to building the company with going forward. It's important to be able to say that. You actually want to cut deep because cutting two times or three times creates PTSD in an organization. It's trauma one, trauma two, trauma three. Now they're like, ah, it's just going to keep happening.

Matt Mochary (00:51:10):
Then, the third piece is, and this not everybody does, if you don't do this, your company within 60 days will be performing better. If you do this, your company within two weeks will be performing better because people now, the stay team, they feel sadness, they feel anger, they feel fear. Yes, you addressed their questions in the all hands, but not fully because some people didn't even talk in the all hands.

Matt Mochary (00:51:34):
So, what you do is with each and every person on the stay team, you have a one-on-one with their manager for one hour and all the manager does is say, "I'd like to know your thoughts and feelings," and the person shares and then all the manager does is make them feel heard. I think what you're telling me is you feel sad because your three buddies are now no longer here and you feel anger because you think this is bullshit and you think why did we hire this many people if we're going to fire them? That was just irresponsible. You feel fear because you're not sure if the company's going to implode or if your job is safe. Is that right? And they're like, "Yes."

Matt Mochary (00:52:11):
It doesn't take away the emotion entirely, but it knocks it down by a good 25%, which is enough that the person won't do something rash, they won't quit, they won't stop working, they won't say bad shit to other people, and it allows them to accelerates their recovery. Within two weeks, they're now seeing how the company's operating better and morale then comes up and the company's now performing better than it was before. So, three elements.

Lenny (00:52:44):
That was thousands of dollars of advice I think, in just five to 10 minutes.

Matt Mochary (00:52:50):
That's after having probably gone through this with CEOs maybe 40 times and iterating AB testing, and what's the difference, and what works well, and what didn't work well. Yeah, I can't imagine there's somewhat out there who has advised more people through a layoff process, certainly in the tech world, than I have. I'm not saying I'm proud of that, but it just is.

Lenny (00:53:17):
What a fun place to be. As you were talking, I was thinking a little bit about Twitter and Elon and the experience that's going through right now. It feels like on the one hand, he's letting go of a lot of people, which matches kind of your advice. On the other hand, not being handled too well. I think it's emails and just a lot of random quick things. What's your perspective on this whole thing?

Matt Mochary (00:53:39):
I haven't been following it directly, so I don't know how he's implementing the layoffs or how much he's doing. Frankly, just haven't been following it at all. But here's the sad reality, even if it's handled incredibly poorly, the company ends up performing better. It just takes a little longer for people to recover, for the stay team to recover emotionally. But the worst case scenario, it's handled terribly, within two months, the company will be performing better.

Lenny (00:54:09):
Fascinating. That's actually a good segue to this last topic I wanted to touch on, which something that I think you have a lot of thoughts on is building new products within a larger company and innovating inside of a larger kind of scaled company, and especially the challenges around that. What are your thoughts on just how to do this well, how to innovate within a larger company?

Matt Mochary (00:54:30):
I can tell you the short version, but I'll tell you the long version. The long version is that this was a real problem for everyone I was coaching and I didn't know the answer. But it was obvious that YC startups were crushing and just iterating so much faster. And then I had the thought, well, why not just create your own YC startup and have it crush you but you own it? It, of course, has to really look like a YC startup. It has to have a founder mentality person as the head of the team, someone who's willing to just break glass and just won't stop until they run through the brick wall. It's actually pretty easy to find founder mentality folks. You just literally go to the YC alumni list and the ones whose startups failed, perfect, they're available and they are founder types and now they want to join a company that's actually succeeding because they realize how hard it is to create something on their own, but they still have the mentality.

Matt Mochary (00:55:24):
Then you want to keep the team really small because then they can, again, there's no buy-in required, like everyone's on the same page with the same information. We started testing that and it worked, and then I thought, well wait a second. The reason that a big company has a hard time innovating, it's because once a product is scaled, it's now got millions of users. So you have two things that you need to make sure stay true every day: the site is up and running and there's no security breach. Every time you add code, you've got to test it thoroughly to make sure it doesn't take down either one of those. The review process is insane.

Matt Mochary (00:56:06):
So now you're innovating, you're writing prototype code on new features. You can't get it approved it takes so long. That's what you're trying to decouple and you're trying to create an entity that isn't touching the core code, but you also don't want to have to go through the approval process of the product team or the head of product. That takes way too long, as well. That's why it has to be a small team that reports to outside of EPD. It can't report to the head of engineering, head of product, head of design, it can't. It's got to go outside, usually directly to the CEO. That's the only other place to report that's outside.

Matt Mochary (00:56:48):
Then I had this idea, well wait a second, there's also a brand question and so why don't you create an entirely new name for this product that isn't the core, the base business? Why don't you actually just create its own C corp? Why don't you make it so clear that this is its own entity? So I wrote this whole thing up and created its own C corp. I shared this with a few people and one CEO said to me, "Matt, this sounds radical and sounds like it could work, but is anyone actually doing this?" I thought to myself, oh shit, no, nobody's actually doing this. Nobody that I know has created new C Corps for the entities, the new products they're developing.

Matt Mochary (00:57:34):
Then 30 days later, I got in a call with Wei Deng. I told you before, I'm a huge fan, and we talked about product and I shared with her this write up. She's like, "Oh yeah, that's what I do." She said, "I created five C Corps in the last two months." I was like, "What? Someone's actually doing it." I was like, "Well, what are the results?" She's like, "They're fantastic." She goes, "The team doesn't worry about trying shit because they know that it doesn't hurt our core brand, and so they're iterating fast." And she said, "Not only do I do that, I actually have two teams, independent, working on each new product. One I have is more engineering focused, they build custom code. The other is more sort of customer relationship-focused and maybe they don't even have engineers and they build a manual solution or they use off the shelf products to build a solution, and just see which one makes more progress faster." Wow, insane. That's why, again, I have so much respect for Wei.

Lenny (00:58:36):
When I think about these ideas, I think of the NPE team at Facebook and I think it's called Area 21 at Google, which works on new ideas and I don't know if anything amazing has come out of those groups maybe, I don't know. But it feels like the missing piece, and you didn't mention this piece, is feeling like there's a huge upside if you get something. Like founders having equity of their company feels like such a motivator. I could become a billionaire if this works out, versus I'm helping my startup in some small incremental way. Is that an important piece or do you think it's not critical?

Matt Mochary (00:59:09):
I'm going to be radical here. I don't think it matters at all. I think that what really motivates people is building shit that gets used in the world. I think people will say, and they'll fight for equity and money, but in the end, that's not what actually motivates them. Because I've seen this work in companies where they don't have big equity, but they have autonomy, they have ownership, not equity ownership, ownership over decision making, ownership over creation. That's what I think people want. Amazon does this. They're not giving their people... Amazon's famous for being cheap bastards, but someone has a great idea, okay, here's 5 million bucks, go do. Amazon is definitely innovating successfully.

Lenny (01:00:02):
What about the flip side of that of not necessarily the huge upside, but the I'm staking everything on this startup, I need this to work, this is my thing, my name's on the line. I feel like that's a big motivator also for founders, like I'm not going to give up this feeling of grit. Is that important?

Matt Mochary (01:00:21):
Yeah, it's also fear. It's fear, which is like if this doesn't work, I'm screwed. Fear, frankly, is an excellent motivator. It gets people to move fast and move hard. The only problem with fear is it's also corrosive, so it eats out my insides as I go along. It makes it that I don't enjoy life, but it's highly motivated. Now, I think joy is actually even more motivating or they say it's as motivating, but it's noncorrosive, so I can last much longer if I'm doing something for joy. Fear is short term, extreme motivation. It's adrenaline. Joy is long term, consistent motivation that also allows me to look back on my life and go, wow, that was a great life. So yes, that is effective motivation, but I don't recommend putting oneself in that position to get motivated.

Lenny (01:01:14):
For companies that want to try this method that you're describing, is there a curriculum document for this approach out there?

Matt Mochary (01:01:21):
There is.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Okay, we'll link to that. Are there any other companies that are doing this well that come to mind? You mentioned Amazon, Clipboard Health.

Matt Mochary (01:01:29):
In my portfolio, I know Scale and Attentive Mobile are both doing this well. More and more companies that I coach are starting to do this because I have more and more examples of it working well, so more and more companies are then copying. I don't have other names offhand that I can share though.

Lenny (01:01:43):
What was that first company? Scale?

Matt Mochary (01:01:45):
Scale.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Cool. Is that Scale AI?

Matt Mochary (01:01:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Okay, cool. I love that. Love that founder. Maybe a last question, something that I noted just in case we had a little more time is around energy audit. This is something that you advise folks to understand what gives them energy, what zaps their energy, can you talk a bit about that?

Matt Mochary (01:02:06):
Sure. It turns out that what we're really good at is what we love and what we love is often space and time disappear when we do it. Therefore, we actually probably don't even value it because it comes so easily to us that we don't ascribe value. Whereas things that we don't love but we're good at, we often ascribe value there and other people want us to do those things because they're often creating value for the whole team or the family or the group.

Matt Mochary (01:02:39):
There are four zones I posit and I learned this from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group. I don't know where she learned it from, but almost everything that I have, I poached from somebody, but at least I tell you where I poached it from. The concept is you have four zones.

Matt Mochary (01:02:58):
Zone one is your incompetence, you're not good at it, someone's better at it than you. That's like fixing a car. You should let someone else do that.

Matt Mochary (01:03:07):
Second is your zone of competence, you're fine, you can do it fine. But so can somebody else do it fine. Like cleaning your house. Yes, you could do it, but it would take a lot of time and you're not creating that much value. You should let someone else do that.

Matt Mochary (01:03:22):
Third zone, your zone of excellence. This is something that you're uniquely good at, but you don't love it. This is the danger zone. This is likely what you're getting paid for and you're likely to getting paid a lot of money for it. Other people want you to do it. You are creating value, but it's also sucking the life force out of you and it doesn't allow you to become amazing and create massive value.

Matt Mochary (01:03:45):
Then there's your zone of genius. This is the thing you do that's uniquely good in the world and you don't even notice that you're doing it because you love it so much. The key is to go and look at your day. How do you move into the zone of genius? It's not that you figure out what it is and do more of that, it's that you figure out what it isn't and eliminate that and then naturally, you'll be drawn toward what it is that you love.

Matt Mochary (01:04:10):
What I do with the energy audit is you go through a calendar, two weeks of a calendar, a representative two weeks and you first look at all the meetings you have, but then you fill in there's time in between meetings. What were you actually doing? Take your best guess, write it in and then hour by hour, take a green marker and a red marker and each hour from Monday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM and the same thing each day for two weeks, each hour ask yourself at the end of that hour, did I have more energy or less energy?

Matt Mochary (01:04:41):
If it's more energy, you mark it green. If it's neutral or negative, you mark it red. Then, once you've done that for two weeks, you look at all the reds and say what's with the themes here? Oh, one on ones with people who are no longer by direct reports, team meetings where nothing was prepared in advance and everything was verbal. Recruiting meetings, interviews with people that we didn't end up hiring. Informational interviews from people that wanted to meet me and just know me but provide no value to me. These are all things that are energy draining.

Matt Mochary (01:05:14):
Great. Now what you do is you go through each one of them and say, one, do I need to do this at all? Does it need to be done? If the answer is no, just cancel it. Two, it needs to be done, but someone else can do it. Great, delegate it to them. Three, and this is the most common, it needs to be done and only I can do it. Great, then the question is, what would make it exquisite? Well, it's the exec team meeting. I'm the CEO, I have to be in it. Well, what would make it exquisite?

Matt Mochary (01:05:41):
You know what would be exquisite? It would be exquisite if everyone pre-prepared their update, which said how they're doing against their priorities, regular green, what they did last week, what they're going to do this week, and then they pre-route any problems they saw in the company and any proposed solution they had for those problems. If everyone did that, then we could spend the first 15 minutes of the meeting just reading, processing the decisions and we could take a three hour meeting down to a 45 minute meeting. Great, go write that up, share it with a group and say, hey gang, this is what would make this meaning exquisite for me. What do you guys think?

Matt Mochary (01:06:18):
Nine out of 10 times people look at it and go, yeah, that would be amazing because they're feeling the same way. Then you go with a new methodology and it turns out to be great. That's how you take what you do each day from a lot of energy draining things into open space or energy raising things which will then allow you to start doing more and more of the things that you love. You keep doing this energy audit repeatedly, 1, 2, 3 times until your calendar is 80% green. Once that happens, magic will occur. All of a sudden, your life will become phenomenal and you will start to create massive value. I did it. That's what happened to me.

Lenny (01:07:05):
I did that too actually, a simpler version where I just paid attention to what gave me energy and what didn't give me energy when I was on this journey post Airbnb and I thought I was wanted to start a company, I thought I wanted to do some advising and consulting and I realized none of that gives me energy, but writing interesting things that people like, that was fun. So I just kind of doubled down on that path and had no idea was going to make any money and it ended up making money and that's what I do now. So yeah, two thumbs up for this method and it's a more sophisticated version, which I like.

Matt Mochary (01:07:36):
Right on. That's also trusting that there will be, if you need to monetize, eventually you will be able to monetize, but you got to start with doing the thing you love first.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Right. Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of people on Twitter and newsletters that are just doing it because they think this is something they will enjoy and other people are doing it. But I find that with this content life, you get on this treadmill where you have to continue producing things and if you don't actually enjoy it and it's not interesting to you, you end up just building this job for yourself that is no fun at all. Extra important if you're kind of going down this path.

Lenny (01:08:19):
One quick question I had along these lines is you're talking about how you focus on yourself and your energy and what works for you or not. And I was like, do these collide with other people on your team because they maybe get energy from something you don't? But your point is that oftentimes, everyone's like, "Yes, this is good for me too. We should do this because it's going to help everybody feel better."

Matt Mochary (01:08:38):
That's exactly right. I remember one time we did this energy audit process, I did it with Henrique and Pedro from Brex and it was revolutionary for them. It caused them to change how the two of them operated together. They realized one really enjoyed the internal meetings and the other really enjoyed the external meetings, so well great, let's just do that. It changed the trajectory of the company so much so that they said, "Matt, would you please come in and do this energy audit with all of our managers?" And we did. We did a big group thing and what they found was that process also changes the trajectory of the company because for everything that you don't enjoy but needs to get done, there's someone out there that loves to do it. You just got to find out who it is, and that's what happened.

Lenny (01:09:28):
I was just talking to my mom who's a CPA and I'm like, "Do you even enjoy this job you're doing?" She's like, "I love it. I love doing taxes. It's so interesting." I'm like, I'm so happy somebody out there enjoys this. I would pay anything for someone to take this off my plate. You can charge me. Because my mom does my taxes.

Matt Mochary (01:09:44):
That's exactly right.

Lenny (01:09:45):
Matt, any final thoughts you want to share before we wrap up?

Matt Mochary (01:09:49):
This was fun. Thanks, Lenny. I appreciate this.

Lenny (01:09:52):
Super fun. I feel like a sign of a great conversation is it feels like we've been talking for maybe five minutes, but also a lifetime. Maybe we'll do this again. There's like a million other questions I'd love to get into, but until then, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Mochary (01:10:07):
Where can people find me? I don't know. Don't find me. I won't be able to respond. I get too many inbounds and I can't respond to them. In terms of people helpful to me, just read the content and use it and don't pay me to coach you. Just do it on your own because you don't need to pay me to coach you.

Lenny (01:10:28):
I love that. It's the first time someone's like, "Do not reach out. I got it all for you online." We'll link to the show notes of the doc and everything. Matt, thank you. This was incredible.

Matt Mochary (01:10:39):
Thank you, Lenny. This was great. Take care.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
If you're really open and open source, sometimes you have to stand up the bullies and you have to fight to protect your open source ideals.

Speaker 1 (00:00:05):
Please put your hands together for Matt Mullenweg.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
Matt Mullenweg has been making some questionable moves recently. There's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days. 20+ years of good sentiment burned in days. You are like a 100% beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this, a lot of people don't like you.

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:23):
If you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years. Previously, 1% of the world thought I was terrible and now I feel like it's up to four or 5%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
People that don't know what the hell's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:39):
There's a company called WP Engine. By 2018, they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. Since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit. They started using the trademark, they're offering something called WordPress. They're referred to it as like a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Why do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy?

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:58):
A lie gets around the world seven times before the truth has time to get out of bed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today my guest is Matt Mullenweg. Matt is the co-creator of WordPress, which powers 40% of websites on the internet today, including whitehouse.gov. He's also the CEO of Automatic, which is valued at over $7 billion and owns products like WordPress.com, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Gravatar, and Pocket Casts. There is a lot of drama these days around Matt and WordPress and within the open source community, so I thought I'd have Matt on to address many of the criticisms head-on that he hasn't addressed in other places and also just get the full story on what's going on. We also chat about what incepted him to spend over half his life at this point on open source and creating WordPress. Also, why products like Llama are what he calls 'fake open source' and his perspective on AI and open source. Also, how AI is actually trained on open source code and what that means for the future and his approach for deciding what companies to acquire within Automatic.

(00:02:24):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more, that's workos.com.

(00:03:42):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:51):
Great to be here, big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:54):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:01):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today we currently help over 9,000 companies including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:39):
That is very much our experience before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
We appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get $1000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:05:10):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Mullenweg (00:05:17):
Thanks, big fan and long time listener, so happy to be on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):
I'm a long time fan. I've been wanting to get you on this podcast for so long and this is such an interesting time to be chatting with you, there's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days, so it's really interesting, almost good that we waited a little bit to talk so we're going to get into a lot of that stuff. But I want to start with just what is it that you do, Matt? What are all the things you're involved in? Give people a sense of just the things you're working on.

Matt Mullenweg (00:05:44):
So first, when I was 19, I co-founded an open source project called WordPress with Mike Little and we started just blogging software, then became sort of a full site thing and then became a platform that really tons of stuff is built on and now it's kind of transitioning into this cool WASM can be embedded anywhere or run locally or make mobile apps. It's really interesting seeing WordPress used as an engine for powering things I would say don't even look like a website, which is kind of wild to me, but that's kind of the beauty of the open source people do things with that you don't expect. End up dropping out of college, moving to San Francisco and then worked at CNET for a year as project manager actually, that's how they hired me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):
I want to talk about that, but go on.

Matt Mullenweg (00:06:30):
And then had this vision where instead of downloading the software and setting up a database and everything, we made a SaaS version of WordPress. I pitched it at CNET, they didn't want to do it, so I was like, "Okay, I got to do this," so I left and started a company called Automatic. And the idea was to essentially compliment the core WordPress software with some commercial services, things that run in the cloud, like Akismet which is our machine learning AI, I guess you'd call it AI now, but anti-spam system, or Jetpack, which is iCloud for WordPress. It does the backups and the real time sync and everything like that.

(00:07:04):
So that was 19 years ago, so that's now grown to be over 1700 people in actually 90 countries so we've actually been fully distributed and remote and asynchronous from the start, which I think is one of our superpowers. I actually wasn't the CEO in the beginning, but in 2014, so I guess 11 years ago, I became CEO. The original CEO was... Well, I guess I wasn't the very beginning, but then I hired Tony Schneider from BCL, probably four or five months in.

(00:07:35):
And yeah, so that is a very full-time thing and Automatic does a lot of products, WooCommerce, which is open source Shopify, which is now half our revenue. And then we have some really cool apps so like Beeper, DayOne, Simplenote, Rocket Casts or trying to fill up your home screens with open web, open source things that are very privacy and user-centric. So running that company is definitely a full-time job. I still run WordPress.org and the WordPress project, so I'm the lead developer there and so sort of manage all those releases in the community and the directories and all the sort of things we do on WordPress.org and this cool thing called Openverse we took over Creative Commons, which is a way you can find sort open licensed images and audio and video. So basically if you notice a throughput through all these things, it's open source.

(00:08:31):
On the nights and weekends or side, a few hours a week I do some angel investing. So I've done over 100 angel investments through an entity called Audrey Capital, which is sort of, if anything's in the sort of WordPress space, I invest in it through Automatic, but if anything's a little more further afield I do it through Audrey Capital and have done some really exciting investments there, everything from name brands like Stripe and SpaceX, but also it was in the seat of Calm or a lot of home automation stuff like Ring, August, smart things. Yeah, just check out Audrey Capital, it's got some fun stuff in there. Daylight Computer, which is one I'm very excited about right now.

(00:09:11):
And I guess finally I love San Francisco, so I an a co-owner of a cool grungy jazz club in North Beach called Keys with Simon Rowe. So if Wednesday through Saturday night, you want to see some awesome live jazz, check out Keys.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:28):
Wow, okay. You said too much, I get it now. Jazz club I was not aware of, I got to check this out. It's called Keys?

Matt Mullenweg (00:09:36):
Yeah, keys Jazz Bistro.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
Okay, cool.

Matt Mullenweg (00:09:39):
It's over on Broadway in Columbus, kind of right around there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
Amazing. That was news to me. Going back to Automatic, I think people don't get the scale of this thing, so just to mirror back, if you think that even add to what you've said, 1700 people work there, 90 different countries. Also, you didn't share this stat, it was something like 43% of internet websites are built on WordPress, run on WordPress.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:02):
Yeah, so when we started, a lot of websites were built on custom CMSs and there's a lot of fragmentation in the space, but now WordPress has grown to be over 40% of all websites in the world, which is 10x the number two, which right now is Shopify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
Right, they're like at 4%. I was looking at that list.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:20):
They're around 4%, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
That's unreal.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:22):
It used to be open source was the top three. Unfortunately, Jula and Drupal have fallen behind, and so now it's like Shopify, Wix, Squarespace are the top ones but WordPress is still, because we have this flywheel of open source community, its movements, any open source like Linux or Apache or Wikipedia, it has some positive flywheel effects when it takes off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
Awesome, okay. And then there's a few other things you didn't mention, I want to get to this later, but I'll just mention now, you guys own Tumblr, you bought Tumblr, which I don't think a lot of people necessarily know.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:56):
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that, Tumblr.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:58):
We're going to get into that, yeah.

Matt Mullenweg (00:11:00):
Yeah, running a social network is definitely the hardest thing I've ever attempted. I thought we knew what we were doing because WordPress ran so much of the web, we dealt with, I thought, every content moderation thing you could ever deal with, but social networks are a whole other ballgame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
Okay, a couple more fun facts before we get into some other stuff I want to chat about. Fun fact number one is you were super involved in the Bay Lights project. I didn't know this. For people that don't know what the Bay Lights, if you're in San Francisco you definitely know what the Bay Lights project is and I'm sure you love it, for people that don't know what this is about, what is this project and how have you been involved? Why have you been instrumental in to make this a thing?

Matt Mullenweg (00:11:37):
Bay Lights, there's two famous bridges in San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, which is kind of the iconic one, there's actually the Bay Bridge, which is the workhorse of San Francisco. It's one of the busiest bridges in the country. And it's really beautiful from an engineering point of view. And so kind of a vision between Ben Davis and artist Leo Villarreal, who's an amazing light artist, actually who started Burning Man was to put, gosh, I forget the number, I think 18,000 LEDs on the side of the bridge on all the cables and create this really beautiful, gentle kind of algorithmic light piece, light art piece.

(00:12:18):
And yeah, Ben Davis was dating an artist friend of mine and we were over and having drinks on my patio and we were looking at the Bay Bridge and I had this kind of thing where there's some lights at the top of the Bay Bridge and I was like, "Oh, wouldn't it be cool if those lights were Christmas lights and they could do patterns or something?" It's the lights to keep planes from hitting it. And I was like, "Oh, you could program that." He was like, "Yeah." It was almost like the Social Network thing where a million's cool, but a billion would be really cool. He was like, "Yeah, that would be cool, but what if we put the whole side of it?" And so I was like, "Oh, cool," and sort of made an angel investment in that thing. They hadn't raised anything or had, I don't even think an entity at that point, but I was like to get you started, I forget what it was, 100 or 150k so I gave them that first bit and then it kind of blossomed into a thing.

(00:13:07):
And then sort of fast-forward, I don't remember the exact timeline, but they were kind of at a final bit of fundraise and they weren't able to close that last bit and I actually mortgaged my condos and donated the last million, million and a half to finish out that project. The Bay Lights were online for 10 years. The technology degraded, and so the environment's very harsh. So actually we just completed a fundraise and are reinstalling the Bay Lights. They're calling it Bay Lights 360. So now it'll be both sides of the bridge, it'll be visible from also Oakland and the Treasure Island because the first version, the city was very worried about the drivers seeing the lights and it might distract them so we had to angle them so that you could only see it from San Francisco, which was a compromise we didn't love because we love the East Bay and everything else like that too. So new version is coming online hopefully later this year in the fall. And also that turned into a nonprofit called Illuminate, which I'm on the board of run by Ben Davis, who I mentioned previously, that does cool public art stuff around the city. So they're responsible for the Grace Lights, all the JFK Boulevard stuff where that has some murals and the beer garden and all the chairs, that's all Illuminate. So their thing is radical public art. So it's like art that needs to be free and accessible. And I think that's so important for San Francisco. We have great institutions know the SF, MoMA, the Opera, etc, that have huge budgets like 100 million a year and Illuminate literally one 10th of that has created something that millions of people can enjoy.

(00:14:40):
And I like to think that anyone along the Embarcadero, you might be going through a tough time, obviously we have people who are struggling with mental health and homelessness and everything like that, but maybe seeing a little bit of art can help raise your soul a little bit. And that's how I think about philanthropy as well. You need to work on the base issues, the fundamentals at the bottom of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and then you also have to work on the things that raise your soul a little bit, so arts. So I like that barbell approach to philanthropy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):
Elon has a great quote along those lines, "You can't just work on solving problems all day, you need something inspiring to think about and to work towards." First of all, thank you for doing this. If you live in SF, you're like, this makes the city better, just having this around. I didn't realize you were involved in helping come up with the idea itself. I know that you did mortgaged your house to make it possible.

Matt Mullenweg (00:15:32):
I can't take any credit for the idea, I was exposed to it. I had an adjacent idea and they had a way cooler one with a real artist and everything like that. So I was just happy to be there. It's like being an angel investor, you can support the entrepreneurs and the people who truly do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:49):
Yeah, okay. And the other funny thing you said is about they were worried about the angle of the lights distracting people. What's funny is when I drive across the bridge, you can only see it when you're driving towards San Francisco looking backwards. So I'm looking in my rearview mirror or in the mirror turning around to the kind and it feels more dangerous, the lights shining in my face.

Matt Mullenweg (00:16:07):
They call it impossible works of art. There were like 13 agencies that had to sign off, they were worried the lights would distract birds or seals or environmental reviews, and it was really a lot of public bureaucrats and to make that happen, there was 20 places where someone could have said no and it never would happen. So it's very inspiring to see the city come together.

(00:16:31):
Also in San Francisco, I feel like is entering new chapter right now, going from the doom loop to the boom loop. I'm a big believer in the city. So much innovation has come here from food, the burrito, fortune cookies, all these sorts of things are from San Francisco to obviously all the tech innovation that we're all familiar with. It's kind of the city of the future and I don't know what it is in the water from the '60s until now, cultural innovations, things that happen and influenced the whole world, Burning Man, Grateful Dead, et cetera. That all starts in San Francisco. So it's exciting to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:03):
Let's set the so back, as they say on Twitter. Okay, someone very close to you told me that you're an excellent rapper. I'm not going to ask you to rap, but if you ever want to answer any questions in rap form, feel free.

Matt Mullenweg (00:17:17):
Oh man, that would be fun. I've dreamed about being able to do a Q&A and rhyme, but I don't think I'm that talented.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:26):
Planting the seed, I'm planting the seed. So I want to get into all the drama there in this world and right now, but I want to first lay the foundation of how you got into this and where this all came from. So let's talk about just the origin story of you and open source. More than half of your life, you've been working on open source, you've been working on WordPress, specifically WordPress is such a core community within the open source. What was kind of the origin story of you becoming obsessed and, I don't know, open source-pilled?

Matt Mullenweg (00:17:56):
I was a broke kid in Houston, Texas, and my passions were jazz. Houston has actually amazing music programs in the public schools, and so I was very fortunate to go to some of the best civil arts programs, including my high school called the High School for Performing and Visual Arts, where Beyoncé went, Robert Glasper, amazing folks went there. And so music was a big part of my life, and actually economics. So I had this fun teacher, Scott Roman, who participated in our school in the Federal Reserve Challenge, which was run by the Federal Reserve that sets the interest rates and backs the national banking system and everything like that, has this competition for high school students. It ended up being the first academic competition this art school ever won. And yeah, first year we kind of didn't get that far, second year we went all the way to nationals so I got to meet Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke was our judge, went to DC. So that was very, very exciting.

(00:19:01):
And so being exposed to us having a great liberal arts education, the ideas of Frederick Hayek, Agnes Smith, Alexander Hamilton, Ben Franklin, Thucydides, all these sorts of things, that philosophy really influenced me. And combine that with that, music lessons were expensive, so we couldn't really afford them, so I would barter and trade. I'd build websites for local musicians and exchange for lessons. So these websites, I would start to put software on forums or different things and that kind of exposed me to open source. So my father was also an engineer, he worked for oil companies and things, but his world was all Microsoft, it was all proprietary. And I always kind of grew up in early days of the internet, so was Slashdots and Jeffrey Zeldman talked about web standards and all these things are really kind of the social milieu and zeitgeist that I grew up in.

(00:19:56):
So combining all this philosophy I studied, it felt that open source was actually the most important idea of our generation. If the founding fathers were around today, I think they would be open source advocates. If you think about it as more and more of our lives are influenced and actually controlled by the software we use, if we don't have fundamental freedoms attached to that software, we're not truly free.

(00:20:24):
So WordPress is under license called the GPL, which has four freedoms, the freedom to use the software for any purpose, so we can use it for anything, whether I agree with you or not, the terms of service is you could do whatever you want with it. The freedom to see how the software works, open up the hood, see how it works, see every line of code, you can audit it. The freedom to change it is the third freedom. And then finally the freedom to redistribute those changes so you can share them. And the GPL has a fun little hack where if you share them, you have to provide those same freedoms to who you share it with. So it's called a viral open source license as opposed to the MIT license or some of the others that aren't.

(00:21:03):
So yeah, just kind of decided that this was what I was going to devote my life to. And so that became getting involved with some early open source projects, WordPress was actually a fork of abandoned open source project called B2. So the code base actually started was something that was already out there that I was a user and contributor to kind of volunteer on the forums and contribute code. And then when it was abandoned, myself and Mike were one of four or five different forks that started that, picked it up and tried to continue it for our own use and then later for our larger community.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):
It feels like a lot of people are coming around to exactly your worldview in, say, I was just watching a video of Jack Dorsey talking about how we're just controlled by algorithms and we don't know how they work and we are not in control of our lives. Have you seen that video?

Matt Mullenweg (00:21:52):
No, but I actually love that. Also, some people who maybe made their first billion or whatever from proprietary software then come back and it's so cool to see folks like Marc Andreessen or Bill Gurley be huge advocates for open source. I actually remember one of my early meetings with Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen. I didn't realize that at the time, Tony Schneider and I were sort fundraising and Marc really grilled us, he's like, "How can you build a business on open source? How can you be remote and distributed? Look around Silicon Valley, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, every great company has had an office. How are you going to build something that can change the internet with people all around the world?" And just had this long hour long debate and we walked out of that, I was like, "Wow, that was the worst meeting ever. They just hate everything we're doing."

(00:22:48):
And then the next day they were like, "Hey, we're interested." I was like, "What happened?" I didn't realize that he had this idea where he wanted to attack the ideas and see how we defended it was how they battle tested things. I guess kind of like a Microsoft culture or whatever where you really grill the idea, I just wasn't familiar with that. But it's so cool now that some of these folks that I've learned so much from are such good advocates for open source.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
Yeah, it's so interesting. I just had the Community Notes team on the podcast, and that's an amazing example of open source, Meta is adopting it from Twitter/X. Speaking of open source, one of the interesting, maybe most common ways people hear about open source these days is AI and AI models, and there's a couple areas here, one is you wrote this really interesting post where you talk about how Meta talks about Llama as an open source project, but you called it a false prophet. What is it about Llama that isn't open source? What are people missing when they see Llama and they're like, "Oh, Meta is amazing open sourcing everything."

Matt Mullenweg (00:23:52):
Llama, you can obviously download and run locally and all these sorts of things, right? You don't have to use their SaaS service. However, there's a clause in it that says if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users...

Matt Mullenweg (00:24:00):
... as if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users. I forget what it is. It's big. It's like 750 million, so it's pretty high. You need a license from them. And so that does not give you the freedom to use the software for any purpose. If at some point you have to ask for permission, you're kind of at the whims of this company who you might be aligned with or you might be an enemy with. And also, how do you define that? So, for example, on WordPress, our products don't have 750 million monthly active registered users, but we reach billions of people per month in terms of visitors. So, is that defined? So, there's just ambiguity there. So, I still think what they've done is amazing and I like that they're releasing it. I was very confused for why they insist on calling it open source because they...

(00:24:54):
Actually, Meta has been a huge open source contributor. React. They've had incredible improvements to the PHP engine, which we benefit from a lot. So, they're actually a big open source contributor. I think Mark Zuckerberg really understands and loves open source too. My best guess now, I don't have any inside information here, but I think they're calling it open source because there's some European regulation about open source versus proprietary AI models. So, I think it might be a weird regulatory thing because clearly they understand this isn't open source. When I wrote the blog post, I was just kind of confused, and thought, "Oh, maybe if I get this message out there, they'll change." And then when they didn't, I was like, "Oh, there must be something else going on. I think it might be this regulatory thing." We were actually a big part of, actually many, many years ago, I think it was React that they were doing something with a licensing or a patent restriction on, and the WordPress community actually got Meta to change that and reverse something they were doing to lock it down.

(00:25:53):
So, I consider my role as an open source advocate to actually be my primary thing. And it's very much my life mission. I hope to work on WordPress the rest of my life, but also just open source in general. I also support Drupal and Joomla. Anything else that's open source, I'm going to be a supporter of because I think when people choose that versus proprietary software, we're increasing the freedom and liberty in the world. It's incumbent on us to make open source, to make a better user experience, to make a better product so that people choose it, and then the world becomes more free, not less free.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
It also feels it's important to you to, I don't know, white open source washing, like avoid people using the term when it's not true. And it's interesting in this case, that the thing that makes it not truly open source is the limit. There's a limit where you can no longer use it the way you want. Is that the issue?

Matt Mullenweg (00:26:53):
Yeah. And there's actually an open source OSI. There's a formal definition for what makes an open source license. And there's actually many dozens of open source licenses, and sort of public domain licenses and other things. So, it's also their stance that this is not an open source license.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):
Something else that I think is really interesting when it comes to AI and open source, you wrote about this and it blew my mind, such a good point, that the code that these models were trained on was open source code because that's all they have access to. They don't have Windows code, they don't have Shopify code. And what a cool, I don't know, another success story slash... I don't know. I guess, how do you feel about that, that all these AI models are trained on code you wrote in open source community?

Matt Mullenweg (00:27:43):
That's beautiful. It's one of the safest things to train on, right, because the license of open source very explicitly allows that. I also like to think about I have some window where my creative output is useful to society. And if you fast forward like 50 or 100, I do believe that the utility for proprietary software eventually approaches zero. When we're sending people to Mars, the operating system of the rockets and the devices and everything like that is not going to be built on the Windows NT kernel, as amazing feat of engineering that that proprietary kernel is. It's going to be built on an open source kernel, Linux or BSD or something like that. And so if you want to be part of something that sort of becomes the fabric of humanity's foundation, like things that allows a Cambrian explosion of things built on top of it, a renaissance of ideas, you want to be involved with open source.

(00:28:38):
And so I really hope that more and more people... I'm a little bit of an evangelist here. I'm a missionary, where I really want to encourage more and more people to consider at least making part of their time, even if just a few hours a week, contributing to open source because you could be part of something that is a huge impact. And it's fun, especially if you're a younger developer or designer or PM or whatever, you can't walk up to Facebook and change your home page or say, "I'd like to change this feature," but you could come to an open source project, some of which have hundreds of millions of users. You could go to WordPress or, gosh, Bitcoin.

(00:29:20):
Or there's all these things are open source, Chromium, Firefox, and you could actually change a feature or project management things or change the design or improve it. And that's I think really, really special. And sort of the thrill for me of knowing that code I wrote is now executing millions of times per seconds and millions of servers around the world, that kind of thrill, that high is, when I first had my first open source contribution, such a thrill. And I've been sort of chasing that and enjoying that ever since.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Say someone wants to actually do this, where do they go? How do they do this? Do they just pick up a project, go to WordPress. org and here's how you contribute? What's a next step there?

Matt Mullenweg (00:30:03):
Yeah, pick a project that you use or like. That's obviously a nice one. For WordPress, we have this... It's called make.WordPress.org. That's where we make WordPress. And there's different groups, there's accessibility, there's design, there's the core code, there's plugins, there's all sorts of ways. So, really whatever your talent is, there's people who translate, there's people who do support, there's people who write documentation, there's people who organize events, so whatever you feel like your talent in the world is either that you have or that you want to cultivate. I learned how to code while building WordPress basically. I didn't have too much formal training there. So, it's a great way to [inaudible 00:30:48] your skills as well, and work with some of the best developers and others in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):
This also made me think about AI agents are coming around, Devin and all these AI driven coding agents. Do you have a prediction at when most of the code contributed to the open source projects will be Devin and AI agents such type projects?

Matt Mullenweg (00:31:10):
I think Google talked about 25% of their code or characters committed are now sort of AI-assisted, and they're probably on the bleeding edge. I don't know how much of WordPress's code right now is AI-assisted or something like that. But I think over the next five years it definitely approaches maybe a majority. And I'm actually very, very excited, so one of the big challenges that we have as a very open platform is we have this open plugin and theme architecture, so the 60,000 plugins and themes and the way WordPress works is these plugins and themes can modify every single part of the code, so you can really customize everything. However, many of these plugins and themes don't have the same sort of robust security and review process that core has. So, that's where when you hear about security issues with WordPress, it's very rarely in core anymore.

(00:32:03):
We haven't had a remote exploit, knock on wood, it's like I think five or six years or something, but in the plugins it can be somewhat more frequent. And so one thing I'm very, very excited about the next year or two is actually more automated scanning because obviously that code basis is so many tens of millions, maybe over 100 million lines of code at this point. It's impossible for humans to review that, so we kind of rely on developers to review that and manage. And of course, we have bug bounties and everything do that, so when things get reported, we fix it quickly. But I can't wait for more automated scanning there, and I think that could vastly upgrade the security of open source. The other thing that's really exciting is right now you see people building apps and stuff and it's just sort of custom generated code, but I think the next generation of these models or sort of the next layer there is because...

(00:32:54):
As everyone knows, just writing the code is just one part of it. It's maintaining it that really becomes the life cycle of it. And Stewart Brand's new book is all about maintenance, which I'm very excited about. He's publishing, I think, with Strike. And it's actually kind of open source. He's open sourcing the book, so you can see it being written online. But anyway, to go back, I think that if... And they're starting to do that, is when the open source models you say like, "Hey, build me a website." It actually installs WordPress, and then builds on top of that, and then customizes on top of that. Then you get for free that core engine that's always being audited and updated and getting passkey support or whatever the new things are sort of continuously. And then your custom stuff can be on top of that, which I think is actually a lot more powerful than building something proprietary or custom from the ground up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:43):
I love this book concept about maintenance. My sister's partner has this quote that I've always come back to, "Life is maintenance." You basically... Everything you acquire and deal with... You get a generator for your house, you have to maintain that forever now. You get this backpack, okay, now you have to maintain this thing, keep it nice, nice jacket. Everything is maintenance. Everything in your life is just maintenance. And I wonder if that's what the book's about.

Matt Mullenweg (00:34:09):
Well, that's why I think technical debt is one of the most interesting concepts. There's so many companies as well that maybe have big market caps, but I feel like they might have billions or tens of billions of dollars of technical debt. You can see in the interface or how their products integrate with themselves through things. And I think about that a lot in our own company. We definitely have some products, almost a little embarrassed coming on because you have such great product people. And we have some variable quality around some of our things right now. If you check out Gravatar right now, I'm actually really proud of it. It's I think a really great user experience, very slick. But there's parts of... Well, I always say, "I'm the unhappiest WordPress user in the world," so there's parts of WordPress and WordPress.com that I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of.

(00:34:52):
We have a really large surface area that we cover with relatively few people, and so there's some parts we haven't looked at in a little while that we need to get around to. And it's a big focus for us this year, is actually kind of going back to basics, back to core, and improving all of those kind of nooks and crannies of the user experience, and also ruthlessly editing and cutting as much as possible, because we just launched a lot of stuff over the past 21 years that maybe is not as relevant today or it doesn't need to be there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
That sounds like excellent work for this AI agent of the future that's coming soon. There's one other area I want to mine and that's community, community building, building this ecosystem that you've created around WordPress. It might be one of the most successful, biggest communities on the internet. I'm curious just what lessons you've learned about what it takes to build a successful community, online especially.

Matt Mullenweg (00:35:48):
This is probably influenced by economics and jazz. And economics is all about systems thinking. And what are the incentive structures of how you set something up? And then in jazz is all about collaboration. So, if there's something unique I have for your audience, I would say it's don't just build a product, build a movement. And to the extent that we've been successful, I think it's that we give people something to believe in, a philosophy, a worldview. Even silly things, like we had this tagline in the footer of the WordPress.org when we started, it's still there, it says, "Code is poetry." This idea that we're not just writing code, we're trying to create something that can have elements. We name every WordPress release after a jazz musician for the past 60 releases or so. So, those sorts of things bring a little art and soul and some fun into it as well.

(00:36:44):
It doesn't have to be serious all the time. I think they can give something to believe in and work on and aim towards that's more than just a paycheck or more than just the utility, the base utility of the software. So, it's not just the software, it's also like: how are the meetups? How are people getting together? What events are you running? Are there forums? How do people contribute? Is there office hours or town halls? I do a lot of Q&A. So, what are the things you're doing around the software that's allowing people to get involved, that's inviting contributions, that's allowing people to build on top of it? I've studied platforms quite a bit like Microsoft and others, so our whole ecosystem of plugins and themes is part of what's made WordPress so successful, and the moat that we have.

(00:37:33):
The core features of a CMS, you can kind of write with a few developers in a few weeks or something. It's not... It's basically CRUD operations, but to replicate those 60,000 plugins and themes, gosh, no one's done it. That's a huge moat. And proprietary services can create platforms. Shopify has a third-party ecosystem and things like that, but it's never a true platform. And a true platform, it's when your ecosystem makes more money than the core does. And so many times, whether it was the Facebook platform, I'm putting that in air quotes, or the Shopify platform, companies build on it and then they get the rug pulled out from under them because they're too successful.

(00:38:15):
And then the sort of thing you're building on decides, "Oh, we want that money or we want that growth." And they sort of change the API or remove your access. There's so many examples of this, especially on, I think, Facebook and Shopify and others, where people got too successful and all of a sudden they knock on the door and they say, "Oh, that's a mighty nice app you have there. I'd love to offer you some warrants where we own a bunch of your company or we're going to shut it off," or those sorts of things.

(00:38:42):
And again, you don't have freedom unless you're building on open source. That's why more and more companies and people are choosing... If they're going to build a business on top of something else, if you build it on an open source, you have that guarantee. Even if I grew devil horns and became evil and automatic decided to know whatever, WordPress would still belong just as much to you as it would to me. People can fork the code. They can still own it. They can still build on top of it. So, those things I think are really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):
What a segue to all of this drama that's swirling around you these days. I think a lot of people do feel like there's devil horns that have appeared, and so I'm excited to dig into this stuff. I find that every time you go on a podcast these days, if we don't get into this, everyone's just like, "Why is Matt not answering these questions?" Let's get into the hard stuff. So, I'm going to ask you some hard questions. For people that don't know what the hell's going on, they're like, "What are you even talking about?" or just have a sense something is swirling with WordPress and, Matt, I don't know what's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?

Matt Mullenweg (00:39:48):
So ,to set it, you can get WordPress from WordPress.com or us, but also you can get WordPress from dozens of other hosts. The biggest in the world are like GoDaddy, Hostinger, Newfold. It's not the biggest, but it is in the top 10 or something. It has about 700,000 WordPress installs. There's a company called WP Engine. In 2019, WP Engine started as very WordPress oriented and they contributed a lot to the community and everything like that. They were very respectful about distinguishing themselves from core, so people really realized it wasn't officially associated and everything. But in 2019 they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. And anyone who follows business, when private equity buys something, there's some the good ones, but there's also many, many stories about how they can really hollow things out, really optimize our profits, become user hostile.

(00:40:45):
Actually recently read a story where one of the reasons there was a shortage of firetrucks these LA fires was that the fire truck manufacturers have been rolled up by a private equity firm, and they've been raising prices and their supply constraint and things like that. So, there's literally a shortage in firetrucks right now because of private equity. And of course, if you look at healthcare or other things, there's so many examples of where private equity can really, I think, be one of the darker parts of capitalism. So, since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit, and they really stopped contributing to core and they started using the trademark in a way that was very confusing in the marketplace. And particularly in the past year, year and a half or so, we're just getting lot... I get a lot of support for requests for WP Engine.

(00:41:36):
And when we do surveys, we'd find that 20, 30, 40% of people thought they were officially associated because how they were using our logo and presenting the brand and everything like that was very confusing to people. And as you know, if you don't protect a trademark, you lose it. And also the version of WordPress that they were offering actually wasn't our core vision of the functionality of WordPress. So to save money, they were actually turning off features like revisions. So, a cool part about WordPress that... actually one of my favorite features, is every change to every single post or page is saved forever, just like Wikipedia. So, if you make a mistake, you can always undo it. And of course, as building a great product, that sort of user safety of an undo is so critical.

(00:42:19):
Now, obviously you have to store these revisions, so it takes up more database space. Now, it's trivial, it's megabytes, so on modern databases is not that big a deal. But to save money, they actually turned us off, so they broke the undo feature in WordPress to essentially save money. And so you have this thing where they're offering something called WordPress. I think I refer to it as a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand, and then also people think it's official. So, even close friends of mine were like, "Oh yeah, I signed up for this thing. I thought I was supporting you."

(00:42:49):
And it's came to a head. So, past 18 months they've also... We contacted them and said, "Hey, you need a trademark license or something if you're going to use this or change how you're doing things," and tried to negotiate something and had many different term sheets over the months offered and different things, and they just kept stretching it out. And I was like, "What's going on here?" And I think part of what was going on is last year they tried to sell the company. So, private equity usually holds things for five to seven years, so they were kind of five years into this. They tried to shop it around and sell it. They weren't able to find a buyer.

(00:43:25):
They said, "Well, they don't have any IP, and it feels like they're using your trademark, so they're going to have trouble with you. They don't have a license and things like that." So, while they were negotiating with us, it appears they were also preparing this lawsuit against us. So again, I've been very fortunate in my business career that we've invested in dozens of companies, we've acquired lots of things, by and large, 99% of the time people I've dealt with in business have been ethical, straightforward, honest. I haven't really faced any baldfaced lying or duplicitous behavior. Very, very rarely people who just say one thing and do another or are fraudulent in their behavior, but I think that was happening here.

(00:44:17):
And so I also just wasn't prepared for it. I was thinking I was a little naive and kind of didn't realize what was going on for a while. So, it came to a head, and at WordCamp US in September, I was like, "Okay, well, if you're still not going to even agree to negotiate, I'm going to give this presentation about how I think both private equity has messed up a lot of open source projects in the past, and how in particular, [inaudible 00:44:46] has done some very bad or evil things." And they were like, "Okay, go for it." So, I did the presentation. I think it was on a Thursday or a Friday. Kind of spicy. People were like, "Oh, can't believe he did that."

(00:45:00):
And then on Monday they launched this with Quinn Emanuel, which is kind of the baddest, nastiest law firm, it's like who Elon uses when he sues people, launched this big multimillion dollar lawsuit against both me personally and WordPress.org, so the WordPress community and Automattic. And also they're spending millions of dollars a month on both lawyers and PR. So, they're doing... If you read... Oh gosh, who was the celebrity that they were recently talking about this, like dark PR stuff where they're boosting things on social networks?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
Oh, Blake Lively and-

Matt Mullenweg (00:45:37):
Blake Lively, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):
... the other guy.

Matt Mullenweg (00:45:38):
So, all that stuff is happening, so there's... And I warned people. I think in the presentation I say, "Hey, there's going to be a smear campaign against me." And internally in the company, I was like, "Hey, they're going to dig up everything that's ever happens. Anything bad anyone's ever said to me is going to all of a sudden become a news item." And that has happened. It's been true. So, right now there is a portion of the internet that does think I have devil horns and everything. Fortunately, this is not my first rodeo. I know a lot of people think like, "Oh, Matt was nice for 20 years, and then got mean." But one thing, if you're really open and open source, sometimes you have to stand up the bullies, and you have to fight to protect your open source ideals.

(00:46:19):
Otherwise people could take advantage of it in a way that ultimately can destroy everything you've created. So, this is probably the fourth time the internet has decided I'm the main character or really evil. And the previous ones we don't remember anymore. It's Hot Nacho or the Easter Massacre of Themes or these are the things that aren't even on my Wikipedia page anymore, but those seemed like really big deals at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
Those are your incidents. Those weren't like historical battles.

Matt Mullenweg (00:46:46):
No, no, these are things that, yeah, I was involved in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):
Cool names at least.

Matt Mullenweg (00:46:49):
Including some things I had screwed up, like Hot Nacho was definitely a screw-up on my end very early in the WordPress side, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:55):
Wow. Okay, I'm not going to follow those threads, but those are great names.

(00:47:59):
So, you mentioned this talk you gave at WordCamp, and you said at the beginning of the talk, like, "I'm-"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
... at WordCamp, and you said at the beginning of the talk... oh no, afterwards you were like, "I was really nervous to give this talk," and obviously you can see why. Just what finally convinced you this was time? Was it just to go, as you described, scorched earth nuclear? Was it like WordCamp is coming up and this is the moment to go public with this? Was there something else that kind of crossed the line?

Matt Mullenweg (00:48:24):
It was a unique opportunity because we were essentially saying that, hey, WP Engine isn't going to be allowed to sponsor WordCamps anymore. They're not going to be a... Because we had, again, up to that point really done everything to bring them in and have to be part of the community. So I really had to also explain to our community, hey, why we're going to be excluding this company that a lot of people saw as doing good. If you go to the WP Engine website, they have whole pages about how much they contribute and give back and how they... they do kind of greenwash or open source wash a lot of what they do. So all their marketing branding was around this positive stuff, and so I was like, "Hey, we need to just explain this case."

(00:49:03):
But yeah, again, my defaults and how we've worked with, by the way, every other company in the WordPress space, many of which are much, much larger and make sometimes billions more in revenue than WP Engine, is collaborative. So if there's a trademark violation, usually it's not even lawyers get involved. It's just like there's a email, we have a conversation, we do a call, we talk about it. That's how things get resolved and that's my default. I'm a lover, not a fighter, and that's why this thing doesn't happen very often. I like to say that, yes, if WordPress community or whatever was doing this like every year or every couple months, yeah, you should worry about it, but it kind of happens every like 10 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:46):
So if I could mirror back the issues that you ran into, and I want to go through this a little bit more, the problems you had with WP Engine in this case. One is they were using the trademark both WordPress and WooCommerce without license, and they're just abusing it, confusing people. A lot of people thought WP Engine was actually Automattic and WordPress official. They weren't contributing to the project. They were just making basically a bunch of money and not doing the work off this company they bought and they're just kind of hollowing it out as you described. And then they're also cutting corners, making the product worse, and that kind of reflects on the whole brand of WordPress.

Matt Mullenweg (00:50:22):
That's a great summary, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
Awesome. I'm curious just which of those three, or is it something even else that most bothered you about this? What's just like, "This is the thing that's eating me"? If I had to guess, it'd be damaging the legacy potentially of this thing you've worked on for most of your life. Maybe it's that, maybe it's just taking advantage of the community. What's the thing that you think is the root of this, just like, "Just this needs to stop"?

Matt Mullenweg (00:50:50):
Well, I guess the one thing I'd add to your list was as this was happening they were pretending to good faith negotiate. And in fact, at one point the executive, we were talking about her joining Automattic and running WordPress out of Oregon and when she thought... the VP and she going to sell, she was thinking about what was next. So yeah, a lot of this stuff was, I think that duplicitous behavior also kind of forced us to an edge more than even those other things that you mentioned. There's lots of companies that don't contribute back and it's not as big a deal. But yeah, the legal issue was definitely the trademark thing. So what pushed it to the edge? I think just the magnitude of the issue. They would refer to themselves as WordPress Engine in client meetings and other things. They were very cavalier about how they would imply their association with the project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
Obviously, as you can tell on socials, a lot of people are just really upset and a lot of people blame you. There's just, like I said, every time you're on a podcast or on Twitter, people are just like, "Matt, what about this? Why this sucks? Why are you doing this?" And I want to go through some of those things, but just not many people go through... I think you were like a hundred percent beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this... a lot of people don't like you. Just as a human, just what is that? How do you work through that? How do you deal with that? What's that been like?

Matt Mullenweg (00:52:17):
If you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years, and when we introduced something like Gutenberg, people hated it. Actually when we introduced a visual editor, people hated it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):
You've had practice.

Matt Mullenweg (00:52:30):
These are huge controversies in the WordPress history. There actually hasn't been a fork or WordPress around all this latest stuff, but there was when we introduced Gutenberg. It's one called ClassicPress where people actually forked the software. So how I would describe it is previously like 1% of the world thought I was terrible, and now I feel like it's up to like 4 or 5%. So it's still not the majority, but as you know, something negative you feel seven times more than something positive. And when people are angry with you, it's kind of like restaurant reviews or whatever, they're more likely to leave a bad review than a good review.

(00:53:14):
The people who WordPress, 98% of all the core developers have stayed and contribute and are working on the next version and are supportive and all these sorts of things. And part of the reason these folks are so good is they don't spend all their time on Twitter and Reddit arguing with folks, and also the arguments could be... they're very frustrating because people don't engage in good faith. They don't really change their mind when new facts are introduced.

(00:53:43):
And so I've done my best actually because from the open source side I'm really used to engaging with things, and I think that's been one thing I've learned from this is in some forums it doesn't matter how you engage and especially if you have bots or other things running there. I'd leave comments on Reddit and immediately get like 40 downvotes. I'm like, "Hey, this is a article about me and I'm adding a fact to the thing. Why is it getting downvoted? This is very relevant to the discussion." But it's literally hidden. So when you see that thread, you'd have to click like three or four times to see the comment I had left, and so it can really change the perception. And then when you read these things, I think it's just very human nature. Even folks very close to me, if you read a thread and it's all super negative, it's hard to not be influenced by that because we're social creatures.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):
100%.

Matt Mullenweg (00:54:37):
Now the good news is I've had lots of credibility weighted support from people like Marc Benioff or other open source leaders or the core people in WordPress, Matias, Mary Hubbard, all the core committers. The international community actually, like just in Japan, they don't care about this stuff. So these are actually, if you look by number of commits and lines of code and everything like that, the folks who actually are most crucial in WordPress. So I feel like that's been a good balance as well for me because there are days where I'm like, "Gosh, am I an idiot?" or it could be really down reading all these things. So that is part of what allows me to balance and get back to that sort of positive, optimistic space that I think you need to be in to do great software and great work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):
Yeah. The internet can be brutal. Let me go through a couple of specific things that people pointed out because I think you've been on a lot of podcasts and people haven't asked you these questions and I think a lot of people are just like, "But, Matt, what about this? This is really bad." So let me just ask you a couple of things here. One is there's just like a frustration in the community around the instability that this has just caused in the WordPress community. I'll read you a couple quotes. "Real people are receiving fewer projects on WordPress because C-suite are seeing WordPress as unstable because of this feud, and I work at Enterprise and we're very concerned about the stability of this platform and our projects." Just thoughts on that and the impact that it's had on the community.

Matt Mullenweg (00:56:05):
Yeah, I think this is until this gets resolved... which by the way I hope it is soon. I think there's no business reason for this to continue. I really hope that they come to a settlement or something. We're ready. They could end this tomorrow if they wanted to. WP Engine could. We can't. We're just defending right now. So it's really incumbent on them. All of our competitors, by the way, are like, "Great. WordPress, the king on the hill, all of a sudden we can use this." And so there's also not just from WP Engine, but also from all the competitors to WordPress, and all the people who would love to capture some market share, they're really leaning into this. So I've seen white papers, I've seen all sorts of things where people talk about this.

(00:56:49):
We're actually in the next couple of days going to publish something really cool on the WordPress.org blog though that shows if you actually look at the numbers, like the activity, number of commits, plugin updates, downloads, installs of WordPress since September 20th when this all started, it's quite healthy. And so I'm not saying that there isn't examples of where someone lost a project or something like that. I'm sure it's happened. It's the internet's big. WordPress has so many millions of users and developers and everything that you're going to get some example. But by the numbers things are actually quite healthy, and in some ways it's not that there's no press is bad press, it's raised the awareness of WordPress quite a bit. So people who haven't talked about WordPress in years are now like, "Oh, Let's talk about it." And so a little bit of drama I think, I wouldn't do this all the time, but a little bit can be a good thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Okay, so one of the most common frustrations I've seen on the internet, people complaining is around the trademark. I don't know all the details, but my understanding is there's kind of a... you moved the trademark to be owned by the foundation and Automattic is exclusive rights to use the trademark. And I think people are like, "Oh, I thought it was the foundation owned it, but maybe Matt still owns it and then you're trying to monetize it through this agreement with WP Engine." Is there anything you can share there that'll make people feel and see your side of the story?

Matt Mullenweg (00:58:10):
Yeah, this is totally fair because it's complicated, but people are saying this has been private. This has all been very public and documented on the internet from the beginning. So WordPress.org has always been me personally, and I think because it's... part of the reason we started there is . com was not available when we started. So that's why we started on the .org and things like that. But I think people also assume .org means nonprofit or something, and that's sometimes true but it's not always. It's not a requirement of the .org domain. Then when I founded Automattic and when we did register the trademark that actually was registered under Automattic. So it used to be, for the first five years of the project or whatever, that Automattic just owned everything outright. And again, I had investors and the board and that was under the control of that.

(00:59:06):
Now, as Automattic became more successful I was able to consolidate some voting rights and other things and at least later advocate. Also remember, I was like 21 when all this was happening, so I was not maybe the most savvy about legal stuff or didn't always have the best advice. So later as I learned more, I was like, "Oh, I want to actually take this out of the company and create a nonprofit." And so we ended up creating a nonprofit. Now the rules around 501(3)(C) nonprofits run the IRS are actually very strict. So that's also something as people assume, it's like, oh, doesn't the nonprofit run the software, and we applied for that originally and it was denied by the IRS.

(00:59:47):
So we actually weren't able to put WordPress.org or the software itself under the nonprofit, but we were able to have sort of an educational purview. So what was eventually approved was sort of running the meetups and other things for WordPress, doing educational stuff. We sponsor a lot of learn to code or running workshops in other countries. We have this cool thing called do_action where we'll do a weekend where we take a bunch of nonprofits and build websites for them and stuff like that. So the nonprofit does a lot of exciting things there and then also negotiated with the investors and everyone at Automattic to actually put the trademark under the foundation.

(01:00:31):
Now the compromise there was that Automattic at this point is running WordPress.com. So to continue running that, which at the time had already tens of millions of users and everything, it needed a commercial license. And so the compromise is that the foundation would kind of own the trademark and license it out for non-commercial purposes. I had a license to run WordPress.org because obviously I need that. And then Automattic would retain the commercial license and the ability to sub-license that, so to sell that to others. So this was kind of the grand compromise and create this tripartite structure. I was very inspired by the three branches of government. So there's sort of power in each of those that I think sort of checks and balances each side of it which is on purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:23):
Wow. Okay, I get why it's complicated. I get why people would be confused. This makes me think about OpenAI had a really strange structure and that got them in a lot of trouble, and it feels like when you're 21 you're like, "Oh, this makes a lot of sense. What a great concept we've come up here," and then all this complexity just adds to a lot of confusion around what's going on. So thank you for addressing that. Another, there's a kind of related question I've seen a couple of times is just why don't you let that .org be run by a community. Why not just give that up to someone else and not just you that's there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:01:53):
Yeah, and the frame of that question is kind of interesting because it implies I'm the only person making WordPress which is obviously not true. If you look at the daily commits and activity and everything, it is run by the community. So it's hundreds of volunteers every day that are actually doing the day-to-day work and making the daily decisions and everything happens. So there has been a radical delegation. However, there's ultimately a hierarchy, and I'm the CEO, so I'm like the final final decision-maker.

(01:02:24):
And so I think what people advocate for around this governance point of view is like, okay, well, install a board on top of you that ultimately makes decisions for the product or things like that. And there are other open source projects that have this structure. None of them have been successful as WordPress. So I think your audience in particular, is great software ever created by committee or does it more often reflects a vision of a leader or something that can allow us to... and I think particularly WordPress not just remaining relevant but actually accelerating growth over huge technological shifts over the past two decades.

(01:03:12):
When we started there was dynamic web apps or DHTML or JavaScript wasn't really a thing, and then the social web and then iPhones and then all this sort of stuff that's changed over time, and we've surfed a lot of these technological changes which is very, very hard to do. Most products do not remain relevant over multiple generational changes like that, and that's been because sometimes we've had to make very unpopular decisions. Gutenberg is a huge part of why WordPress is relevant today, and it's actually an open source project we do. It's the block editor. It's actually bigger than WordPress because it's not just used on WordPress, it's used on every WordPress site, but also like Tumblr, other people. I would actually love if Squarespace or Wix adopted Gutenberg. It's meant to be like a really open source framework.

(01:03:56):
But anyway, if we had voted for whether we should do that or not, everyone would've voted against it or the majority would have. It was really a few core people of us in the community, Matias, myself, other core contributors, Ella, Andrew Ozz, that said, "Hey, this is the future and it's going to take 10 years to do and it's going to be a long bet. It's going to suck for the first three or four years, and so everyone's going to hate it in the beginning."

(01:04:20):
But then later with iteration, we've had I think now 200 releases of Gutenberg. We do sort of a very strict every two weeks release schedule since it started. It's going to get pretty good, and it's at that point now where it's actually getting pretty darn good. And the next phase of it, actually I'm so excited about, it's going to be collaboration. So all the real time co-editing like Google Docs and Notion has, it's coming out to this open source thing, and with the technological changes, we're actually able to do it peer-to-peer. So we don't need a centralized server. We can use WebRTC and other cool technologies.

(01:04:49):
I mean, anyway, I'm going sidelining, but I think that sort of more... and if you look at a lot of great companies, there's a board or whatever but ultimately there's an executive, and some of the most iconic companies of our generations are ones where the executive retains some majority of voting control or other things like that which I've been able to do with Automattic and with WordPress. And I definitely think about succession planning and everything like that, but if or when I'm gone I don't want to pass it to a committee. I want to pass it to someone else who can have a role similar to mine and really sort of try to be a steward.

(01:05:34):
There ultimately is a check and balance on that because, again, the community could leave. They could fork the software. People could change. And so you're "in charge" quote, unquote, but you're also at surface. So it's a lot more being like a mayor than a CEO and that you ultimately are accountable to the folks who are contributing and new users and everything like that. So I do feel like there is a balance there. Some of this as well is that there's some people who aren't part of leadership who feel like they should be. So if you look at the Yoast or Korean things, these are folks who actually don't have commit status. They haven't contributed WordPress over the years and serve our normal hierarchy of the meritocracy of how you get the ability to commit code or things like that. They're like, "Hey, I want to lead a release." That's cool, dude, but there's a process. We have different people lead releases over the years, but they kind of worked their way up to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):
This makes so much sense to me. That's one of the themes of the podcast, just the power of a singular visionary and leader, founder mode as we've all heard is trending these days.

Matt Mullenweg (01:06:38):
You made famous, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
I wouldn't say that it was. Yeah, Brian shared it, but then Paul Graham pointed afterwards and then I renamed the title of that episode Founder Mode to [inaudible 01:06:49]

Matt Mullenweg (01:06:49):
I really want your [inaudible 01:06:50]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):
If I zoom out, what I'm sensing here is there's people that have this ideal of how something like this should run, but they've never actually worked at a place where a nonprofit board runs it, runs a thing, and have seen what that actually looks like. And so I think there's a big disconnect between the ideal in theory and how does great stuff get built.

Matt Mullenweg (01:07:11):
And one of the things I think we've tried to demonstrate with WordPress is actually it's kind of like a open source side and a nonprofit side and a for-profit working in concert. And one of the things people don't necessarily appreciate as much about why WordPress has been so successful is because of Automattic and things like Akismet doing anti-spam or WordPress.com having a free version of WordPress that is introduced over a hundred million people to the software in a way that you could just sign up for free. You don't have to pay for hosting or download it yourself or things like that.

(01:07:43):
So that kind of for-profit, nonprofit, open source, working in concert I think is a really interesting model that we're starting to see a lot more companies do. It's actually very exciting to me that some of the things that were controversial when we started open source or distributed work are now the default for so many exciting new startups, and this whole ecosystems of really, really cool open source, like Cal.com for open source Calendly. There's so much cool stuff out there that actually there's a whole generation of younger entrepreneurs that I find very, very inspiring because they're also bringing modern design and web development and everything to open source which is very neat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):
I anticipate a blog post one day, "I told you so, guys." Open source, remote work, I imagine there's a few more things there. There's one other thing I want to address. I haven't seen you talk about this. It comes up a bunch. It's around, this is very the weeds, but I think it's really important to people, and there's something here for a lot of people, the way you guys forked Advanced Custom Fields. So I think what happened here is you guys forked an existing plugin, I think somebody else's plugin, and then kind of pushed people to this plugin versus the original plugin. What can you share there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:08:55):
Yeah, this is very complex. So WordPress.org has kind of like a app store. After WP Engine started suing us, creating millions of dollars of legal fees and things, we blocked their access to WordPress.org. So this plugin they had, Advanced Custom Fields, wasn't able to be updated. At the same time a number of security issues were found in it, including some we reported, and so there had to be an update to it. So we're like, "Okay, we'll ship the update for you essentially." And then we were like, "Okay, I think we need to call it something different because it actually isn't theirs anymore." And they still offer Advanced Custom Fields on their own and people can download it from them, et cetera. So we made Secure Custom Fields which was originally under the same directory listing, so again, because we want all the users of it to get the security updates. This is controversial, and actually they actually got a preliminary injunction, so the judge said "Reverse this." So this has all been reversed by the way.

(01:10:04):
There now is a separate fork under separate listing of Secure Custom Fields which actually we have a team on it, developers, designers, and we're creating... just like WordPress was a fork, we've actually forged this. Actually WooCommerce was a forge. A lot of things are forks. So we forked it and now have a new name, new everything that we're doing a lot of product innovation and improving it. So there's a separate project now and separate directory listing for Secure Custom Fields. That's kind of fast-forward to today. They now have access to WordPress.org again. They have updated the plugin. Everything's back to how it was before, and there's now this separate thing called Secure Custom Fields that the WordPress project is officially supporting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):
So I'm hearing essentially you blocked WP Engine as a part of this, we're just going to simplify WordPress, reduce confusion. They're being bad actors in the space, so we're going to block them, and in that block, there's like a dependency where people couldn't do a thing that they needed to do. So you're like, "And the one that exists, there's a problem with it, so we're going to make that dependence... release a version that you can actually use and fix the security issues."

Matt Mullenweg (01:11:09):
That was the intention. I think that there was a lot of perceptions around it that were different, but yeah, that was the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):
Okay. Okay. Great. So maybe just the last question. We talked about just a lot of people see you with devil horns these days. They think you're doing bad things and they don't like the approach you're taking. You talked about there's this WP Engine spending a lot of money on PR and hiring this agency. I guess is there anything else that... why do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy? Is it mostly that you think... just where do you think it's coming from? Why are comments always so negative? And we talked a bit about it, but anything more there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:11:46):
I don't know if I can say why. I do think one thing I've learned is that a lot of these things we've talked about are nuanced. So one essentially thing I've learned in this process is that it's hard to explain this stuff in 240 characters or the-

Matt Mullenweg (01:12:00):
... 40 characters. Some mediums do not lend themselves well to discussing this. And so I tried, but I'm participating less in Reddit or Twitter and trying to do more long form things like this, where you can actually have the context and things can't be taken out of context. Also, I think there's something where social networks sometimes are tuned to promote outrage. And it was very interesting. We ran a sentiment analysis recently. We were kind of looking at different social networks, analyzing all the comments, and we found, actually, that the negative, the sort of devil horn fraction on, what was it, like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram was like 8%. It's actually pretty small. On Reddit, it was bigger, I forget the exact number, but on Twitter it was 52%. You're like, whoa, what's going on there?

(01:12:53):
And so there's something in the algorithm, and again, we can't see how the algorithm works or what the incentives are, but it can promote the most controversial things. I think that's not a novel perception. There's a lot of discussion around how social media might be creating more fragmentation in society, and I think this is just an example of that, where when you have networks, when people are getting the majority of the information from social networks, and those networks are not designed to provide nuance or balance, or even promote truth necessarily, misinformation can get spread far more than... What's the saying? Like a lie gets around the world seven times before truth has time to-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Get out of bed.

Matt Mullenweg (01:13:31):
Get out of bed, yeah. There's been a lot of that. So there's actually been a lot of misinformation, untrue things that go viral, and then the untrue thing gets like 700,000 views, and the correction gets like 20,000 views. So there's been some of that happening. When mainstream media has covered this, it's actually been a lot better. So there's been some actually really good articles in some business publications and other things that sort of look at a more nuanced and balanced view. And I think the podcast have been pretty good, but definitely on Twitter, I think you can get a version of all of this that is both, I think, not entirely true and also pretty more negative.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):
Yeah. I imagine people are going to be like, "Lenny, you didn't ask him this thing. Here's the thing he said that I want to learn more about." I'm sure I missed some stuff, but from an outsider's perspective, this all make sense. There's a company, I don't think PE companies are bad innately, but their job is buy a company and make it run more efficiently, and then oftentimes sell it for more. So it makes sense that they buy a company, make it more efficient, cut some corners, don't put a lot of effort into making it awesome, even though I'm sure there's awesome people working in there, trying really hard to make it great. And basically what I'm feeling is they got to a point where this is hurting the ecosystem. They're feeling really dishonest with working with you, and there's a stalling technique. And so, makes sense to me why you just have to stand up and fight back. And it's hard, it's hard to do that. Is there anything else along this thread before we move on to a different topic, anything else you want to share before we close out this chapter?

Matt Mullenweg (01:15:15):
Well, if people have more questions, they can come to WordCamp Asia. We're going to do an open Q&A there. We do town halls in the WordPress.org Community. There's a Slack people can get on and ask questions. So there is kind of a lot of open ways to engage, and I'm definitely happy to do that. I'm probably not going to do it on Twitter as much, but when there's longer form opportunities to have a discussion here, particularly if it's more like real time, like this, I'm very happy to.

(01:15:43):
And that's why if you look at it, there's actually a big difference. WP Engine has not done any podcasts and no press. They don't respond to journalists, they don't talk about this. And I've done the opposite, where I'm really trying to be out there and engaged. And everyone's like, "Why don't you just let the lawyers do the talking?" And it's like, well, but we have community, and also I feel like we're in the right. So when you're in the wrong, you probably say only have the lawyers talk. When you're in the right, I think you should be out there and telling the story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):
I remember at the end of your WordCamp talk, you were like, "Any questions?" after this big controversial talk, and I'm curious how it felt. All the questions initially were nothing to do with this. It's what it felt like. You're just like, oh, they already had these questions. They didn't even know what you said maybe, and I bet you're just like, wait, did anyone hear what I just said? Did it feel like that?

Matt Mullenweg (01:16:28):
Well, also, that's really like a WordPress community event, so it's a lot of the core developers and things, so they have WordPress questions, so that is something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
You're like, hello.

Matt Mullenweg (01:16:38):
I've now done hundreds and hundreds of these town halls and QAs, and I really enjoy it because you never know what's going to come up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:42):
Yeah, okay. I want to talk about all the companies that you bought and will buy in the future. It's kind of like you're building a little Berkshire Hathaway. I think you've described it that way. It's kind of what it's feeling like. And Tumblr is really interesting. Until I started prepping for this, I didn't even know you guys own Tumblr. I haven't heard this story. Why did you guys buy Tumblr? What is going on with Tumblr? It was like a big deal back in the day. What is the current state of Tumblr? What is the story there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:17:10):
Oh, Tumblr is so interesting. At the time, I think it was one of our best competitors. They created this really amazing sort of hybrid of blogging and social networking. And if you kind of zoom back, a lot of things that are now standard on other social networks, even the ability to embed an image with a post, again, it was not supported originally on Twitter and other things. Remember they used to have, what was it, like tweet image, or you have to linked out to other things to post an image to Twitter. It wasn't native functionality, and Tumblr had these multiple post types. You could post a chat, an image. They were, I think, one of the first to support video, so they did a lot of, I think, product innovation under the leadership of David Karp, who's a really amazing entrepreneur and product leader.

(01:17:54):
Funny story, both David and I were at CNET at the same time. They had hired both of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
What an alumni group at CNET.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:02):
They could have kept both of us probably. But anyway, the Tumblr, I forget the year, but they sold, I think the same time that Instagram did, for a similar amount, $1.1 billion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):
To you or to someone else?

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:16):
Instagram bought by Facebook, obviously.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
Right, right. Tumblr.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:20):
And Tumblr bought by Yahoo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):
Oh, wow.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:22):
Who was at the time, again, Yahoo, we don't think about it now, but I feel a little old. But at the time, Yahoo was one of the internet giants and had recently Marissa Mayer, who was one of the big early people at Google, I think part of creating the API program and everything like that, was the CEO of Yahoo. This was, I think, one of her first big acquisitions.

(01:18:46):
Now subsequently, obviously ,we know how Instagram went. I think people were like, "I can't believe you bought this for a billion dollars." And obviously now it's worth hundreds of billions. So that's had a really good trajectory. At Yahoo, I think things became more challenged. So again, this is a little bit of history, but Yahoo then had this thing where they owned part of Alibaba, which then became more valuable than the rest of the company. They had activist investors. I think they had some CEO switches. I think Marissa Mayer leaves or gets fired at some point. There's all this turnover, and I think Tumblr really languished under their ownership. And from what I can understand, the team was actually held back a lot from things they wanted to launch or ways they wanted to iterate. Then Yahoo merges with AOL, which is another kind of early internet thing. That goes for a little while. So again, then Tumblr's just kind of stuck underneath this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:43):
Tumbling along.

Matt Mullenweg (01:19:45):
Tumbling along. And then that gets bought by Verizon. So fast-forward to 2019. Verizon wants to get rid of Tumblr. And so they're kind of putting it up for sale and had a number of bidders. Automattic ended up buying it for a de minimis amount. I think it's been reported we bought it for $3 million.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:10):
What a deal. 3 million.

Matt Mullenweg (01:20:14):
But obviously, that represented a lot of value destruction over the years. Tumblr had had some tough times. They actually were banned from the App Store at one point for not moderating things well enough and having maybe a little too much porn. Obviously, Twitter [inaudible 01:20:31] porn. They maybe were a little too out there with it, and we're doing a good job filtering it and keeping away from App Store reviewers or whatever. And so Verizon, to their credit though, there were people bidding more. Actually I think a porn company was bidding on Tumblr that would've paid a lot more money. They really were looking for an acquirer that they felt like would be a good steward. From my point of view, I had such incredible respect for Tumblr as a product. And the community, still, despite all of this sort of stuff that had happened, I think at that point still was like, I forget the exact number, but call it 15, 20 million monthly active users.

(01:21:14):
So really, sort of active core. And one of the things that's so fascinating is over half of that user base was under the age of 25. And actually had a huge, I think, it was like 25 or 30% LGBT+. I think a very unique place on the internet, where people could have a social network where they could be anonymous, they could put on different identities, they could be someplace their parents weren't, like Facebook or Instagram, really still could take a special spot. So we ended up buying it. Now, people are like, "Oh, you bought it for $3 million." But we bought it sort of taking on all liabilities, including, I think they were under investigation by the FTC, there were lawsuits. There was all this sort of stuff. So it was free like a puppy, not free like-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Free like beer.

Matt Mullenweg (01:22:05):
Had a pretty big team, I think 185 people. We were taking a lot of burners, burning a ton of cash, and that was 2019. And so, it's been, I think, a humbling experience running a social network. It was very, very different from all the other products that we've done. And I think there's some incredible things about Tumblr and that I'm still very excited about. So where WordPress has primarily a desktop and web user base, Tumblr is obviously like 85% app-based, has a younger demographic. And so part of the vision that now we're executing on is actually we wanted to create a path for people using Tumblr to actually it being powered by WordPress on the back end. So Tumblr users could unlock themes, customization, plugins, et cetera. Actually, we're in the process right now of migrating the half a billion Tumblr sites to WordPress, probably one of the largest data migrations-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:58):
That makes sense.

Matt Mullenweg (01:23:00):
... that's happened in a while. So we're kind of trying to do this in a way that's invisible to users on the front end, so changing at the back end while maintaining the APIs and the interface and everything. So it's a fun engineering project. I kind of posted this kind of call to arms, got a lot of fun people applying for Automattic, and we hired a lot of great folks around this sort of audacious project, this big hairy audacious goal. And so that's where it's at now. I've sort of ran it personally for a few years while we're doing turnarounds, but there's a great team there, but still challenged, still not profitable, so we're still subsidizing it from the rest of Automattic's businesses. Fortunately, the rest of our business have done really well, so we were able to do that, but I definitely want to get to a place where it's sustainable.

(01:23:46):
And one of the things we're also experimenting with is can Tumblr have not just an advertising-driven model? I think ultimately the incentives of advertising social networks can lead to the kind of dynamics that you see on the more negative side of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, et cetera. And so really trying to create a subscription model or a sort of first-party user-driven advertising, where you promote your blog posts or something like that, or you promote a WooCommerce product or something, where it's not a third-party ad ecosystem, which I think has a lot of weird code and malware and lots of stuff I don't love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
Wow, sounds like a lot you took on with this acquisition, and I love that you said you ran it initially. So this is a good segue to maybe my last question. I'm curious where this goes. Just how do you... Well, let me zoom out. There's a lot of people these days that are excited about roll of businesses. I'm going to buy a bunch of companies, make them better, make them awesome, save money, and then just keep building this holding company sort of thing. You guys are doing that, and it's working well. What do you look for? How do you decide a company's right for Automattic? What are the factors that are like, we should buy this, we can turn this around and turn it into a big success?

Matt Mullenweg (01:24:58):
I don't know if I would do another turnaround like Tumblr again, or at least not for many, many years. It's definitely a different thing. The vast majority of things we acquire, it's simply something that's done well, and we want to accelerate it, or sometimes acqui-hires, where we're plugging it into one of our existing projects, or we're taking the team and putting them on something we're already doing. So it's a really talented team. Tumblr, I think we ended up ultimately replacing 85, 90% of the team as well. So that's just very different. So I do think there are different ways of doing it, but if you look at our other acquisitions like Day One, et cetera, founder's still here, many years later, we're accelerating stuff like that. We brought it to Android, we're bringing it to it to web. It's more of taking something good and making it better. And probably our best example there is WooCommerce, which was a small company, I think 35, 40 people, based out of South Africa, and has obviously grown to... Again, I said Automattic makes about half a billion dollars a year now, and WooCommerce is a majority of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):
Speaking of that, actually, you haven't shared the revenue number. I know it's public. Just give people a sense of Automattic's revenue. Can you just share those numbers? Because I think it might blow people's minds.

Matt Mullenweg (01:26:15):
Yeah, I think we say publicly it's about a half a billion dollars in sort of ARR revenue right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:20):
Incredible. Okay. I have a question for you. It's kind of a hot seat question. As you talked, I wonder, I feel like people are thinking of this. So you've been talking about PE companies being often bad. You're buying Tumblr. You've talked about laying off a bunch of people, turning it all around. How's that different from a PE company, Matt?

Matt Mullenweg (01:26:39):
Yeah, and I agree with you that just because it's private equity doesn't mean it's bad. And also, something people say is like, "Hey, wait, don't you have private equity investors as well at Automattic?" And we do. Now, they own usually a small percentage, sometimes under 1%, and they don't have control of the company. So I think there's a distinguish. Is it a minority investment or a control investment? And with WP Engine, Silver Lake controls the company. And when they control the company, I think there's a spectrum of actions. Obviously, being more efficient is great, and we should all strive for that. And I think every business does, whether it's private equity or our business or things that are founder controlled. You always want to be more efficient. Now, there's some spectrum there where you over-optimize, or you could have dark patterns. Right now on WP Engine, it's very difficult to cancel your accounts. Actually, I think as of today, 45,000 sites have left, so they're, I think, down to 600. Yeah, well, because their customers have realized like, "Hey, this isn't WordPress, this isn't..." or, "They're suing the guy who started WordPress, so maybe we should not support this commercially." So we have the site wordpressenginetracker.com that sort of shows in real time the sites that are leaving. It's kind of an exciting thing to see that number tick up. Actually, maybe a good example as well, even though there's a lot of negativity, you actually look at how people are voting with their wallets. They're leaving.

(01:28:07):
So I think you have to judge as well, just look at the track record. So one of the things I'm very proud of with Automattic is we are an acquirer of first resort, and we have founders that have sold to us. Paul Mayne at Day One is a great example that didn't need to sell. They're wildly profitable, could have run it himself for a long, long time, but people choose to join because they feel like we'll be good stewards of it in the future, and ultimately just have to look at the track record.

(01:28:36):
So I think don't judge it by what it's called, judge it by the actions over time. And I hope to continue building that reputation for a place that's a good steward of communities and software and everything else for many years to come.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:52):
Matt, we covered so much. I asked you all the hard questions and more. Before we wrap up, is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with? Any last thoughts, comments, insights, stories?

Matt Mullenweg (01:29:04):
Yeah, follow me. I'm at photomatt, P-H-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, on Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, everything like that. I post a lot about other stuff. I post a lot about AI and open source and other things. Some WordPress things in there as well. I have these life missions to democratize publishing and commerce. We added a new one last year, which is messaging, so it's in beta mode right now, but relaunching in a few months as a product called Beeper, which takes all your Telegram, Instagram DMs, Signal, everything, brings it all into one app. And you can do some really cool stuff like that, and especially when you start to imagine search or AI, local AI around that. So very, very excited about that relaunch. So I encourage people to, you check out the beta now, go to beeper.com/beta to get the new version, and we're going to relaunch that later in the year.

(01:29:50):
So yeah, I'm very excited about that. It's kind of fun to be working on something that's at the stage where WordPress was in 2003, 2004. So WordPress is quite mature at this point. WooCommerce is kind of where WordPress was in 2010. And then the Beeper stuff, the messaging stuff is where we were in 2003. So one thing that keeps me excited is working at different stages of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):
This feels like a reason to be doing your approach to Berkshire Hathaway is just stay active in early stage stuff and not just optimize established things. So it's beeper.com, by the way, awesome domain name. Photomatt, what's the story of photomatt? You're into photography, I imagine, is the story?

Matt Mullenweg (01:30:32):
Yeah, it's a little bit of a pun. So a fotomatt is also, F-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, is a place that you would go to develop your photos back when you would have film and develop things. So originally my username was Saxmatt because I played the saxophone. Sometimes people mishear that. And also, I started traveling so much. There's been years I do like 400,000 miles of air travel, because I go around the world to go to WordPress events and meet the community. And as a distributed company, we do lots of meetups. And so, it became hard to carry my saxophone around. So my method of artistic expression became photography, and that's actually kind of how WordPress started, was actually originally a site where I could share my photos before Flickr, before Facebook and everything like that, sort of use this gallery software, actually open source gallery software, PHP software, to sort of share all the photos I was taking.

(01:31:25):
And actually now on my website, I think I have over 38,000 photos I posted. And yeah, it's still one of the things I really love. So it's also a username that was available everywhere, and I still do it. So I'm actually going to the Maha Kumbh Mela, the big 300-million-person gathering at the Ganges River in a few weeks. And one, I'm just excited to experience that, it happens every 12 years, but two, I'm just really excited to take some time to do photography. And yeah, I really enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:56):
You forgot to mention your website and your blog, your WordPress site itself, where you blog. Ma.tt, is the domain, which is amazing. I will point people to one of my favorite ritual you have on your blog, which is you share what's in your bag, you talk about how you travel all this, and I think every year you're like, here's the gadgets I use most and bring with me everywhere.

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:18):
It's my most popular post of the year by far.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:20):
I'm not surprised. You need an Amazon, just buy everything button. Yeah, because basically you're just trying to optimize for the least weight and most utility, right, out of all these gadgets that you're bringing with the on trips.

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:33):
Yeah, actually weighing it is something I just started doing this year because my bag actually got really heavy, got like 35 pounds or something. And so, some friends were like, "Hey, why don't we weigh everything and just go through." So now I'm posting the weights.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:45):
Oh my god. Okay. Anyway, we'll point people to that. Matt, thank you so much for doing this. This was awesome,

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:50):
Lenny, thank you so much. And I really appreciate the ability to discuss these things in a longer form. And also just your audience. Oh, I guess final thing I'll say is we're hiring a ton. So you have one of the most incredible audiences in the world. I recommend your podcast and newsletter to a lot of my colleagues. And so, if you're someone who loves this kind of stuff, I think there's a big opportunity at Automattic to have an impact on these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:11):
What roles are you hiring for most and where do people find these roles?

Matt Mullenweg (01:33:15):
Automattic.com, A-U-T-O-M-A-T-T-I-C. There's a Work with Us page. You can kind of see how we work. We're fully distributed and can manage that forever. We sort of started that. Another interesting thing is we actually pay the same salaries globally. So whether you're in California or Italy or Nigeria or wherever, we pay global salaries. So yeah, a lot of opportunities, and we're hiring for kind of everything, I would say, but particularly people with great design or product skills is probably one of the areas that you can have the biggest impact at Automattic right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:53):
All right. If you made it this far into the podcast, you should definitely apply. Matt, thank you. Thank you for being here. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

# Building Anchor, selling to Spotify, and lessons learned | Maya Prohovnik (Head of Podcast Product)

## Transcript

Maya Prohovnik (00:00:00):
We were obsessed with reducing friction, this was our constant battle. And so we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this. I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts, and I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Maya Prohovnik. Maya is Spotify's head of product for podcasting where she oversees product design and engineering teams responsible for building the tools and experiences for podcasters and their listeners. Maya was also employee number one at Anchor, which Spotify acquired five years ago, which became the core of Spotify's podcasting hosting platform, which now powers over 75% of all new podcasts created in the world. In our conversation, we dig into why Maya is obsessed with dogfooding and why she encourages everyone on her team to create their own podcast. She's got four podcasts of her own, which are all very highly rated and people love. We dig into how she stays productive and organized in a very hectic senior leadership role, what she's done to allow for Anchor to continue to operate like a startup within a larger organization.

Lenny (00:01:44):
Also, a bunch of really fun early Anchor stories, including how interns uploaded podcasts to Apple and Spotify manually before they could automate that. Plus, how to find a balance between using your gut and using data to make decisions. Also, public speaking tips, so much more. Maya is amazing and I'm really excited for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Maya Prohovnik after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.

Lenny (00:02:33):
This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today, jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more.

Maya Prohovnik (00:04:38):
Thank you so much for having me. You and I have been trying to get together for almost a year now.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Oh, man. But it all worked out and it's going to be very worth it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:04:45):
You had a kid. I took parental leave.

Lenny (00:04:47):
Oh, right. That is true. Man, overlapping kid journeys. I also have been just really looking forward to this chat partly because you're amazing and partly because it just feels very meta to have the head of product of Spotify podcasting on the podcast, and I imagine many people are listening to this on Spotify, so there's this, I don't know, turtles all the way down situation happening.

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:08):
I totally agree. I was thinking the same thing when I was preparing for it where it's like so much of what we have to talk about is so meta, and then we also have you and I know each other because you've been sending me feedback about the podcast experience on Spotify, so lots of circular stuff there.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Speaking of Spotify and podcasting, clearly you've done an incredible job building podcasting on Spotify. From what I've read, it's the number one podcasting platform now. Is there a stat you could share by just the percentage of the market share essentially of Spotify podcasting?

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:37):
I think we are now officially over a third of global market share of podcast listening, which is pretty insane.

Lenny (00:05:43):
That is insane.

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:44):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:44):
Also, I think on the hosting side, it's an even bigger number. Is there a stat you can share by just maybe new podcasts that are launched and how many are hosted on Spotify?

Maya Prohovnik (00:05:53):
Yeah, I think at this point it's more than 75% of all new shows on Spotify are hosted with Spotify for podcasters, which used to be Anchor. When we were acquired by Spotify, I think Anchor had already gotten to 40% of all new podcasts or something crazy. So, yeah.

Lenny (00:06:09):
Insane. Okay, so for these reasons, I want to spend the time that we have together unpacking how you operate as a product leader and essentially what you've learned about product org leadership growth and all those things. How's that sound?

Maya Prohovnik (00:06:22):
That sounds perfect. My favorite topics.

Lenny (00:06:24):
Okay, let's do it. So as the first question I asked a PM who actually works for you, Wilma Chu, what to ask you, and the first thing that came to mind for her was this idea of dogfooding and how important dogfooding is to your way of operating as a product leader. As an example, you have three of your own podcasts on Spotify and I checked them out and they're all very highly rated, so they're not just like bullshit podcasts, they're real people actually listen and enjoy them. So my question to you is just why is dogfooding so important to you? How do you actually operationalize it? And then also maybe just talk about these podcasts that you have.

Maya Prohovnik (00:06:58):
Sure. Well, I can talk about them forever, so be careful because I'll take up the whole hour with that. But I actually have four podcasts. There's two that I don't update as much anymore. So my first ever podcast was about Stephen King books. I'm a big Stephen King super fan. So, when I joined Anchor, and we weren't even fully podcasts yet, if you recall, we were something else audio, we were trying to avoid being podcasts for a while and then we decided to just be podcasts. But when I got into audio and trying to help audio creators, the first thing I did was make my own podcast because I was like, I know nothing about production or what it feels to even be a creator in that way.

Maya Prohovnik (00:07:35):
And so I started my Stephen King podcast because that is the number one thing that I just love to talk about every day, which is one of my tips for podcasters. If you're trying to figure out what to make a show about, it's what can you talk about for? So I did that one for a while actually. I spent a ton of time editing it. I spent a ton of time on SEO and marketing it, and it got to the point, I think at its peak I was getting 5,000 listeners in a episode, which now seems small for a podcast, I know.

Lenny (00:07:59):
No, that's very legit.

Maya Prohovnik (00:08:01):
Yeah, for a test podcast that I was just doing to learn how to do my job, I was so excited to get that audience and I fell off because, well, mostly I had a kid, I joined Spotify. My life's really busy and that level of production is so hard to do if it's not your full-time job, but I still get emails all the time from people who are like, please bring it back. I never found another great Stephen King because I really got deep into the books and the connection between the books. So that was one of them. The second one I did, still going today. So my husband and I have this Big Brother podcast, the show Big Brother, it's terrible.

Maya Prohovnik (00:08:33):
I would not recommend listening to my podcast unless you are a Big Brother super fan, and I actually started that one because I wanted to get the other end of the spectrum where something we were really focused on with Anchor at the time was first time creators really growing the pie of podcasters and specifically we had this theory that podcast creation of the future would be mobile first and we had this really high-powered mobile app, and so I was like, I'm going to make a podcast that's fully mobile, not highly edited, not worry about making something that sounds like a traditional podcast. And I really leaned into all the Anchor features. So it's fully recorded on my phone. I do almost no editing, but I think the thing that's kept us going, because it's been six or seven years now we've been doing the show, it's really the community, the people who call in.

Maya Prohovnik (00:09:15):
I have no idea who these people are. I have no idea how they found this terrible show, but they love it. They call in every week. And that I think is one of the many things I've learned from dogfooding, a podcast creation app is that community piece is so important. If you don't know if anyone's listening, if you don't know what they like about it, if you don't know if they're coming back, it's so hard to keep investing the time. And then I made a show, my least known podcast, because it only got like 25 listeners for episode, it's about my favorite book of all time called Children of Time. It's actually a trilogy. And the reason it got almost no listeners is because there were tons of spoilers in the podcast and the book is like 800 pages long. So we were like, do not listen if you haven't read the book.

Maya Prohovnik (00:09:53):
So, it was very niche, but I think it's a really good podcast if you've read Children of Time. And then my last one I just started doing a couple of years ago is about parenting. So I have a son who's two and a half now and we have been documenting our journey as parents all the way from, we went through IVF, so starting with sort of fertility, I have a really fun episode about childbirth if people are interested in that sort of thing. And then ever since then it's just been episodes about the transition to parenthood, which has not been particularly easy for us, and now my son's a toddler, so lots of fun things happening there. You're not there yet, but you will be and then you can listen to my toddler episodes.

Lenny (00:10:27):
Yeah. I got to listen to the next... A few months ahead to learn from what you've learned.

Maya Prohovnik (00:10:31):
Yes, I think that's a good tactic.

Lenny (00:10:33):
Before we talk about dogfooding, have you ever considered going full-time on this stuff? This is always an option for people and clearly you've done great. At least two podcasts are killing it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:10:44):
I have not. And I think it's so funny because with my parenting podcast too, and even my terrible Big Brother podcast, I get compliments all the time and people are like, "I love listening to this." And my husband also is a really funny and a really good podcaster, but I don't know why I don't think of myself as a creator. I think to me it still feels like this exercise where it's like I'm making my podcast, but I'm really doing it so that I can learn about our product and get in the mindset of a creator. So I think the problem is I'm just too much of a product person. It's a means to an end for me instead of the end itself. But that is an interesting question because I know most people who podcasts, their ultimate goal is obviously to be able to do it full-time and that is interesting that I haven't thought about it.

Lenny (00:11:31):
You have a good backup plan of things if anything goes off the rails.

Maya Prohovnik (00:11:34):
I guess so, yeah.

Lenny (00:11:35):
Awesome. Okay. Just coming back to this idea of dogfooding, where does that come from for you? What have you learned about just how to execute that?

Maya Prohovnik (00:11:40):
It's just always been my natural state. I've had a handful of different product jobs and I guess they've all been tangentially related to helping creators or creative people. And so I think for me it's like I don't know how you can build those tools if you don't understand that mindset. I'm not surprised that it came to Wilma's mind when you asked her what to ask me because I am constantly yelling at my product team who do not have podcasts and being like, I really don't think that you can build the right things. If they talk to users all the time, they see the data, but all of them, once they finally start doing their podcast, they're like, I get it. Something clicked and now I feel like I really understand what they need. And I guess building tools for creators is similar to building a B2B product where you really have to understand business, it's their livelihood.

Maya Prohovnik (00:12:25):
And so I think if you're just looking at a list of feature requests, you're not necessarily going to prioritize it in the same way as if you deeply feel those problems. And I think for me, I don't know if I mentioned this to you, but when I first got into tech, I started in customer support, that was how I got into product, and so I think I just am a very user focused product person. I think there's different schools of thought for product and for me it's always been about making people happy, making their experience better, solving real problems in their lives. And so for me, becoming one of the users, I think it's made it so much easier for me to advocate for that being a pretty big chunk of the roadmap.

Maya Prohovnik (00:13:04):
I think if you don't have that, especially coming from someone in leadership, it's so easy to just fall into that trap of like, well, we're working on the next big strategic thing, which is two years away, and then in the meantime your users are getting no value and then they're just going somewhere else. So I don't know. I think it's really important to me. It makes sense to me and also, I'm not sure how else I would do product. I've never really not done it that way. It

Lenny (00:13:25):
Reminds me of Airbnb Brian was a huge advocate on the host side of the product is like, you need to be a host, but many people couldn't because they didn't have a place that could be hosted. Is there anything you've learned about just how to make this a thing that actually works effectively, a way to operationalize this for people listening, they're like, "Oh, I should start encouraging my team to do?"

Maya Prohovnik (00:13:42):
I'm constantly reminding our team to do this. And then I think that also comes from the other people who are doing it. So we really elevate the people on our team who have their own podcasts, we help them tell their stories internally. Whenever we do an offsite or any team activity, we'll always incorporate podcast creation or some way of making sure everyone on the team is using the tools. I don't know, I think a lot of it just comes from, I'm so vocal about this stuff. The other night I was recording a podcast and I DMed one of the engineers on our team and told him about this tiny little iOS bug and he was like, why are you DMing me about this at nine o'clock at night? I think I was also supposed to be on vacation, I can't remember.

Maya Prohovnik (00:14:20):
But then he got the bug fix the next day. And so I do think making that something that's really top of mind for the team that we do need to fix problems, that these things matter, I don't know. I always listen to the podcast that my team makes, so it's like I know they're going to get at least one listener. And then I think also I try, I think because I understand a big part of building tools for podcasters is understanding all the barriers to entry. It's actually a really difficult thing trying to get someone to put their voice out there, share their story, it's a really emotional journey. And so I feel like I've tried to turn some of the things that I've learned about podcasting into, I've never written it down, maybe I should, but I have a playbook that I'll tell people when they're considering making their own podcast.

Maya Prohovnik (00:15:02):
So it's just things like don't try and record by yourself, find a friend. That's a much easier way to get into it or don't follow a script because then you're going to feel really awkward and uncomfortable and not feel good about it afterwards. Or don't just record a test thing for 30 seconds and publish it because you have to make yourself feel the pain that we're trying to understand in our users.

Lenny (00:15:24):
What's cool about that that could turn into just onboarding education, basically your experience of making a podcast informs how to help new podcasters become successful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:15:31):
Totally, yeah. And also this is less about dogfooding, but one of my favorite things is I'm always just trying to convince everyone I meet to start a podcast, that's just become my annoying thing. And so if I'm interviewing someone for a job or if I'm at a party and mingling with people, it's like somehow the conversation always turns to their passions and then I'm like, you should make a podcast about it. And then they're like, well, I can't. And then I work my way through all the reasons they say they can't do it, and then they go start a podcast. So I'm like one person at a time.

Lenny (00:16:00):
I see how you're growing the platform now.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:02):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:04):
Very unscalable, hands to hand combat at parties. I get it. Okay. One thing you mentioned about being maybe the only listen of your coworkers podcast reminds me there's this platform where you could find Spotify music that has never ever been played once and you could be their first play and just go through.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:22):
That is so cool.

Lenny (00:16:24):
It's very touching, right?

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:25):
Yes. I haven't seen that and now I'm like, how can we productize that for podcasters? That's such a cool thing.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Anyway, another area that I've heard you're really strong at and came up with Wilma and a few other people I talked to is you find a really good balance between being very data-driven and also very gut driven, and this is something a lot of product leaders try to get better at. And so I'm curious just what have you learned about try to find that balance and also is there an example of something where you went against the data and went with your gut and it worked out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:16:58):
If you remember the old days of the internet, I feel like there was really this different way of thinking about product development where it was so much more about what felt good and what made you feel something as a user in that product. And so it's like we used to be a lot more playful I think with software. I think we used to put a lot more emphasis on things like delightful animations or fun little Easter eggs, and I am not sure when or where that got lost, but it feels like product management as a role has gotten formalized and become a little bit more scientific, I'm generalizing, but I think a lot of product managers can be so focused on using the right frameworks and making sure that they have the right roadmap and all of this stuff.

Maya Prohovnik (00:17:37):
And then it's like you find yourself in this cycle where you're just building things to build them and not really thinking about the connection to the end user. I think data is amazing and I'm like, we have such an incredible insights team at Spotify, both my insights team and then the broader one. I think we are so lucky and we have so much knowledge about our users and different cohorts and what people need and what they're missing, and so I think that's extremely valuable. I think where people get into trouble is when they think that they can rely solely on the data. And so what I spend a lot of time talking to my team about is how we can balance that. So thinking about, I guess a couple general things I would say are there are right and wrong times I think for both for your gut and for data. And then there are lots of different kinds of data and different ways to use that data.

Maya Prohovnik (00:18:21):
So I think when you're in the trap of just being like, well, this is the process we always have with insights and we're just going to run this every time we have a feature, I don't think you're going to have a great time. I think if you think of it as part of the creative process as a PM where you're like, I have a hypothesis, I have some data that is helping me understand that hypothesis in the first place or form it in the first place, then I'm going to do some user research and try a couple of things and see what works for people. Then I'm going to make sure that we have success metrics and that we know what we're looking for when we launch, then we're going to follow, et cetera. So I think there's different times and places for all the different types of data collection that you can do.

Maya Prohovnik (00:18:58):
The other thing I would say is something that I have had to learn as a leader, especially as part of a larger organization, when we were a startup Anchor was like 20 people when we got acquired by Spotify. And by the way, Spotify is my first big tech company, so I've always been at startups, so I've learned a lot about that. But when I was leading product at a startup, it's like we're a small team, we're really focused on moving quickly. There isn't a whole lot of stopping to ask what data is supporting this or it's just like we talked to some users and we're like, great, that's a problem. We're just going to go and fix it. And I think at Spotify there's obviously at places like Spotify, I mean, large organizations, there's obviously a lot more people that you need to coordinate.

Maya Prohovnik (00:19:38):
There's a lot of people you have to influence that aren't on your immediate team. And so I think something that I've had to learn is that being gut driven isn't the same as just saying to people, I told you or I believe this, so you have to do it. There really is an art I think to balancing that. And I think that what I try to do is always still as objectively as possible explain why my gut is feeling that way. So it's like you can refer back to your years of experience or other things that you've done that have been similar. You can talk about your experience as a user testing this stuff. You can bring in stories and anecdotes from users to help back it up. And so I have found that that works obviously a lot better.

Maya Prohovnik (00:20:18):
And I think that in the times that either I have done this or I've seen other leaders do it, where they're just like, well, we're just going to do it this way even if you guys don't agree or if the data says something different, those projects are always immediately doomed from the beginning. They're never going to work. You can't drag all these people through something that they don't believe in. So I think I would think of your gut actually as a type of data and I think it's a totally valid one and it's just I think you need to be clear that that's what you're working with, but then it should be taken as seriously as any other data point. So I try and think of it that way where it's like this should all ideally work together. And obviously the more data you have and the more types of data you have, the more convincing you're going to be and the more right you're going to be.

Maya Prohovnik (00:20:56):
So I think it all helps. There were so many of these in the early days of Anchor because I don't even know, I don't think we had a data scientist until we were part of Spotify, so I think it was just engineers running queries. But there were a couple times where we had to move Anchor from 1.0 to 2.0 and then from 2.0 to 3.0, we did these big, I don't like to call them pivots, but sort of evolutions let's say, of our product or our strategy terminology also very important when you're trying to convince people of things. So when I was thinking about those big transitions for us as a team, I think both times we had these big moments with our teams where we had to get everyone on board with making these big changes. So with Anchor 1.0, I don't know if you remember, but it was actually similar to what Clubhouse I think just rebranded to more voice messaging and short form and more about connections between people.

Maya Prohovnik (00:21:50):
And that was the first thing we ever launched and people loved it. People were very excited about it, the data was all good. We had extremely retained users. We anecdotally, we were hearing all this stuff from users all the time that they were staying up all night to use the app, people were meeting each other and falling in love and getting married on our platform, all of these really kind of magical things and we were seeing the user base was growing consistently. But I think we had this feeling, and when I say, I mean, mostly Mike and I at the time, Mike was our CEO, that it just wasn't ever going to be big enough. And so we had this really interesting moment where the users were all telling us, there's no problem. We love this product. They were using it every day, they were coming back. It was slowly growing and we were just like, this just isn't going to get us to where we need to be, our original goal had been we wanted to democratize audio.

Maya Prohovnik (00:22:42):
We wanted to make it something where anyone could easily tell their story, and we were like, if we keep digging ourselves into this niche that a small number of people really, really love, that's great, but that's not really the mission that we sent out set out to solve. And so the 1.0 to 2.0 transition was I think actually pretty painful because for all of those people who had been invested in 1.0, 2.0 didn't work for them. 2.0 was much more about content creation and making more of a radio station, and it was less about telling your personal story and close relationships and more about projecting and using different tools. Anyway, so we made that call I think pretty much just on gut and it was like, this is a business decision. This is where we think the next phase needs to be.

Maya Prohovnik (00:23:25):
When we built Anchor 2.0, it was a lot more like the tools that we wanted to use, even though it wasn't what the user base was asking for. So I think that's one example of sometimes it's that whole users don't always know what to ask for, they don't always know what problems they need you to solve for them. And so I think you really have to be able to hear what's behind it or really even if the data is looking okay, think about if it's heading to where you need it to go.

Lenny (00:23:51):
Before you move on, that's actually such an interesting story because it's so hard to have a product that's working that people love and decide to change it completely. Many founders are probably stuck in this where they're just like, hey, this is working and we're feeling some fit. Is there anything else you learned from that? Because that's a really interesting insight and it worked out in your case clearly.

Maya Prohovnik (00:24:15):
It absolutely worked out. I mean, I think it was a terrifying transition. Us at the time, it took us a few months to build a whole new app, it takes longer now, but the whole time we were building it, we were like, we weren't sure if it was a mistake and we would go back and forth and we would feel guilty when we were talking to our users about what they wanted us to be working on. But I think it was one of those things where as soon as we launched 2.0, our numbers started shooting up and we started seeing more kinds of people were using it and people were suddenly using it in the way that we had always imagined as a replacement for the old school, very difficult to make traditional podcasts.

Maya Prohovnik (00:24:50):
I don't know. I guess the lesson is you have to be able to tell the signal through the noise, and even if you've got lots of vocal users asking for something, we used to have this rule, the 80/20 rule, where it's like you can't just build for that 20, I don't think we made this up by the way. I think this is a common thing, but we'd always refer to it and say, we want to be building for the 80%, and even though the 20% are going to be more vocal, that's just going to get you deeper into that hole of that problem of you're not really building for everyone. And I think particularly when you're trying to build a creative platform, you're trying to democratize something and your target user is everyone on the planet. I think you really have to be willing to kill your darlings and let things go when they're not getting where you need them to be.

Lenny (00:25:35):
That's probably the most common cases. Something is working, but it's not working incredibly well. What do we do? And so that's really interesting. I feel like the first thing you said there is really important of just we had a much bigger mission and vision, and even though this is working, this is never going to get there. There's no path to building a massive business.

Maya Prohovnik (00:25:52):
I do think that's so important, and I give a lot of credit to Mike and our co-founders. I think they really knew what they wanted to do when they started the company and they were very firm on that and never varied that throughout the years throughout the acquisition. And so I do think not everyone's goal is to build a massive multi-billion dollar world changing business, that's okay if that's not your goal, but if that is your goal, you have to stick to it and it's really hard, but you have to keep pivoting to get to where you want to be.

Lenny (00:26:21):
Kill your darlings. I love that phrase, I use it all the time. I think you had a second example. I have a couple other questions of Anchor, but did you want to share another example?

Maya Prohovnik (00:26:28):
Sure, I can just quickly, my second example was, so we actually had to do it again. So we went from Anchor 1.0 to 2.0, we were like, that was totally the right call. And then Anchor 2.0, we were still in this phase where we would always joke about it because people would be like, "Oh, it's kind of like making a podcast." And we would be like, it's not a podcast because we're trying to be bigger than podcasts. Because we were at the time, 2015, there were still so few people podcasting, it was still so hard to do. And so we originally were really stuck on this idea that podcasting was going to be limiting and that we wanted to be the next thing. In the early days of Anchor, we had all this nautical terminology, so we would call them waves and I don't remember what else, but we had cute nautical terms for everything we were trying to resist podcast and podcaster and those things.

Maya Prohovnik (00:27:11):
And when we launched Anchor 2.0, we started getting all of this really great traction and the number one feature requests that we got from people is they were like, great, I love using these tools and then I want to export it as a podcast and publish it and get people listening that way. And we resisted it for probably, I don't know, six months or something and we were like, absolutely not, that's not what we're doing. And I think that one was such an interesting lesson because we had just learned that we did the right thing by not listening to our users. So for a while we dug in and we were like, that's not the direction we're going in, they don't know what they actually want. And then when we decided, I think we started with like, oh, we'll do a little test and let people export us podcasts and see what happens.

Maya Prohovnik (00:27:48):
And when we look back at our data, that's the moment when we saw the beginning of that hockey stick growth where it's like we had been growing, we had been doing well, and then you zoom out and you're like, okay, that was very clearly the thing we were missing. Yet again, we had to stop what we were doing, we rebuilt the entire app, we built it around RSS and podcasting and being able to export. And we actually did some really cool things to make it really easy for people to publish their podcast everywhere. So I think that was really the moment that it took off. And I think it's so interesting putting those two things together because it was the opposite thing the second time that we had to give up on a piece of what we had thought was so inherently true about our business.

Maya Prohovnik (00:28:28):
And so I don't know what lesson to tell people to take away from that other than I think you have to just stay, especially in a startup mentality, you have to stay willing to be flexible and take in new information and new data points as your product matures and as your user base changes, there's going to be new things that you learn that are going to change how you think about it. And I think again, the one thing that was unwavering for us was our mission and everything else was mutable for us where we were like, whatever we need to do to get there will work. And I do think looking back, it's astonishing how brave we were that we kept finding some product market fit and being like, nope, that's not enough. And then moving to the next thing. And I think that obviously worked out really well for us and meant that we were able to do what we set out to do and really democratize the medium and make things a lot easier for a lot more people.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I think another lesson there is just try stuff. Like you said, you tried this export thing, let's just see what happens. No, we don't think this is where we need to go, but let's just try it and maybe it'll work. And clearly that became the core of the product and platform.

Maya Prohovnik (00:29:27):
Totally. And also, you never know which of those tiny product changes are going to end up being this existential moment for your business. You really have to keep your eyes open and be ready for that to happen anytime, especially when you're still trying to figure out where your place is going to be.

Lenny (00:29:42):
You mentioned there was this feature that made it easy to distribute your podcast, and this touches on a question that actually asked Mike Mignano, the CEO of anchor what to ask you. And he's like, ask her about the story of how you made that actually possible to distribute the podcast to platforms, and it ended up being a very unscalable solution.

Maya Prohovnik (00:30:00):
One of our principles from the very early days of Anchor was build things that don't scale, where we were like, we're a ridiculously tiny team. We're trying to do this really big thing. We had raised very little money, and so we were always just trying to figure out how can we hack into whatever growth we're trying to make happen. So when it turned out that people wanted to distribute their podcasts everywhere, it's gotten a little bit easier. But at the time, I'm sure you remember what podcast distribution was like, where it's like there's all of these different podcast platforms you have to manually distribute to all of them. Apple Podcasts in particular can be really difficult for people who aren't tech-savvy because there's this whole, you have to prove that you own your RSS feed, you have to know what an RSS feed is.

Maya Prohovnik (00:30:44):
You have to sometimes deal with 301 redirects. There's just all this stuff that's deeply technical in a way that we were just like it doesn't need to be. And so one of the steps there was to submit your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you had to have an Apple ID, and there are a lot of people in the world who don't have iPhones, and so we're building for everybody. So we were like, how can we reduce that friction? We were obsessed with reducing friction, this was our constant battle. And so we had this idea, we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this.

Maya Prohovnik (00:31:27):
I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts. And that resulted in lots of interesting technical and relationship situations. It was a really interesting thing, and eventually that didn't scale, eventually we stopped doing that, obviously, but I think that is such a cool example of the importance of how you're packaging what you're offering to people where if we had said you request distribution and we'll have one of our team members get back to you in three days and let you know when you're on Apple Podcasts, that doesn't feel very magical or it's really saving you any time. If all you see as a user is you're hitting a button and then 24 hours later you're somehow magically on Apple Podcasts, that was so much easier than manual distribution was at the time.

Maya Prohovnik (00:32:20):
And I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point. So, it's funny now to think back on that, but I think it's also related to we were so good at being willing to humor what seemed like stupid ideas and try them. And so that is something that I definitely recommend to product people is let yourself have the silly ideas we always talked about yes and when someone has an idea, how can you build on it and think about how it might work instead of saying, no, that can't work because, and so we had a number of those things where it was like nobody understood how we were doing things so differently, and it was just because we weren't afraid to do the silly unscalable thing for a while.

Lenny (00:33:08):
I love that story. Touches on two things, one is I was just doing an interview around how to drive word to mouth growth and make that a big driver of your growth. And the main message there is just make something remarkable and knock people's socks off that they're just like, oh wow, this is crazy, I'm going to share it with my friend. And that's such a good example of that where everyone's like, wow, that was easy, I'm going to tell all my other friends that are launching podcasts. The other is, I wonder just how much of tech is built off of college interns, the beginnings of companies or how important college interns are to technology and innovation. It feels like there's always an intern story.

Maya Prohovnik (00:33:42):
Yeah, I know. I think they must be. And for the record, we paid them very well, these were not unpaid interns, just to be clear. But no, I think it is amazing, and I think it was also such a cool opportunity. One of those interns actually is still a PM on my team today. She ended up converting a full-time after she graduated. And I remember I had a lot of cool college internships and it's such a cool way to get exposure to industries that you otherwise wouldn't get to. So I would definitely recommend that college kids start with, it's okay if your first job is like a repetitive, not very exciting thing. If you do a good job, it will lead to something very exciting maybe.

Lenny (00:34:15):
I love that. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn and Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

Lenny (00:35:14):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. So we've been talking about Anchor and I think what's really interesting about Anchor is it's one of the very rare success stories of an acquisition working out incredibly well. It was a small startup now powering two thirds of all new podcasts. It's pretty insane. So I want to spend a little time on just what worked in making that possible. So let me ask first around the integration piece, just how you integrated successfully, and then I want to talk about just operationalizing and making it continue running successfully.

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:03):
Totally.

Lenny (00:36:04):
Yeah. So on the first piece, just what did you do right to integrate Anchor into Spotify to make it effective and continue working?

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:10):
I think it's a combination of luck and hard work because Spotify is genuinely an amazing company. I mean, you've met now a bunch of people who I work with at Spotify, including my boss, Gustav. It's an incredible company. They're Swedish. So just their mindset about everything in the first place is amazing. But also, I have been so impressed that they are the type of company that can still move quickly and make really big strategic decisions and strategic shifts. It never feels like they're slowing down. And so I think our way of working worked with them. And then I think the other thing that we had to our benefit was they really saw the same vision that we had. So it was like they also wanted to change podcasting and make it more democratized and make it more two-way and bring it into the future.

Maya Prohovnik (00:36:53):
And it was so interesting because when we started talking to them, both of us had this chicken or egg marketplace problem where we had this critical mass of creators. They had a critical mass at that point of consumers, but if you don't have both on the same place, then you're still stuck with the limitations of RSS feeds. And so I think we were both coming at the acquisition with the same frustration just from two different angles. And so both of us really saw that benefit in joining up. And so I think one of the big ways we were lucky is that what I've seen happen in a lot of acquisitions is you have an idea of what you're getting acquired for and you get excited and really attached to that vision, and then when that vision doesn't end up fitting into the company strategy, there's nowhere else to go.

Maya Prohovnik (00:37:34):
And I think in a lot of ways Anchor did really well fit into Spotify's culture and their roadmap, but there were many things that changed around that initial vision. And I think we were really good at making sure that we stayed valuable to Spotify. That was one of our goals when we got acquired where we were like, we're tiny startup people, and we're like, we're not going to get lost in this big sea. When we came in, it was like we were very vocal about everything that we were doing, we did lots of internal marketing and made sure people were excited. We built a lot of really strong relationships. We made sure that every team at Spotify knew about us and what we were doing. We were constantly asking how we could help other teams. And when the strategy shifted, which it has dozens of times since we've gotten acquired almost five years ago, not like we just blindly followed, but we were always willing to get excited about whatever the next thing was and willing to be helpful and figure out how to make that work.

Maya Prohovnik (00:38:30):
And I think it actually goes back to the sticking to the mission in the first place where Spotify and we want podcasting to be able to be a huge business for the industry. We think it's been held back by a lot of things for a long time. And so we've had various hypotheses about how we can get there and we try things and if something doesn't work, we go onto the next thing. But that goal hasn't really changed.

Lenny (00:38:55):
That makes a lot of sense. And I love the idea of just staying excited about what is happening. I think a lot of founders join and they're like, "Oh, it's so annoying to work in this big company." "Oh man, we have this original plan, it's just not happening." And I think even if you're probably not, even if you're not excited, I think it's effective to communicate that you're excited and be on board and then shift things in what direction you think maybe needs to go instead.

Maya Prohovnik (00:39:19):
Totally, yeah.

Lenny (00:39:20):
Okay. And then in terms of operating within Spotify, from what I understand, your team is still very startupy and there's this really fast moving mentality. What have you learned and how do you do that? How do you make that happen within a larger company?

Maya Prohovnik (00:39:34):
We've definitely slowed down a little, I will say. I'm always joking about when we first got acquired, I remember we had to do this spreadsheet outlining our roadmap and estimate are things like small, extra large, whatever, and Spotify's definition of small with something like a quarter. And I was like, we've never built anything that took more than three months. And now it's like now we build lots of things to take more than three months. But the first thing that comes to mind, so when we were a startup, one of the first things we did when we were only a few people, we decided what our core values were going to be. And I think they maybe very trivially have changed over the years, but we essentially still have the same four core values that we decided on seven or eight years ago now. And when we got acquired, we had a conversation with our team where we said, we're going to of course embrace Spotify's culture and Spotify's core values, but we're not going to forget who we are as a team.

Maya Prohovnik (00:40:28):
And I think part of what really... And one of our core values by the way, is move fast. So that's something that's very deep within our DNA. But I think one of the things that helped with that is Daniel Eck, when we got acquired, came and talked to our team, which was so cool and so motivational. And one of the things he said to us was, we had a reputation at the time for moving very quickly, even compared to other startups. We were shipping a new feature every two weeks, it was insane. And Daniel said to us, not only do I want you to not move slower, that's part of why we're acquiring you so that you can move quickly. But he said, I also want you to help me teach the rest of Spotify how to move more quickly, and I found that so motivating.

Maya Prohovnik (00:41:04):
Because I think I definitely had that feeling going from startup to larger organization where I had this fear that it was just going to be bureaucracy and things moving so slowly. And I really loved that. That was one of his goals was that he was like, I want to make sure Spotify also grew really quickly and he was trying to figure out how to help them keep moving as quickly as they used to. And so I think that's something that I really took to heart and that I've continued to remind my team of even to this day where I think of that as part of my job here to help people think about how we can move quickly and what really matters. And I think at any large organization, there's obviously a lot more complexities, there's a lot more stakeholders.

Maya Prohovnik (00:41:42):
So to some extent it's necessary to slow down and be thoughtful. But I think the things that I always try to push people on is the unnecessary things that slow you down. So I think that's what we spend a lot of time on, both within our team and when we're collaborating with other teams at Spotify because we work with basically everyone at this point. So I think that was really cool that he gave us that mission when we joined.

Lenny (00:42:03):
On that note, is there anything that has been a real challenge or become really annoying? Just real talk about the flip side of that. Everyone's always like, "Oh, it's all working out great." Is there anything you could share that's just like, "Oh wow, that was really hard and we overcame it, or a real challenge that we didn't expect?"

Maya Prohovnik (00:42:19):
I think that the downside of Daniel's advice, so one of the things he said to us, he was literally say no to all the meetings. You're going to get invited to all these off sites and meetings and everyone's going to want to meet you guys and they're going to want you to come to all of these events and whatever. And he was like, just keep being Anchor. Just keep doing what you're doing for at least the next year. Don't worry about what Spotify's doing. And on the one hand, of course, we loved that as startup people we're like, cool, we're going to get to stay us within this larger organization. But the downside that we didn't really realize until a year later was that we weren't really able to build relationships. We had some culture problems where our team started to feel like because they weren't part of Spotify, they had some existential, they didn't feel attached to the work that we were doing.

Maya Prohovnik (00:43:03):
And so for a year we operated on our own. We moved really quickly, we were able to get a lot done, but then I think our next phase had to be really deeply incorporating into Spotify. And so we stopped calling our team Anchor internally, we started collaborating more with other teams. And I think that is the necessary trade-off is the more deeply you're embedded, the slower things are going to go. But I think that has been really amazing for making sure that our team actually felt like a part of the larger mission that Spotify was doing. And the one other thing I'll say that I found pretty striking. So, Spotify, as you know, did a lot of podcast acquisitions soon after the Anchor one. And so I got to know a lot of the other founders and early employees who have been acquired by Spotify and something that I've found with them and just with other acquired founders who I've talked to since, I don't know, I feel like people don't talk about this enough publicly.

Maya Prohovnik (00:43:59):
Maybe people are somewhere and I just haven't seen it. I think that people who get acquired, especially founders, actually go through a relatively deep depression and existential crisis after getting acquired. And I never would've thought, when you're talking to people about getting acquired, it sounds like such an obvious positive. Like you said, it's like this amazing positive exit and it was objectively so good for our team and for us and for our users, and I think for the industry. And I personally did not expect to go through that. Because I was like of course you want an exit, that's what you're working towards that whole time that you're a startup. And I've talked to a lot of these founders and I think it is a process I think that everyone has to go through because either you decide I'm going to stay here and I'm going to do this for a long time and I can make this work for me.

Maya Prohovnik (00:44:44):
Or you're like, I'm just a startup founder and this doesn't really work for me and I'm going to go do my next thing. And so I think to some extent some of the things we were talking about, I think do help shake out whether people actually want to make those investments and figure out how to make things work at a big company. But I think the other thing that I've found is just I think there isn't enough support for that transition. And I think that for me, I've definitely landed on the side of, I love working at Spotify. I now am so excited to be part of a large organization and building things at this scale, but I really would've loved to been able to talk to someone about it or understand that there were other people going through that kind of thing.

Maya Prohovnik (00:45:25):
So I don't know if you want an example of how it's not all rainbows and sunshine, I definitely think there were some dark times there and I've since learned everyone goes through that just because I think just by definition, all the reasons that you start a company, that means your personality is someone who wants to be having that direct impact and having your own ownership and being able to make things move quickly, and that is just so different once you join a large organization.

Lenny (00:45:54):
Yeah, and those are amazing examples. I think what's interesting with startup life is eventually if things work out well, you'll either end up working for a larger company, that's a likely scenario if things tip go great or you're running a public company, which is also extremely painful and stressful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:46:11):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:46:12):
Yeah. So, the paths are hard no matter what you end up doing, as much as you love that startup time. I actually went through the same thing when we sold our company to Airbnb. I was just like, man, I had this life goal of starting a company and now I've done it and now what do I do? And it was just like, huh, okay, I guess I got to figure it out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:46:29):
Right? It's like, who am I? And I think the thing that I think for me, and it sounds similar to you, I think I didn't realize how much value I put in the actual day-to-day of survival that comes with being part of a startup. That becomes almost your reason for being is like, I got to make this work and I got to keep the team motivated. And you're just going, going, going, and then when everything is suddenly stable, you're like, wait, what is my job now?

Lenny (00:46:57):
I saw a tweet actually recently, I forget who tweeted this, that CEOs that exit and go on vacation end up being more stressed and less healthy than running a really high stress, high growth company.

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:08):
That is wild. I get it though.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Yeah. Although I will say when I joined Airbnb and was just the PM of our team working on one thing, it was like, this is really cool. I don't have to worry about everything all the time, there's a really nice relief to that. But yeah, there's a life existential question of just like, wow, we did the thing. What am I? What else? There's usually not a goal beyond that.

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:31):
Totally.

Lenny (00:47:32):
What was it for you? Was it that, was it the feeling of I had this thing that I was running and now I don't?

Maya Prohovnik (00:47:37):
I think it was a little bit the fear of being like a cog in a wheel, which is not actually how I feel now that I work at Spotify. And I think the other was like we were doing great, we already were killing it at podcast hosting. And also it was just so fun. I really valued that small company, everyone knows each other. We're doing really hard work, but we're also having so much fun. And I think it felt like I couldn't translate that to a large organization where I was like, okay, now I have to do things how they do. And then I think what actually ended up happening is I actually love how Spotify runs their company and I'm still able to run my team the way that works for me. And so I think it just goes back to knowing what you care about, being really solidly attached to your own core values and being able to take that with you.

Lenny (00:48:25):
I think we're both examples of people that were startup people and then realized it's not so bad working at a big company. I stayed at Airbnb for seven years. I was like, no, no way, I'm going to be here for more than a year and a half or a year or two. How long have you been at Spotify? At this point?

Maya Prohovnik (00:48:37):
I'm going on five years. Yeah.

Lenny (00:48:41):
No, I think this is just a example of it's you think you're not going to enjoy working at a larger company, but oftentimes it's actually pretty great for a lot of different reasons.

Maya Prohovnik (00:48:48):
Yes.

Lenny (00:48:49):
Shifting in a slightly different direction, just thinking about leadership and what you've learned to lead teams, lead large orgs, build products, is there any just, I don't know, frameworks or tools that you found to be effective?

Maya Prohovnik (00:49:05):
The big one for me is Radical Candor. And I know my team watching this is going to laugh at me because I talk about this every day. They're tired of hearing it, but have you read it?

Lenny (00:49:15):
I have. I love it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:49:17):
Yeah. It's my all time favorite book. And I think it really shifted for me, honestly how I relate to people in general. But I think especially with managing, giving feedback, being able to collaborate and push back in a direct way, direct and constructive way on peers and that sort of thing. So I make all of my managers on my team read it. We talk about it constantly in our team, and I think that the general concepts for anyone who's not familiar is you need to care personally and challenge directly. And if you're only doing one of those things, you're not giving feedback in an effective way. And the book just talks so much about the importance of feedback and how feedback is a gift, which I have now come to completely agree with. It's like anytime I've given someone effective feedback, it's always well received, even if it's tough to hear, people want to get better and they want to know how they can improve.

Maya Prohovnik (00:50:07):
And so I think anytime that you can give them specific feedback in a way that makes it clear that you care about them and want them to be able to reach their goals, I think it makes them stronger, it makes your relationship stronger. And I also think the one other big thing I took away from Radical Candor was when it comes to people not underperforming, it really reframed how I think about that because people are not generally inherently bad or lazy or ineffective, it's almost always because the role they're in is the wrong fit. And so being able to approach the conversation in that way means that you can come at it and in a caring way that lets them know you actually want them to be successful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:50:47):
And what I found is when you have the conversation in that way, they're much more receptive to it. And then you're able to either actually resolve the issues or you're able to help them figure out what the right fit is for them, which I think as a manager, it's so inspiring to me because that means that you get to keep mentoring them beyond. You're not just saying, this isn't working, I'm giving up on you, see you later. You're saying, I'm committed to helping you throughout your whole career and let's help you find the next step, even if that isn't on my team or at this company.

Lenny (00:51:16):
Awesome. Yeah, I love that book. And you talked about the two. There's this grid that-

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:21):
The quadrants?

Lenny (00:51:22):
Yeah, it talks about. And just to reinforce what you just said, the core is that when you want to give people direct feedback, but you want to make it clear you care deeply about them. And I love that she talks about if you do one of these wrong, here's what happens. If you challenge directly, but it doesn't feel like you care deeply, you're just an asshole and they're just like, yeah, God, you get really defensive. I should get her on this podcast. How cool would that be?

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:43):
Oh my God, that would be my, she's my... If I could meet one tech celebrity, it would be her.

Lenny (00:51:48):
Okay. I'm going to work on it. If you're listening and you're Kim Scott, let me know, I will try to get to her. Anything else in that bucket of frameworks or tools, things that you find really helpful leadership?

Maya Prohovnik (00:51:58):
The only other one, I'm not a huge framework person. I think this goes back to my gut thing, but the one other thing that I refer to often is I love the Eisenhower Matrix, which is also known as the four Ds. So it's do, defer, delegate, delete, you have also quadrants. Maybe my brain just works in quadrants. I don't know. But I totally subscribe to that and that's how I do everything, where I write everything down at the end of every day, I go through and I either do delegate, defer, delete, and it really helps you clear a lot of stuff out of your brain.

Lenny (00:52:27):
Interesting. So you don't even use it as a grid necessarily, it's more make a decision on all the things on your plate?

Maya Prohovnik (00:52:34):
Yeah, I do. I just tried using the grid view and it didn't work for me for some reason. So I just use a to-do list, and then I don't let myself finish working until I've gone through anything I didn't get through that day, and then I know what I have to do the next day.

Lenny (00:52:46):
So that touches on another area I wanted to touch on, which is productivity. I hear you're very good at being productive and making the use of your time. I guess one, where do you think that comes from? And then two, just any other tips, tactics, tools you find to be really effective in staying productive?

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:01):
Yeah, where does that come from? I think I am OCD. I think I'm an overachiever. I don't know, it's really important to me. I think when my team says that I'm very productive, the feedback I hear from them is they're impressed that they send me a doc and then I always read it. I think that's more about prioritizing my team and making sure that they're unblocked, which I take very seriously. I don't know other tips that I would give people. I write everything down because I think I'm one of those people I remember things best when they're written down and then I obsessively put things on my to-do list. Anything that anyone asks me to do goes on there, and then I have that method for organizing it later in the day.

Lenny (00:53:38):
Do you have an app for this or do you write it on paper?

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:40):
I use Todoist. I think you can use any, but it's the one that works best for me. I love using paper, but then if I don't have it with me, then I can't remember anything I have to do, so I've had to go digital.

Lenny (00:53:51):
Awesome. So it sounds like a big part of your process is just getting things out of your head and writing it down somewhere.

Maya Prohovnik (00:53:56):
Yes. I think that's huge. And I also think if you're in any sort of job, I think most PMs have this where it's so much of your job is actually deep thinking and problem solving. I just cannot get that done if I'm running through my to-do list in my head. So I think that was a big unlock for me when I realized that I just needed to, anytime I'm stressed, honestly, if I just sit and make a list of all the things I have to do, I'm like, oh, it's four things, I can get those done, it's okay.

Lenny (00:54:18):
Man, that tool of just making a list when you're stressed about, all the things you got to do, just making a list of it on paper, I find it so helpful.

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:27):
It works every time.

Lenny (00:54:28):
Have you read Getting Things Done by David Allen?

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:31):
It's on my list. I haven't read it.

Lenny (00:54:32):
Okay. That book totally transformed how I think about productivity, and you already doing a lot of what he recommends. It's like this very old book. And now he's just, I don't know, he's a public speaker dude that just goes around consulting. But this one, it has very simple approaches to being productive and it really changed the way I operate. And you're already doing a lot of it, so I don't know how much value you get out of it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:54:53):
I'll read it. I love this stuff.

Lenny (00:54:55):
A core concept is this idea of mind like water where you don't want to have anything in your head, you want to get it all out. And then there's these systems for how to process all the things you're getting out.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:04):
Totally.

Lenny (00:55:05):
Maybe we'll get David Allen this. We got a whole list.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:07):
I know we have a whole hit list.

Lenny (00:55:10):
Maybe it's just a final question. You're good at so many things, another thing you're really good at is public speaking. I was watching the last Spotify launch event and I was just like, holy moly, she's incredibly good at speaking and it's something I want to get better at and something I think a 100% of people want to get better at. So, I'm just curious, what have you learned about being an effective public speaker? Anything that you could recommend to people if they're trying to get better at this?

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:32):
Well, first of all, thank you for saying I'm awesome at so many things. This is my favorite podcast I've ever been on, you're just complimenting me the whole time, so I'll take it.

Lenny (00:55:39):
True.

Maya Prohovnik (00:55:41):
I think with public speaking, for me, the first thing that I had to do was decide that I didn't hate public speaking because I think it's human nature. It makes sense that we do not want to be in front of a crowd and we don't want to be performing. And it's just an unnatural thing that humans, I think make ourselves do. I remember actually when I was in high school, I had to give a presentation and I had so much anxiety I couldn't sleep the night before. And I remember I was getting ready for school that morning and I was like, I'm just not going to hate public speaking. I just can't get through my life feeling this way. And so I just got up there and I had fun with it, and it felt so much better to not feel worried about it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:56:18):
So I think ever since then I've been okay at it. And then I have gotten lots of opportunities to do big scary public speaking things for Spotify, and so I think I've had to get even better. I think my tips would be my biggest one is probably reframing. Everyone has this anxiety before they have to perform or they go on stage. Reframing that anxiety to understand that the thing your body is doing is surging you with adrenaline to help you. And so letting that feeling wash over you instead of fighting it, I think has been so effective for me because otherwise, it can feel like a panic attack. And so I think you have to be like, cool, my body's getting ready. We're excited, we're going to go do this on stage. That has been really helpful. I practice a million times anytime I have to do public speaking.

Maya Prohovnik (00:57:03):
So I think everybody has different memorization tactics, different ways of doing speaker notes that work for them. And so I think part of it is you have to do a bunch of public speaking to see what works for you. So some people work best with no notes. I almost read complete sentences a good, I can enunciate things while I'm reading, so that works best for me. Some people like bullets and then they go a little bit off the script. But I think once you figure out what method of speaker notes works for you, I rehearse probably at least 10 times all the way through once the speaker notes are final. And you can practice your exact delivery. You can practice where you're going to put jokes in. You can figure out what doesn't feel natural or where you're going to trip it up, and then you can change the words that you're using.

Maya Prohovnik (00:57:42):
And so I like to get to the point where I can remember ad-lib at least half of the notes that I have in there, and that way I know I'm going to feel confident coming off script. I make a lot of eye contact with the audience, which I think makes them think that I'm not reading speaker notes. So I think that's really important. If you can stand it, which I can't, record yourself or watch yourself in a mirror, it messes me up more. But I think for a lot of people, that can be really helpful to figure out where your issues are. I think the biggest thing for me honestly, is that the unfair advantage I have is if you really give a shit about what you're talking about, you are going to be such a better presenter because people are going to be able to tell that you care.

Maya Prohovnik (00:58:20):
And so I think even at a larger Spotify event where it's like I'm reading off a teleprompter and I'm reading, I'm marketing, but I'm helping write those words and then the way that I'm saying them matters because I'm talking to podcasters and I'm like, my mission in life is to make things better for you, not everyone gets that benefit, I guess. Sometimes you have to do public speaking about things that you're not very passionate about, but I certainly think that helps. And I think leaning into that, so when you can, telling personal stories, letting the audience get to know you, I like to work some humor into my presentations. I think that can really help as well.

Lenny (00:58:55):
That is awesome advice. I especially love letting the stress wash over you, because most of has this challenge. Your body's just doing all this shit that's just going to stress the shit out of you. And so the idea of just embracing it, just flowing with it.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:10):
Yes, it's a superpower. It's like, that's so cool, that adrenaline works that way.

Lenny (00:59:14):
Yeah. Okay. I'm going to try that one.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:16):
Also, if you're nervous, you can put your hands above your head that'll help the blood, I don't know, it helps it go into your head or something. I don't remember.

Lenny (00:59:23):
There's this whole power post thing that apparently has-

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:26):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:59:26):
I think it's been disproven. People are like, no, there's no data that shows that. But the blood thing that's really interesting versus psychological benefits.

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:34):
I think there is a real physiological thing that happens.

Lenny (00:59:36):
That's cool. Okay. Amazing. Okay. Maybe as an actual last question, what's happening in the future of the Spotify podcasting platform? Anything you want to share about where things are going?

Maya Prohovnik (00:59:45):
A lot of the things that I talked about at Stream on for anyone who saw that this year, I think are still very much our strategy. So I think for us in general, Spotify is really focused on making sure that we can... We have a massive audience, we have more than 500 million monthly active listeners. We want to help podcast creators reach that global audience, and so it's really important to us. I always tell my team the biggest problem that I want to solve for podcasters is discovery and audience growth, and I really think we can be the ones to do it, so I'm really excited about that. So discovery, monetization. We're really focused on making sure that creators of all shapes and sizes can make a living off of their work.

Maya Prohovnik (01:00:24):
And then I think in general, we're working on so many cool things at Spotify to make podcasts a more interactive format, something that allows you to get to know your audience and connect with your fan base. We talked about a couple features this past year. I definitely can't say anything specific, but what I can say is there is lots of really cool stuff coming next year that I'm very excited about. And I would say for anyone who wants to learn more, definitely sign up for Spotify for podcasters. It works whether you're hosted with Spotify or not, and you can start to get a sense of some of those features that we're opening up to everybody, but there's lots more cool stuff to come.

Lenny (01:00:58):
Amazing, mysterious, and exciting. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:05):
Yes.

Lenny (01:01:06):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:09):
Children of Time, and I guess I would say It by Stephen King. I recommend a lot of Stephen King books, but that's my all time favorite.

Lenny (01:01:16):
Very on brand with your podcasts. Makes sense. What is a recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Maya Prohovnik (01:01:23):
TV show, I'll just say, I guess Pokerface was the last one that really blew my mind. Movies, I mean, Barbie was so good, and then I'll just give you a lesser known one. I just watched this crazy movie from the '80s that was made the same year Home Alone was, this just got featured on a podcast, so I think everybody's talking about it now, but it's a horror movie about a kid who's home alone, and then he has to fight Santa Claus in a home invasion situation. It is so good, it has a bunch of different names, but if you look up either Game Over or it's like Code Père Noël or something, it's an old French horror movie, so good.

Lenny (01:01:59):
Interesting that the other Home Alone is the one that did well in this one.

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:02):
Well, there was apparently a whole legal thing over it.

Lenny (01:02:05):
Oh, wow. They didn't have Macaulay Culkin. That's their missing piece. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing?

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:14):
I have one. It is, if you could make a podcast about anything, what would it be? And it is the best. Honestly, you should ask people that even if you don't work in work in podcasting, because it tells you so much about candidates, and one thing that I feel very strongly is that the most important thing is that you're hiring passionate people, not people who are passionate necessarily about the thing that you're doing, but about anything. If they can't think of anything, that's a red flag for me.

Lenny (01:02:33):
That's awesome. It's like a variation of the question of Teach me something or tell me about something that you've learned recently. Really interesting tweak on that question and very appropriate. What is a favorite product or something awesome you've discovered recently that you really like digital or physical?

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:49):
Okay. Very unsexy answer, but I love 1-800-CONTACTS.

Lenny (01:02:53):
Okay.

Maya Prohovnik (01:02:54):
I'm so impressed with their product team. If you need new contacts, even if you need a new prescription, you can do the whole thing online in five minutes, and it's so well-thought-out and so thoughtful. I love them. And then the one other one I'll give a shout-out to, since becoming a parent, Love Every, do you subscribe to them?

Lenny (01:03:09):
Absolutely. I don't know anyone that doesn't have them.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:12):
I know. It's so good.

Lenny (01:03:12):
They've cracked it.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:14):
Yes.

Lenny (01:03:15):
Yeah. We are missing some of the toys, and so we're trying to find where they went because he's ready for the rattle.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:25):
Yes. Awesome.

Lenny (01:03:25):
Yeah. I love everybody's amazing and their ads are really great. Oh, man.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:27):
Yes. They're so good.

Lenny (01:03:29):
What is a favorite life motto that you come back to often share with folks? Anything there?

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:36):
"Only a fool wishes time away." Even if you're having a bad day, even if you're doing something boring or you're stressed, you have to do public speaking, that's still your life and you should enjoy it.

Lenny (01:03:47):
I love that. There's this phrase of just like, I'm just killing time right now, and I always think about that, just like, oh, but you don't have that much time. Maybe you shouldn't try to kill yourself.

Maya Prohovnik (01:03:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:58):
Even though sometimes things are boring, it reminds me of another quote of just, "Most of the world's problems are caused by our inability to sit in a room for 10 minutes quietly."

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:07):
Yes. Also, if you're bored, have a baby because you'll never be bored again.

Lenny (01:04:11):
Yeah. Yep, indeed. Speaking of parenting, what is a valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:18):
My mom always told me that my generosity would be rewarded, so anytime that I was nice or thought of someone else before me, she always made sure that I got some little reward or got to go out for ice cream or something, I think that really worked on me.

Lenny (01:04:34):
I love that. Final question, I saw somewhere that you raised bait backyard chickens. Is that true?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:40):
I'm so happy you asked about my chickens'.

Lenny (01:04:43):
I love that reaction. So maybe just why did you decide to do that and any tips for someone that may want to explore it?

Maya Prohovnik (01:04:48):
Oh my God. Well, we should have started with this because I can talk about this for an hour and a half, but I love my chickens. I have eight of them, we've got one rooster and seven hens. I think that all of us should be a little bit closer to nature, to the, I was going to say, the food that we're eating, I'm not going to eat my chickens, but they make eggs for me. But I just think there is something very lacking in our modern lives, that connection to nature. When I feel stressed at work and I go outside and I hang out with my chickens, I pet them, and I give them treats and we talk to each other. It's like nothing makes me happier and feel more grounded than hanging out with my chickens. So I think everyone should have chickens. I would say they're pretty low maintenance, so if you're thinking about it, I would recommend it. And if you get chickens, my favorite thing that I did for them, I got this monthly subscription box for chickens I think it's called Coop Crate.

Lenny (01:05:40):
Love Every for Chickens.

Maya Prohovnik (01:05:41):
Yes, it's Love Every for Chickens and every month they send me chicken treats, but also fun little things for crazy chicken people, so it's clothes or a sticker, something funny.I'm very into the whole chicken thing, so, yeah.

Lenny (01:05:55):
Oh my God. Maybe just a tactical question, how much space do you need in your yard for chickens?

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:00):
Not that much, so we let them free-range. We have a pretty big yard, but I think their actual, so there's their little coop, and then they've got a run that's fenced in. The run is maybe like, I don't know, five feet by eight feet or something, but you can go a lot smaller. If you go to Home Depot, they actually sell pre-made coops and runs. I think if you have a decent sized backyard, they'll be fine. I've known people with pretty small yards, and you just let your chickens out and they're happy and they'll find worms in a few yards.

Lenny (01:06:27):
Oh man. All right. A new project to look into.

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:29):
Please get chickens, do it.

Lenny (01:06:31):
Okay. Maya, we've talked about chickens, dogfooding, gut level decisions, Radical Candor, so many things. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:43):
I'm on threads, I guess, and I'm on LinkedIn. I'm Maya Fish on most social media, and then I'm on LinkedIn, and then, what was the second one? How can people be useful to me?

Lenny (01:06:53):
Exactly.

Maya Prohovnik (01:06:55):
Listen to your podcast on Spotify, and then send me your feedback. I would love to know either as a podcast creator or as a podcast listener. Always happy to hear what Spotify can be doing more of or better to help you out.

Lenny (01:07:06):
Amazing. Maya, thank you so much for being here.

# Unconventional product lessons from Binance, N26, Google, more | Mayur Kamat (CPO at N26)

## Transcript

Mayur Kamat (00:00:00):
My, probably, most spectacular failure was, I was the first PM on Hangouts. We had thousands of people working for me. We had entire power of Google. We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do and we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product. The main learnings from that is, don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro. The challenge with being a product manager is, everybody thinks they can do the job. Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas, so at some point in time, you're like, "What is my discipline? What is my science?" The moment you build experimentation, you've now made it scientific.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
A lot of new people in their career are like, "Oh, I just want to think about strategy. I'm going to think about the big picture."

Mayur Kamat (00:00:45):
Strategy is a little bit overrated for product. For most product managers, your strategy should be, "How fast can I go from hypothesis to data?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today, my guest is Mayur Kamat. Mayur is Chief Product Officer at N26, one of the most successful fintech startups in the world and which, in my research, came in amongst the top five companies in the world who are hiring and producing the best product managers. Prior to N26, Mayur was Global Head of Product at Binance, VP of product at Agoda, which is over a $100 billion dollar company based in Thailand, and a PM at Google and Microsoft. In our wide-ranging conversation, Mayur shares what he's learned about hiring and developing great product managers, what he learned from his time working at Binance, which, as you'll soon hear, was one of the wildest and most unique ways of working, what he learned from the failure of Google's early attempts at Hangouts, where he was the first PM. Also, the pros and cons of working in Asia versus Europe versus the US, and why you should be starting your career on the West Coast of the US. Also, why comp early in your career does not matter and so much more.

(00:01:47):

(00:02:14):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.

(00:02:45):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth Zero and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workOS.com to learn more. That's workOS. com.

(00:03:33):
Many of you are building AI products, which is why I am very excited to chat with Brandon Foo, Founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey, Brandon.

Brandon Foo (00:03:41):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
Integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?

Brandon Foo (00:03:48):
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:07):
Where does Paragon fit into all this?

Brandon Foo (00:04:09):
These integrations are a pain to build. That's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:23):
I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.

Brandon Foo (00:04:27):
Exactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts on competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/Lenny.

(00:04:49):
Mayur, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Mayur Kamat (00:04:56):
Thank you. This is super exciting. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):
I want to start with your time at Binance. You've worked at Google, you worked at Microsoft, you worked at a company called Agoda. Now, you're at N26. I imagine Binance was the most unique place that you've worked at, and I've also never heard much about what it's like to work at a company like Binance. I was just looking them up on Wikipedia. I saw they started in China, they moved to Japan, they moved to Malta. Now, they have no official headquarters. What was it just like working at Binance? How was it most unique from other places you've worked?

Mayur Kamat (00:05:31):
Yeah. Maybe just a background for Binance, because I think a lot of people have heard it, some in positive connotations, some not so much. The scale of Binance is pretty mind-boggling. Just to give the history, they started in 2017 as a crypto exchange, when there were other crypto exchange on the market for years, like Coinbase. Within six months, they became number one. That's unprecedented. That's like launching a search engine today, and then, six months later, beating Google. Then they went within five years to at a peak valuation of somewhere like $400 billion or so with 2000 employees. That's zero to $400 billion in five years. It's at a scale that's never been done before. Google couldn't do it, Facebook, none of the names that you hear. It's remarkable. When I was there as the head of product, my top line KPI was the trading volume, and my monthly KPI was in trillions of dollars.

(00:06:35):
Just the scale was mind-boggling. We had teams of 10, 20 people running multi-billion dollar profit businesses. That brings in with it, first, how did they do that to that scale, and two, what kind of culture requires to keep that running? Both are very fascinating. I think we could spend a lot of time talking about it, but the truly interesting thing, the first one is, you can't do this by having a traditional log structure. CZ, the founder and CEO at one point had 55 direct reports, and his direct reports had about the similar ones. For a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO. That leads to an extreme level of decision-making and execution. You cannot have one-on-ones when you have 55 direct reports, so there's a culture of one-to-many and doing that as often as possible.

(00:07:33):
The leadership team, for example, met every day, and because the leadership team was spread across the world, we met at 11:00 PM when I was in Singapore every day. That includes the weekends, holidays. The leadership team was there, 11:00 PM every single day, which meant that none of the decisions were blocked for more than 24 hours. Most of them, we made it on chat even within those 24 hours, but if there was something big, it was escalated, decided. We executed largely based on this concept that I now take with me. I call it running products via daily meeting. We would pick a owner for something really urgent at the nightly leadership call. Then that owner would be expected to have all hands on deck for however long that problem is every single day and then report the updates on the daily call. Some of these were really massive topics, like how do we get 15 financial licenses in 15 countries in the next three months? It wouldn't be at a scale that was-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:43):
You've got 24 hours.

Mayur Kamat (00:08:45):
Yes, and people did it. It's extremely interesting to see that when you have really smart people, you give them really hard problems, you have no constraints on what can you need to solve them, whether it's money, people, except time. Time is always at a premium. People can move mountains in a small amount of time. That extreme ownership culture, I think, probably was the most fascinating part of working at Binance that I've now tried to take. There's some good parts of it in terms of attention to detail, being able to pick certain areas and own it, irrespective of what your title is and how many people report to you. There are certain downsides in terms of the amount of randomization that it can cost teams, especially if it's not super well-thought through. I'm trying to see what are the great parts of that that I can bring to different roles, but that concept of daily meeting, if there's something super urgent, how can you own it directly and run it yourself, where you are in the details so your team knows that they need to be in the details, and then be able to execute that. That's probably the most fascinating. There's several war stories. I was there for two years and the amount of interesting stories that happened during that time is a lot, but then, maybe I can follow up later if you have specific questions there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:13):
I would love to hear a war story. This is definitely as interesting as I was expecting it to be. Just what I'm hearing so far is just things that worked well for them to operate at this insane pace and scale is the entire leadership team meeting every single day, 11:00 PM your time. Hopefully, at better times for other folks around the world.

Mayur Kamat (00:10:31):
There's some people in Sydney, Australia, so it was 1:00 AM for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Good grief. This idea of a flat structure, yeah, it's interesting, because I imagine that's not necessarily great for other reasons and then this idea of being in the details. Let me ask about that, actually. What does that actually look like? I think a lot of people, a lot of leaders are like, "Oh, yeah. I'm in the details, we should be in the details." What does that actually look like in real life at Binance?

Mayur Kamat (00:10:55):
Let me give an example. One of the areas, when I joined, one of the biggest product problem we had was, crypto before was fairly unregulated, so you could just sign up with an email address or even just a wallet and start trading. There was almost zero friction. Then it suddenly became regulated, where you would almost have a full KYC flow like a bank. That just meant that the conversion rate dropped from, let's say, 100% to 2%. Now we had to solve this problem. This was the daily meeting level problem. It's okay if you're operating in one country. You can do it easily. If you're operating in 200 countries where there's not even a standard for what a document acceptance criteria might look like, now you have a significantly larger problem. You cannot say, "Let's work with the KYC vendor and do the onboarding."

(00:11:49):
We had to, literally have this, the top 50 countries, the top 10 document types, this spreadsheet of basically 500 cells, the conversion rate at each level. Then we are looking at, okay, a passport in Kazakhstan has very low level of conversion. What can we do about that? Do we need a new vendor? Do we need better imaging technology? Do we need a new SDK from a vendor? Then we go cell by cell based on, let's say if I was running a typical product team, I would say, okay, let's just look at maybe the top 90 percentile of our users, but this was Binance and then CZ is like, "No user left behind. Even that one user in Congo is important because this is financial inclusion for them." Then all of those 500 sales matter, no matter how low their impact to the conversion rate is.

(00:12:45):
That's a little bit of Binance flavor there. It's extreme customer focus and it doesn't really matter. Customers are not a number. It's a person at the end of the screen and we care about them, so you would need to know, you would get questions like, why is the driver's license acceptance rate in Kenya falling suddenly? When you have, and that's just one piece of the problem in a large product with 80 different products. You, of course, cannot do it for every single product, but the concept of, what is the most leveraged decision you could be working on right now? If it is for your growth, it's the onboarding, then you'd better know exact every single screen of the flow, why is there a drop-off and what are your teams doing for it? That level of detail, and you just do it on different products at different parts of your journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
I imagine there's people listening where they're like, there's the team responsible for the onboarding flow and the KYC flow of their product and it's so hard. They're like, oh, there's all these problems with our flow. Imagine that for 100 different versions of the flow across 100 different countries. Good God.

Mayur Kamat (00:14:01):
And documents. It gets very tricky. It gets very tricky, but we also had resources. At one point in time we said, we had a team of 20 people working on KYC and we said, "For the next three months, we want 500."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
Which has its own downsides, too.

Mayur Kamat (00:14:18):
Has its downside, but if you're running in this extreme mode and you're less, not as worried about just the team's stress and personal development aspects of it, you're just purely looking at the execution of the product, there's a surprising amount of power that comes with it. This was probably the second time in my career where I had that, wow, you can do this because in other companies it would take years to do it. The first one was, this is going back at Google. I remember I joined Google. It was my first day at onboarding and I was the product manager for Gmail for mobile, for sync. I was in my onboarding meeting when they pulled me out and said, "Hey, we have an issue. The service is down and Wall Street Journal is writing an article that Google, Microsoft, Apple not working together causing the service to go down, so we need you in this war room right now."

(00:15:17):
It was a bug in iOS 4. This is a long time ago, which caused every single user to pull their entire Gmail inbox, re-sync the whole inbox. A bug on the Apple side is going to take two, three weeks to fix, and it was causing 1000x load to our servers. I remember Connie Wurz, who was the Head of Infrastructure at Google, and he's like, "Sure." He flipped a button and there were 1000x servers that showed up for the next two weeks. I was like, "Wow, that is scale," right? This was my second time feeling that wow moment where like, oh, we just put 500 people in and solve the problem. It's less about having the 500 people and being able to maneuver them that quickly. I don't think I've been able to do that at any other company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:06):
To close the loop on some of these radical ways of working, this idea of 50 reports per person and this idea of caring about a person in Congo not being able to sign up, do you think that's a good idea? Do you take those in the way you work now or is it just, in this particular situation it's important? Other places, maybe not.

Mayur Kamat (00:16:26):
There are several preconditions. One is you're growing really fast. The growth for the employees comes just from seeing problems at scale that are growing every day that it needs less of a manager's attention to figure out what you need to grow. The best way to grow in general is that you work at a very fast-growing company. If that's true, two, your people are extremely well compensated, so they care about the KPIs more than they care about what's the next stage in my career and how do I get promoted? Our bonus structure went from 0% to 500%, so a lot of people didn't really care getting a 10%, 20% pay. They just want to do incredible work because they know they would be taken care of. Three, it's a mission driven company, still believe at the end of the day that you're doing this just beyond the KPI.

(00:17:24):
At Binance, there was a very strong belief that 80% of the world doesn't have access to financial tools. They don't even have an access to currency that they can trust. When we look at, live in Europe or in US and we think about crypto, it's largely about speculation or bitcoin. For most of the world, they just need access to a US dollar, stable coin and just knowing that my currency is not getting deinflated because of things beyond my control. Everyone having come from these, a lot of our employees were across all these countries, they had a very strong mission belief that what we are doing will truly empower billions of people. There's a power in that. A lot of people go through, "Hey, I'm going to move mountains because it's not just about the money, it's just not about my career. It's about doing something that will change the world."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):
Let's follow this thread on accelerating your career, and talk about where you're at today, N26. As you know, I've been doing a bunch of research on which companies hire and produce the best product managers. I've done a couple passes at this, and N26 has come up in the top five of both ways of approaching this, essentially which companies alumnis go on to do the best in their career. N26 is way up there. I want to come at this from a couple directions. One is what N26 as a company does to hire and incubate the best people, but also just you personally, what your advice is to people and how you help them become great PMs. Let's actually start in that second bucket. What is the most common and most impactful career advice that you share with product managers that you manage, that you find most helps them move ahead in their career and get unstuck in their career?

Mayur Kamat (00:19:12):
I think the number one thing I shared before, the best thing you can do is find companies that are growing fast because it compounds your learning at a much faster interval. Just the basic compound interest formula, even if your interest rate is low, if you're compounding daily versus compounding yearly, after two years, you will be at a whole different stage at the end point. Companies that are growing fast just lets you get that learning much, much quicker. I remember joining Microsoft first in my career. Some of the products I worked on during my internship had not shipped till I left Microsoft three, four years later. That's a very, very low rate of compounding. Microsoft's a whole different company now 20 years later, thankfully. Then you contrast that something like Binance where every day or every hour, every minute you're shipping something and then learning from it.

(00:20:04):
The faster you can compound your learning, the faster you will grow. The second piece generally is, you need to optimize for what you're great at. Now having two kids, I'm fairly in the fact that your strengths get defined very, very early, right? I'm looking at my nine-year-old and twelve-year-old, and they have a whole different set of strengths. If you're 25 years old early in your career, it's very hard at that point to say, "Oh, here are all my weaknesses and I need to improve on those." A lot of the career feedback typically tends to be around, "Hey, here are the things you need to be better at. Why don't you do more of that stuff, right?" Formally in the camp that you need to know what you're great at, what are your superpowers, and you need to find jobs where success is determined by how much of that superpowers you get to use.

(00:20:58):
Early in your career, you can't get away with the fact that there's some stuff you're not going to be great at and you just have to manage around it. If you get higher up in your career, then it gets easier because you can build a team that complements your strengths, but again, if you're early in your career, find places that, if you're a great creative person, if you can look at a product and think of 100 things you can do better, you are always about what's the next best thing and how quickly can I implement it, you need to be working in teams that have a high experimentation culture. You need to be working in growth teams in large companies. If you work in a FinTech company on a compliance side project or launching a new business vertical, you're going to struggle, right?

(00:21:46):
On the same time, if you have extreme management structured thinking, you have great stakeholder management, you have high EQ, you should work in teams where there is a large amount of complex people management and process management. You would struggle in a growth team where the expectation is you're doing things really quickly. I would look at first very introspectively, what are my true strengths? What do I, and then look at jobs where that has a much higher profile of winning. Thirdly, largely I would say do not optimize for compensation, especially early in your career. If you're truly on a track to become an executive someday or found your own company and make it successful, you will find that the compensation is so much backloaded that you would make 90% of your compensation in the last five years of your career, so optimizing for 10%, 20% early in your career.

(00:22:48):
If you have two jobs, I would rank in your first 15 years of your career, I would say do not look at the compensation. Then the last one, this was strange. I never thought about this longer, but now I think this is probably the most interesting advice I can give people is determine very early in your career if you truly want to be a C-level someday, you want to be an executive someday, because it's almost like if you're ambitious and successful, you enter product management. You are in top of your, it's almost an expectation of you that you would become that and you'd never really challenge or question yourself, is this the thing that needs me, that I need to do to get there? Is there something I'm going to truly enjoy? Not just the destination but the process to get there.

(00:23:38):
A lot of people think that and they make suboptimal decisions based on that. There's incredible careers you can build and incredible lives that you can live by just being great at what you do, doing more of that stuff. You end your career maybe as a director, maybe as a group product manager, but throughout the stuff, you have built a holistic life that doesn't revolve around your work and gives incredible meaning to you, or you can be saying, you know what? Work is a huge part of my identity. Somebody asks me what wakes me up in the morning and what gives me that energy? It's my work. I can't separate my identity from your work. Then maybe you should pursue that C-level path because it'll truly be fulfilling and you would be able to make those challenges and sacrifices that are going to be asked of you to make that.

(00:24:30):
If you can calibrate that early and have that true conversation with yourself like, "Yes, I want to go down that path and I want to do," you would make different career choices. In that path, I would definitely say don't look at compensation. There are two jobs. Look at the three things. Is it going to give me high compounding of learning? Is it high overlap with my strengths, and am I going to have a lot of fun doing it? If you have fun doing it, then it becomes a virtuous cycle and you do more of it and you're great at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):
On the question of decide if you want to be a CPO, essentially-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
Do you want... Decide if you want to be a CPO essentially, is the, the implication there is, if you do, that's a big sacrifice, you're going to be stressed. Work-life balance is worse. Is that kind of the core question?

Mayur Kamat (00:25:00):
No, no, no, absolutely not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
Okay.

Mayur Kamat (00:25:00):
Absolutely not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
Okay.

Mayur Kamat (00:25:16):
It's like, if you truly enjoy your work and what you're doing, it won't feel like a sacrifice. When you're constantly, when you look at a new product, you're walking down the street, you see a new product, you're on the app store, you see a new product, and you're like, "Oh, this is cool. Oh, look how they're doing the onboarding. Oh, look how the app store entry looks." If that truly fills you up, it fills your cup, every moment you're looking at why things can be better, how you can be better, how a certain thing... You would, the sacrifice will not feel like sacrifices. It'll not feel like you're working long hours. You'll not feel, hey, when you're talking to PMs and giving them some guidances, when you're building things, when you're recruiting new people, all that stuff, it fills your cup, it doesn't drain it. Then you would have incredible fun on the journey. So, it's less about that your sacrifices or work-life balance.

(00:26:10):
The moment you start having those conversations, you are probably not on that track. You should not be on that track because the moment the word work-life balance comes, I think Jeff Bezos has this thing that he hates the word because it means there are opposite things that need to be balanced, right? It needs to be work-life awesomeness or something like that, where every moment is awesome whether you're working or you're living. But for some people, that comes naturally because that's how they're wired. And those people should absolutely pursue it because it would be incredibly fulfilling, and the things that are challenging would also feel not as onerous. Whereas for everything else, it would feel like a sacrifice, could feel like something you need to balance. And then you would, again, even if you're great at it, you're not going to have fun doing it, and at some point you will not be great at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:01):
For folks that are PMs today, there's almost an implication their career is heading towards CPO eventually. That's kind of the ladder they're on. What are the, say, top three most common other options you've seen, other paths you've seen of folks that you manage, so that people can think about, "Okay, I don't need to maybe just keep climbing this ladder. There's these other directions I can go."

Mayur Kamat (00:27:23):
I mean the number one, and that's I think back to your original question on N26, if you work in incredibly high growth companies, especially FinTech where there's a higher, people end up being founders because it's probably a whole different kind of track we can go down on, the founding your own company is probably the most kind of obvious/exciting alternate path. The only thing I ask there is, again, the same question, what you're good at and what you love doing. The challenges with founding a company is a large portion of running a company has nothing to do with building a great product, especially as the company gets bigger. I've worked for founders now for 17 of my 20-year career, right. So, even at Google and stuff, Nikhil was my boss at Google, used to be a founder, and the CEOs now, the thing they tell me when they hire me is, "I wish I had your job," because that's what I used to do. That's what I have loved doing, and now I spend 90% of my time doing stuff that is not the stuff that I truly enjoy.

(00:28:37):
But folks enjoy building stuff as a PM, there's a lot of things you don't have control over, and you feel like, "Hey, that's stopping me from growing. That's what's topping me from truly enjoying." Founding is a great path. You have that control now, you own the decision-making. There's rarely times you can say, "Hey, this did not work because of that person." Right? If you're constantly hitting that, then founding is a great path for you because then you have the ball control for better or worse.

(00:29:08):
The other is just, I mean, it's less about being a CPO and just growing your breadth and your depth instead of just the ladder, right? So you are incredibly, either getting specialized in a specific domain where there is now enough value for you to separate yourself from the pack, whether it's, like in FinTech, now we have folks who are onboarding experts with KYC. We have people who are fraud experts, [inaudible 00:29:37] who have really great understanding of how card schemes work and how MasterCards work and where can we get the right incentives for the user. The folks who are experts on customer loyalty and retention. You build that domain expertise and then you realize that everyone needs that, right? And that could be an incredible way to specialize. So, you may lead growth at certain team even though you're not a CPO, right? So, that's kind of the second way of doing it.

(00:30:05):
And the third one, again, just not to knock it out, is you realize that work is not going to be my big part of my identity. My identity is, who am I as a parent? Who am I as a community member? Who am I as a son to my parents? Who am I as an artist or a contributor? And that's what my death is going to be, a well-rounded person. And a job is great, I'm great at it, but I'm going to do it as much as it's needed. And the value and meaning, the top part of the Maslow's pyramid comes from everything but work. And then< you just lead kind of a balanced life because then work is a certain portion of it and the rest kind of fills the picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:51):
So, just to summarize these four really good pieces of advice for how to essentially keep your career going and get unstuck and accelerated, is work at companies that are really high growth because your learnings will compound, and also the network you build, you didn't even mention that, that becomes really valuable because especially if the company does well, sometimes companies grow really well and there's extra benefits there, but even if they aren't, you still earn a lot.

Mayur Kamat (00:31:16):
Absolutely. Well, let's say N26, one of the reasons why they have so many founders is the fact that it was a category defining, like we were the first kind of mobile bank, right? So, a lot of the problems we saw in early days, nobody else saw them, right? So, every product manager had to solve it for the very first time in history. And that kind of is a whole different level of kind of trial by fire. Same thing with [inaudible 00:31:44]. They both started about the same time. Those are the companies that show up in the top rankings because you did this before anybody could do it, and you learn by literally moving mountains. I think two is also the fact that you see, we have this whole PayPal mafia. When you see this early success, everyone sees it together. So, when they go, they have that network, as you said, built-in.

(00:32:10):
These are, maybe it's a product manager who starts a company, but maybe there is a business development manager who has also started this company and now you can collaborate and have partnerships. So, that success, a mutual success, which a lot of early startup see, that creates kind of a more denser network than you working at a large company where not all of you see the success at the same time. And 3Ls comes down to the founders as well. They're incredibly mission-driven founders. I always find it super admiring now when I look back at Valentine and Max here at N26, or I look at CZ. They have reached from a whatever metric you can define of success, whether it's the size of the company, whether it's the personal network, beyond whatever anybody would think success means, right? And then, to wake up every day and to do this hours and hours single day, every single day, you are driven by a whole.

(00:33:14):
These are the voyagers of, these are the folks who would go explore new planets in the future or the folks who sailed out on the seas in 1600s to discover new land. That being access to these people directly is extremely, extremely empowering. You not just learn from it, but you get inspired by it. If you have an X definition of success, now your definition of success is 10x, you automatically push the boundaries more. So, I think those two things are, or those three things, early start, category defining companies, mutual success and creation of dense networks, and just being inspired by incredibly, incredibly successful and talented people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:59):
You pointed out this really interesting insight that I forgot to mention with the list of companies that seem to hire and create the strongest PMs. There's a lot of FinTech representation there, and I think you touched on why that might be the case because all these problems are extremely complicated and never been solved and they're solving at scale.

Mayur Kamat (00:34:17):
Here's the thing about FinTech, which is probably the most interesting is, FinTech, you have two customers. You have your usual customers and you have your regulator, and you need to keep both of them happy. And usually, what makes one happy, it makes the other one less happy, right? So, you are constantly dealing with trade-offs. In most PMs, in most companies you have some trade-offs, but they're not existential. Whereas in FinTech, every trade-off is existential. When you found a company, every trade-off is existential. You may not exist as a business if you make a wrong decision. In FinTech, a lot of the PMs see that day in day out, and that probably kind of conditions them to a whole different level of juggling balls than you would be a PM at other company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):
Yeah, that's such a good point. Just really good stakeholder management influence dealing with all these trade-offs. I think that's a really good point. I'm going to come back to the strength stuff because that's really important and I've been meaning to come back to it. So, just to reflect back, the four things you pointed out are really what you want to look for to accelerate your career. Companies that are growing really fast, working on things that you're good at, and finding a role that leverages your strengths versus things that you're not good at. Not optimizing for comp really is such a good point there. Your point essentially is you'll make most of your comp later, probably the 50%. The second half of your career, you probably make, I don't know, 10 times more than you make the first part of your career.

(00:35:37):
And so, optimize for the future cop, not today's comp. And then this idea of making sure, ask yourself, do you want to be CPO? Do you want to go down the C-suite route or do you want to maybe probably plan to start a company, something else? And that informs the role you're in. Coming back to the strength stuff, how do people figure out their strengths? Do you have any advice for someone sitting around, they're like, "What am I actually good at? I don't know."

Mayur Kamat (00:36:00):
So, there's several ways to do it. I remember I read this book, this was, I don't think it shaped my understanding of it because I was already operating in that mode, but it used to be called Now Discover Your Strengths. I think now it's called Strength Finder 2.0. It's still 20 years old now, but there's a lot more newer ways to do it. There are two things I have done and they're both kind of, I'm not sure how accessible they are, but I'll give you the examples. So, at a Agoda, we used to pay a psychologist $5,000 for every single PM we interview, right? So, after you finish your PM rounds, we would send you to this psych assessment. It would be a six-hour psych assessment and they would tell me what your strengths are, not just that it would be an IQ component.

(00:36:51):
So, we would know what percentile you are, and not just like an IQ score like Einstein or not, but IQ score across different, across pattern recognition or structured thinking, across numerical ability, verbal ability, right? So, a lot of people say they hire the smartest people. At Agoda, we literally hired the smartest people because we paid the psychologist a lot of money to tell whether they're smart or not. But other than that, they also give you your strengths and weaknesses. It used to be called, I know the company still around, it's called Q4, and it's called Q4 because they had this four quadrants on two axes, one is on dominance and one is on warmth, right? So, you want people who are high dominance, high warmth in the 4 quadrant, and that as you can realize, if you also want smart people, to find those who land in that quadrant is literally looking through a needle through a haystack.

(00:37:43):
But when I, I almost didn't do it. I was like, this is like I've been doing products for 15 years, this is insulting that I need to go do a six hour... The only reason I did it at that time was my son was four and a half years old and I was teaching him, because you're going to go to kindergarten, I was starting do some math with him, and then in six months he knew all the math that I knew. He was solving quadratic equations and stuff. And we thought, oh, we have a genius in the house. We got to get him tested. So, we were testing him, and that's the only reason I took this test because I thought it would be interesting to understand what this process looks like. But then when I got the results, I was like, it was so spot on.

(00:38:26):
It was incredibly spot on in saying areas where I would do well, areas where I would struggle and need help. So, that's one way to do it. It's super extreme. A little bit a year, two years ago, we had the [inaudible 00:38:40]. CZ is good friends with Ray Dalio. So, we had Ray Dalio come to our executive offsite, and he walked us through how he and his company does strengths assessment. So he has a, that one is lot more accessible. I think it costs like $50. You can go to, I think you search for Ray Dalio's strengths, there's a website that you can go and... The way it works, slightly differently for executives because you do it, so those are your components, tells you how good you think you are, and then it has your leadership team vote you on certain different aspects. So, there's a two layer assessment, how good you think you are and how good everybody else think you are.

(00:39:19):
And then, the overlap is where your true strengths are. And as a CEO, I can say, "Oh, Mayur is great at design. Everybody else knows that Mayur is great at design. We should give design problems to Mayur." Right? So, that's another way of kind of... So, there's a scientific way of doing this and it's gotten a lot better since I read that book long time ago. Again, if you're truly, truly curious, it doesn't take that long and now it's a lot more accessible. That's one way to do it. And it kind of separates in terms of execution, in terms of structured thinking, innovation and design, creativity, stakeholder management, EQ. You get a little bit of a more scientific picture on what your strengths are. But this is also a simpler way.

(00:40:06):
As a PM, you do pretty much a large portion. Everybody does the same few things, right? You think you're designing the roadmap, you are coming up with what you think is the product strategy. There's a lot of time around just managing engineers, making sure they do stuff. There's stakeholder management, marketing, compliance, whatever. There's launch and just tracking data analytics. So, this part is true for most PMs. Some jobs require more of one versus the other. And you just know when you do these things, which ones one you're truly great at and you have a lot of fun doing, right? Maybe you just don't like Jira and the ticket tracking and just following people on that, and that's the worst part of your job. Stay away from more structured complex stakeholder management jobs. Or you find that, hey, you do really well at that and somebody ask you, "Hey, what are the 15 things we're going to do next week to improve a conversion?"

(00:41:06):
That's where you kind of have a hard time, you just sit down, spend hours thinking about it, then maybe that's not your strength. And so over time, you kind of build this self calibration on areas that you have fun doing and areas where you don't have. And then, when you look at the next job, just try and gauge, are they hiring me because I did really well at some of the stuff that I didn't love doing? And if that's what they're hiring you for, probably you're not going to have a lot of fun or high acceleration if you go there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:41):
There's so much there. There's I think an important point that I'll add, and I'm curious if you agree. A lot of new people or new people in their career, like, "Oh, I just want to think about strategy. I'm going to think about the big picture. I don't want to just sit there and optimize the roadmap and be in Jira." But it's actually, that's your job when you're just starting out. You need to earn the right to contribute to the vision, to the strategy.

Mayur Kamat (00:42:04):
There's one of the, and as a pre-conversation we talk about contrary and view, product strategy by definition seems like a... This is going to be controversial.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):
Great.

Mayur Kamat (00:42:17):
Not really... Those two words feel very at odds with each other for me. A product, you have hypotheses and if you can test it, you don't need a strategy. Right? If I say, "Hey, if I build this and I know this will add this much users and this time with this conversion rate, this customer acquisition cost and this LTV," that's your hypothesis and you could test it in the market very quickly. And if it works, you have your strategy. Keep doing more of it. Strategy is always keep doing more of it or don't do it, right? That's all that is to strategy. The key part is just figuring out which one goes in which bucket. And if you're really executing fast enough in a kind of structured, experimentation-driven manner, your strategy becomes a largely solved problem. So, for most, and that's a challenge.

(00:43:14):
A lot of people think strategy is about looking at Porter's [inaudible 00:43:18] forces, a lot of slides, we're looking at some data and slicing it and saying, "We need to go here or there." All of it is largely in some sort of package intuition. And the challenge with that is, usually you go with the loudest voice in the room. And if you're a junior in your career, it's a very frustrating exercise because you think you know the strategy better. But it's all it is. It's a sense of package intuition, and then the guy with the loudest, biggest title or the loudest voice is going to go do it. It was very early in my career, Jonathan Rosenberg, he was the head of, he was the CPO at Google.

(00:43:59):
All the PMs reported to him. He was not called the CPO back then. And he had this one thing he would say all the time that, "Come to me with data. If you come to me with ideas, we'll go with mine." Right? That was the saying. You can come with any ideas, we're just going to do what I think, but unless you come with strong sense of proof to override me. So again, strategy is a little bit overrated for product. For market expansions, for investments, for licenses, compliance, there's several areas where it makes sense and it's kind of useful. But for most product managers, your strategy should be, how fast can I go from hypothesis to data, right? The faster you can go there, the easier your strategy gets.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:48):
That is certainly a hot take. So the idea here, I'm curious how you operationalize this with folks at N26. Is it just like, "I don't need to see a whole strategy for the year. Just give me, here's the plan, here's what we're going to test, here's our hypothesis?" Are you actually, what do you tell your PM team?

Mayur Kamat (00:45:05):
We use this tool. I'm going to give a shout-out to Statsig because they're awesome. Vijay used to run the experimentation at Facebook and has this tool. There's several of those. But if you're running proper experiments, I just look at the Statsig dashboards, right? And I'm looking at experiments, I'm looking at what metrics they're moving, I'm looking at the P-value, I'm looking at how quickly can they get to statistical significance. And I'm like, "Oh, this is working. Let's do more of these." Right? So, now there's some areas where you can't do it, like in compliance, in legal aspects, in Europe, especially pricing. In US, you can run pricing tests. In Europe, it's a little bit different. So, those areas, you would need to have a lot more kind of deeper thinking, understanding of your cohorts. You're coming up with more structured reason for why you should do it, but you can't really test and know within a couple of days or a couple of weeks at max whether this was a good idea or not.

(00:46:10):
Those, if there are either irreversible decisions or they're just extremely time-consuming to find out, then do some pre-work. We look at largely, find a lot of companies that really look at data without looking at cohorts that make completely bad decisions, right, because if you look at your dashboard as a mixture of users over 10 years, 20 years, even six months, and they all behave differently. If you look at a cohort level development of certain users, you generally end up making better decisions. But even over there, it's still lot more, there's a lot of noise between the moment you start tracking it than moment you start making decisions based on it. The world has changed in that meantime. By now, this was kind of a very foreign concept when I brought this in. I'm like, oh, the conversions down now, even though the product's done really well because Bitcoin has crashed, right?

(00:47:06):
Nobody wants to go sign up for an Exchange account. So, if you just measure pre and post, you would think that you have done something wrong in the product. If you measure it as an experiment, you would know that, yeah, between the variant and control, it's still doing great, even though overall conversion is down. So largely, the more you kind of, one of the first thing kind of doing when I take on a role, the company already doesn't have an experimentation culture. That's largely why they hire me in the first place, right?

(00:47:35):
So, for now, the first thing is to say, how can we bring it in? First, the kind of right culture, the right incentives and the right tools. And then, once it's set up, it gets a lot of fun. Get a lot of fun for the PMs because you have democratized performance for the product managers. And the second thing, which I tell my PMs now, which is truly kind of empowering if you think about it, the challenge with being a product manager is everybody thinks they can do their job, right? You go to... The CFO might have an idea, the head of kind of accounting has an idea. Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas, right?

(00:48:17):
So, at some point in time, you're like, what is my discipline? What is my science? Nobody goes to the accounting guy and says, "Hey, I have a great idea for how to cook our books." Nobody does that because there's a science behind it. There's a science for financial forecasting. Even in technology, a lot of the times people just don't go and say, "Hey, just dump this thing and let's use this code that the AI code generator has used." Right? There's a little bit of science there.

(00:48:43):
Whereas in product, you largely find that it's a combination of data and ideas and stuff, and anybody thinks they can... The moment you build experimentation, you'll now make it scientific, right? Now, somebody comes up with an idea, say, that's a bad idea. Here, this is why it's a bad idea, because we have done this experiment six times and it has failed across this user groups at this exact level of impact created. So, it kind of gives the PMs the kind of, hey, I'm not just a general purpose technician, I'm a specialist now. And it's extremely empowering once we can, it takes a long time to move the team in that direction. But once you get it there, the PMs just, it's a natural kind of dopamine hit every time you run an experiment and see more metrics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:33):
I'm a huge fan of experimentation. I think most guests on this podcast are on your side of the debate. I feel like we could do a whole podcast episode on just how to create a culture of experimentation, how to change culture. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co founder of Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:49:55):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:57):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:00):
... show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Speaker 1 (00:50:05):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:35):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Speaker 1 (00:50:43):
That is very much our experience, but before the company. And to some extent during it, but the idea is with automation with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company, so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:59):
We appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get a thousand dollars off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Speaker 1 (00:51:13):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:14):
I want to come back to the question of what N26 has done well to create and hire great PMs. So you've spent a bunch of time on here's career advice that I often give and what has helps people most in their career. Just to kind of close this thread, is there anything N26 did or is doing that either from the hiring perspective or from training? I know you haven't been there from the beginning, just like as a business, as a company that they've done really well that other companies may want to copy.

Mayur Kamat (00:51:44):
Some of it is just the hiring philosophy. One of the advantages you get for being a big fish in a small pond is you get to have your pick of the cream of the crop. So in Europe here where we don't have the same level of unicorn or decacorn density you have in the Bay Area being one of the first ones or the few ones, you do get a little bit of that branding working in your favor. So some portion of that is just the input. If you're taking really smart people, very chance at N26 they will stay smart. Two is again, the level of problems that they work on are harder. Just the print tech angle we mentioned and now with this whole experimentation driven kind of change that we made in the last year or so, there's also a new kind of tool kit that they get, especially if they're going for larger big growth company as the next step of the career.

(00:52:48):
All the people companies I talk to, the amount of companies that are truly world-class at experimentation is so low that if you work in one of these companies and you build this tool set, you can build a whole career on this. You can go to any other company and say, "This is what I'm going to bring to the table." Because there's no growth without, as I said, without compounding wins faster. Nothing compounds wins faster than experiments and there's no company out in the world that says we don't want to grow. So that is an incredible kind of brand that you can build alongside with it. Then the third piece is just the scale. One of the other interesting aspects of banking is what I call a hundred percent product. It's actually more than a hundred percent, they're more bank accounts than human beings because a lot of people have more than one bank account.

(00:53:38):
So you never run out of target addressable market. It's as big as it can get, which means that there's no upper bound on how much... Because at some point if you're, I don't know, building in kind of an AI code generator, your market is capped that maybe developers or people want to be developers. Or you're building, I don't know, AWS, it's a massive market, but it's still like all the company that need online hosting. They look at banking everybody needs and the fact that it's oldest or the second oldest, depending on how risky you are or not... Or profession known to man. It is a self-hedged product. When things get tough on one side of our business, the interest rates, let's say, go high, spending goes down, but we make money on deposits. When interest rates go down, spending increases, so we make more your money on interchange, [inaudible 00:54:36] investments. So it's a very self-hedged business that lets you go through the troughs and the peaks better than most companies.

(00:54:45):
And that understanding that how do you build naturally hedged products is probably another kind of reason why... It just influences how you make decisions and how do you kind of scale your core product portfolio. Just one example, for about a year and a half ago, we were largely year bank with a card and we were the first mobile bank and that was a big enough market. But in the last year or so, we have just fleshed out that product portfolio. We have a big lending portfolio now. We launched savings last year. We invested heavily in savings because the interest rates were high, was a super amazing tool to attract new users by offering high interest rates.

(00:55:28):
But as the interest rates are going down now, which is investing heavily in lending because now you can get loans for lower prices, which was super hard to get last year. So being able to build products that complement the macro also gives you that kind of additional balancing act that you don't get in typical single focus companies. So I think it's a combination of few of those things, being able to get great talent, being able to train them now more so especially around experimentation and just see how we can build a product portfolio that complements each other but also naturally hedges against each other, just gives you a better, well-balanced way to operate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
I think this explains something really interesting. As you were talking, I realized that a lot of these companies that produce the best PMs are to your point, non-US based, but incredibly successful in their location. And so it draws in the most talented people in that region. So I know Intercom I think technically is... So Intercom was number one on this list of companies that produce the best PMs. Intercom, Palantir, Revolut, and then N26, Chime, Stripe, Dropbox were kind of at the top. And four of those essentially, or three of those are non... Intercom I think was Ireland for a lot of their team is based in Ireland. Then Revolut is the UK and then you guys. So it's interesting, that explains some really interesting insights of just be the best, be the big fish in a small pond, draw in the best talent and then work on really hard problems and be really successful. There you go. There's a formula.

Mayur Kamat (00:57:03):
Yes, yes. It's very simple when you put it that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):
Oh, man. Okay. You interestingly have worked in a lot of different places. I want to spend a little time here. So you've worked in Europe, you've worked in Asia, you worked in the US obviously. For someone that is maybe thinking about moving out of the US or maybe moving to the US, what have you found are the big trade-offs?

Mayur Kamat (00:57:26):
Yeah, so I would say early career you want to be in intensely talents dense areas for all the reasons that we mentioned before. Finding the high growth companies, finding the networks that will make you successful. For general tech, there's no better place than West coast of the US. Everybody doesn't have the option, especially now with the immigration policies and so forth. I mean things were always hard. They seem extremely harder now. So you may not have that option, but if you do have that option, I would encourage everyone, there's no better place than West Coast to start your career. There's some exceptions, like for crypto, I would say Dubai is very strong, very great, has a really high density there. But again, it's a very industry specific. Bangalore, if you're Indian, has managed to recreate some of the magic of Silicon Valley, not at the same scale, but getting better. If you're in finance, maybe there is London, Singapore, and Asia has now at least not as much new innovation, but each of the big companies has a presence there.

(00:58:40):
So at least secondary talent densities there, those would be our options if US is not available early in your career. And in some ways it helps define you, right? If you work at Microsoft or Google or OpenAI or some of these companies that become brands later, it's something you can take with you when going... The second part of your question is if you decide to move, having that experience and that brand and that kind of achievements there can help you find great opportunities elsewhere. I mean, I've been a little bit privileged that some of these opportunities I found me like N26 here in Europe or Binance before in Asia where I wasn't really in that super talent dense area in the first place. But luck's not a great strategy. So if you're planning for it, I would say build your early career in the US. Honestly, when we moved to Thailand 2018, at that point, I didn't think I was making a great professional decision.

(00:59:51):
We were just struggling in the US with both me and my wife working. Both our kids in Seattle were tiny. My daughter had asthma at that time and she was just constantly sick. And it was a struggle for us to kind of manage both work and life. And when I talked to Agoda, I had never heard of the company and the only reason I ended up taking the job was like, hey, Bangkok's a hot place. My daughter might not have asthma there and we might have some help in the house. So we could probably balance some of the things that are really not adding value to our life right now. And that was the hypothesis there that I can do a lot more on work because I was literally not able to focus as much on it, everything else that was happening. And as I said, everything on an experimentation that we just hit a home run on all the hypothesis. My daughter, the heat cured her asthma.

(01:00:52):
Just having a support structure allowed us just as a family to spend a lot more time with each other and allowed me a lot more time to work and be on my career when I'm not doing dishes and not doing laundry and not throwing out the trash and not mowing the lawn. There's just so much hours that show up in the day that you could be doing things that you're great at and add to your career. And then Agoda just turned out to be almost like a bootcamp for understanding how an experimentation based product culture might work. Because before that I worked at Google, I worked at startups. My [inaudible 01:01:31] claim to fame was building big stuff and Agoda just taught me a lot of the growth comes with incredibly small things done faster. So it's part of Booking Holdings. So if you heard of Booking.com, it's a $170 billion company. And what's interesting is that 10 years ago it was a $10 billion company which sold flights, hotels, and cars. 10 years later it still sells flights, hotels, and cars, it's a $ 170 billion company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):
Oh, wow.

Mayur Kamat (01:02:02):
It's an incredible growth story. And that tells you you really don't need from a strategy perspective to do something completely different if you can truly compound your growth by optimizing every single thing really, really well. So there are the pros that come with, as I said, when you move, most of the time you're building products that are global, especially if you're based in the US. Very few times you're building product that just work in the US. Now, that's not true for a lot of the countries. Like in India, a lot of products are only designed for Indian market, a lot of products in China only designed for Chinese market, but from the US you're designing product for the world and a lot of the times you don't experience the same constraints or you don't empathize with the user at the same level because you just haven't lived that user's life.

(01:02:57):
So in terms of just being able to calibrate yourself on what a global product might look like, being able to live in different places and understanding some of these constraints first hand, definitely a pro. As I said, especially if you have built that early reputation, you get to work at some of the best companies when you go abroad. And so there's a hit to compensation, at least initially for sure. Nobody pays anywhere close, especially here in Europe. But as I said before, don't optimize for compensation early in your career or even middle part of your career. So if you follow that advice, it'll not matter because you will have kind of something unique to offer. Even if you come back to the US later having worked in different... Having understanding, especially if you're in FinTech where the actual laws are different in different countries and that one you truly do not appreciate working in the US. Even at Google and stuff, when we would launch products, I would be like, oh, the lawyers, they're just making life difficult.

(01:04:07):
But the many of now have a true appreciation of how different the world truly is. It just makes you a better stakeholder when you talk to the legal team, when you talk to compliance team, when you talk to marketing. So I think those are all the pros. The compensation could be the con. The other big con is that today, if you're in Silicon Valley, I spent 15 years in Seattle, I worked at four companies, I could change jobs and stay in Seattle because there's enough companies there. You're not going to run a ceiling at some point, in Bay Area, there's no ceiling, right? You can keep growing. The challenge now is that if I'm in Bangkok and I'm working at Agoda, at some point I need to find a new job or because let's say I'm at the CPO level, I want to be CEO now. Agoda already has a CEO, so I need to find, be a CEO somewhere else. Guess what? That company is not going to be in Bangkok. Now I have to move and move my whole family to Singapore, which I did. Then you hit somewhere over there or then you hit another ceiling, now you need to move back or go somewhere else with Thailand, which I did. And then you're like, oh, maybe there's a great opportunity in Europe which would give you a whole different scale. Then you need to move to Spain, which I did. So at some point your family's like, what's happening? It turned out to be what turned out to be one step to go from A to B is now just a every year journey.

(01:05:34):
So that's something to calibrate, especially later in your career that it's extremely hard if you like the job and don't like the location or vice versa, 'cause they usually come as a package deal now. We see this in Bangkok now where there's not that many great tech companies, and if you're at Agoda and you're doing really well, but it's just one company, you just don't have options. And especially if you love Bangkok, which is a great city, probably my vote for the best place to live in the world, that's a struggle. You love the city, but if you need to move your career ahead, you need to go somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:16):
So interesting. I feel like Thailand is very popular right now with White Lotus.I think White Lotus had the most views of any show or some crazy... It was very popular. I feel like there's a lot of tourism coming to Thailand more than they've had.

Mayur Kamat (01:06:31):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:32):
Yeah. I want to come back to one piece of advice that we were chatting about before we started recording that I think might be helpful to people, which is, and this is kind in a different direction, but I want to make sure we touch on it, is Shreyas Doshi's point about leverage. I know this is something that you think a lot about. He has this really good advice and we'll point to the episode if people want to dig deeper around finding the highest leverage opportunities for you to work on as a PM. Can you just share that advice for folks that haven't heard this before?

Mayur Kamat (01:07:00):
This is true for no matter what level of career you are in, but you have a finite amount of time and largely you have more problems than you have time to solve them. The question is which ones you work on. And this becomes even harder, let's say you're a CPO now because all of them are important, otherwise they will not come to you in the first place. The question is, which one do you work on? And the principle is simple. You work on problems that have a 10X positive or a negative impact. I mean the number can be 10, 5, 300, depending on finance it would be a hundred, some companies might be three. And in most FinTech companies one of two problems, it's a growth problem or a compliance problem because both of them can have a negative or positive 10X impact and that's what you focus on. That's what you spend bulk of your time. What was interesting for me, my first executive roles, that was Google, I was a product manager.

(01:08:01):
I joined what was White Pages back then as a VP of product. I was my first kind of... And White Pages, Alex Allgood, Seattle, founding legend, three companies, all unicorns now. Incredible, very good personal friend and mentor. What was truly interesting when I joined it, they're like, "Okay, this is your desk, this is the product area. So we had two offices, this is when everybody worked in office five days a week." And I'm like, "Okay, where does Alex sit?" And he's like, "Oh, he's sitting with accounting." And I'm like, I didn't think about it because I thought his office is near accounting. Then I find out he doesn't have office, he has a floating desk. So all the other desks were fixed, but he had a movable desk and he would move his desk to one of the departments, which I think had the highest leverage opportunity. And he would sit there at that desk when that department till that either problem was solved or the opportunity was realized, and then he would literally move his desk and then go to product or tech or finance.

(01:09:08):
And that was his way of... You could literally visualize him working on the highest leverage problem by his desk moving. And then that combines that with what we talked before about details and a little bit, I think I didn't mention it about the humility that you need to have to be working in the detail. A lot of the times, especially later in your career, you're like, hey, this is beyond me. This is below me. Why do I need to do that? I have so many PMs or data analysts or somebody should do it. Why would I do it? And that was kind of again, just a quick story there. I remember we were trying to figure out our growth channels and we found out that, hey, we are kind of really tapping out on paid, on social, on referrals, but SEO was something we just hadn't worked on for a while. We're building a caller ID app and what we wanted to do was when somebody types a phone number in Google, we want to be the first link to say, hey, is this a spam call or not?

(01:10:10):
Or whose number it is. And if we could then we could get them to download our app. That was the hypothesis. So I present at the executive team meeting to Alex, like, "Hey, I have a team. I want to hire a product manager focused purely on SEO and because I think that's one of our highest leverage areas right now." And Alex is like, "Hey, the whole White Pages, I built based on SEO. People who type people's name and the first thing used to be a White Pages link. I'm one of the best people in the world to work on SEO." I'm like, "Yeah. So?" He's like, "Let me run this product." I'm like, "Okay, what do you mean?" He's like, "No, no, I will be the product manager for this for however long you need it." I'm like, "How's [inaudible 01:10:54]?"

(01:10:54):
"They don't worry about it. Just tell me about the engineers." So again, he moved his desk to where that product team sat, and for the next three months he was the product manager on that scrum. So he would come to my product team meetings, give us update on what's happening with the SEO scrum, and then an hour later I would be in the leadership meeting giving my update to him, and truly he was operating it saying, this is high leverage area for the company, high leverage for my yards. It should be high leverage for me. I'm the best person to do it. I'm going to be in the details and do it. CZ, same at Binance, there were a lot of products that he would just sit on himself. There were very few people at Binance who would say no to CZ, but one of my lead PMs who worked on the products that CZ worked on, he would tell them no all the time.

(01:11:41):
They would just baffle all the other executives, how is he saying no to CZ and none of us are doing it? Hey, that was his product area that CZ was working on, and there was that mutual respect there that, hey, we know this thing and he is going to say no to me because probably not a good idea. So that humility and attention to detail is required to work on the high leverage problems. A lot of the high leverage problems are not, as I said, not strategy decisions. They're not language markets to go after and stuff. A lot of them are like, why is this thing not working as well as it needs to be? And a lot of time the devil is in the details and you need to be over there. I think combining that, knowing what is high leverage or not, and two, both having the humility and the patience to be able to go dig deeper and solve that.

(01:12:34):
Some of them are quick ones. Like if I'm looking today at, let's say how many of our signed up users convert into a long-term monthly daily active user, that could be something I focus on for a month. Because we're running a lot of experiments on early onboarding screens, early rewards, early incentives, early loyalty program, and at some point it might be like, oh, the team's got it. I've given all my... What I could do there. It's functioning. We have great PMs. I trust their execution on this. Let me just go focus on some of the compliance challenges that we have or fraud issues that we have in France.

(01:13:13):
Those kind of being able to kind of... The only way that works for me is I keep a very three calendar because you cannot do this without that. If you have hundreds of meetings, hundreds of one-on-ones daily standards, a lot of recurring meetings, you just can't find time to go work on high leverage problems. So that would be my kind of other stuff is you should have plenty of open spaces on your calendar. A full calendar is a badge of shame, not a badge of honor.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):
These are awesome stories. Just the metaphor of the moving desk is so good. That's the epitome of a... Like what you're describing is what people now call founder mode, where the founder just goes in the details working on the problem. Brian Chesky actually did this at Airbnb while I was there. He took on a new product and was like mini CEO, essentially. I don't know if he'd called himself the product manager 'cause I don't think he loved product managers. He kind of famously got rid of product managers, which he didn't actually... But yeah, he did that very much and he sat with the team, kind of created a whole space for the team that he was in. These are awesome stories and really good example of a founder using their power to unblock and finding the highest leverage opportunities.

(01:14:29):
To kind of start to close off our conversation, I'm going to take you to a couple recurring themes on this podcast, recurring segments on this podcast. First, we're going to visit AI Corner and in AI Corner I ask, what's a way that you have found to use AI in AI tool, a bunch of AI tools in your work to work more efficiently to work to create better quality work?

Mayur Kamat (01:14:55):
I still haven't found a game changer for me personally. Something that I use right now and I'm a little bit not-

Mayur Kamat (01:15:00):
He was like, now I am a little bit not sure that am I not doing something right, what the other people are, or I'm a little bit too jaded for it.

(01:15:10):
So we have Gemini across the work. So for meeting notes and stuff, works great, especially for folks who don't make it. We use a tool called Writer for our copywriting and UX teams, especially because we are operating in Europe across several languages. So being able to generate that very quickly, especially for illustrations and in-app messages and stuff that's been a, several tools now. But Writer just has, the copywriting market is really well done over there.

(01:15:43):
If you ask me across N26. But even when we did this at Binance or at Agoda, there are three areas where AI is complete game changer. One is on coding. Again, you can use whatever latest tool for prototyping or not most value, especially for the companies I have worked at, which are fairly large companies, very large code bases.

(01:16:09):
Having some sort of co-pilot that's integrated with your repositories. Rough data, maybe somewhere between 18 to 25% productivity boost for a developer, which is fairly massive, right? So that's one category, game changer. Customer support, game changer. Whether we should do it at scale or not, that's a different kind of more ethical/human question to ask there. But for solving the bottom 70 percentile problems, "Why is my card declined? Why is there a hold on my account? What happened to the replacement card I shipped? Why is it not arrived?" Basic questions, AI automating now almost 60, 70% of that. Customers getting that real feedback. Game changer.

(01:16:58):
And the last one is just on fraud and being able to just understand patterns better on real customers versus not. At Binance, we had this product where users could exchange crypto with each other. I could pay you Bitcoin and get Thai bath in return, huge amount of fraud.

(01:17:18):
And they're using AI just to understand language patterns of fraudsters versus not fraudsters. Massive. So again, as a company level, there is an incredible set of advancements across these three areas: developer productivity, customer support, and fraud. But for me personally, I'm like, what would I use that suddenly makes me a better CPO? I'm still struggling a little bit over there, but I don't think we need something at that level because largely what still remains the domain of humans is decision making and taking the brunt of the impact of what decisions you make because I would love to blame AI for some of my bad decisions. That's not why [inaudible 01:18:10].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):
You can still do that. You can still do that even if it's not.

Mayur Kamat (01:18:13):
Yes, yes. But again, hopeful to, generally not a big fan of ... The thing I call a little bit jaded. You have tools now that you write few things and they make a long essay for it. And then you have tools that compress long essays into few words. You could have just said few words in the first place and save the whole round trip. It's like a reverse zip. I remember when we had zip and it was a game changer, but there was a big file you needed to send over a slow network, so you compressed it and sent it and then expanded it. We're doing the reverse now. We have a small thing, we make it big and then send it over and somebody's making it small. But on these three areas, if you're at all skilled companies, if you don't have a great tool for developing productivity, you're not looking at essential basic LLM bots for deflecting customer service and you're not looking at patterns on user transactions or user communications or detect fraud, that's the first area I would focus on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:14):
Okay, I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast. It's called Fail Corner. And the idea here is folks like you come on this podcast, there's all these wins, killing it, CPO, this and that, and just moving into Thailand, it worked out incredibly, what a win all the time. In reality, that's not how things go. So the question to you here is just what's the story of a failure in your career when things didn't go well and it was a big deal for you, and then what you learned from that experience, how that actually impacted you?

Mayur Kamat (01:19:44):
Yeah, so from the product side, my probably most spectacular failure was I was the first PM on Hangouts. And if you ask Nikhil, he'll probably say he was my boss then. It was an effort the size I've never seen before or after in my career. We had thousands of people working for me. We had entire power of Google. We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do. And we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product.

(01:20:18):
So when I look at pure product-sense, product decision-making was, there's several reasons now I'd had luxury of 15 years to analyze that on solving for the wrong audience, solving for the wrong DNA of the company. I have this premise that certain companies can never succeed at certain type of products like Microsoft with mobile or Google with social or Facebook with enterprise, it is just the DNA of the founder actively acts against you succeeding there.

(01:20:54):
I would've said Google with enterprise as well. But then Sundar came and Larry was no longer the CEO and that's when the enterprise took off. They literally had to change the CEO to win in certain segments, but more, and then again, I worked in Nagoda during COVID, so travel company during COVID, Binance during its probably most tumultuous area of compliance and government scrutiny. There's a lot of missteps there around externalities. I think one of the main kind of learnings from that is just don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro. Things just move way more faster. And that's probably cemented my kind of now product philosophy of just doing small things very quickly, spending most of the times doing that. You still launch big products, but even over there we try and get early signals as soon as possible. But because in Nagoda, like one of the big projects we launched was we wanted to control the payments infrastructure for all the hotels and we thought if we had that device in the hotel's desk, so not only for bookings made online, but for everything that happens at the hotel, if we control that infrastructure, not only would we make money, but we had a touch point with the users that went beyond booking the travel.

(01:22:29):
Travel as you know, is not a high frequency activity. You book once, then you book six months later and most of the time people would not come to Nagoda, they would just go to Google and go to some other website. So we wanted that touch point that stayed with them and thought payments would be a great avenue to do that because that's something you do every day. And again, we did it in the Nagoda style.

(01:22:51):
So we did an experiment. We started very small and literally went to the mall and bought these $50 Android devices where we ran our software that people could just scan the credit card by a camera and charge it. It was incredible. We had thousands of hotels use it. And then COVID hits and then there's literally nobody going to hotels anymore. But it took us like six, nine months because of the licenses, and so to launch it. And in hindsight probably, I mean you couldn't have thought about COVID with that sense, but still the amount of time it took to launch the product was something we could have done better. So learnings for most of it is don't take too long to launch, don't take too long to validate your hypothesis.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:40):
The Hangout story is amazing. It's like a classic product. People now make fun of just Google, why can't you get this right? And it's been changed. Names have changed a hundred times. Interestingly, Meet ended up being really good, Google Meet.

Mayur Kamat (01:23:52):
That's the last thing I did when I left Google.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):
Oh, Okay.

Mayur Kamat (01:23:57):
After we built the Hangouts, they're like, "Okay, this is not going anywhere. We are going to start this new product called Allo." Which also didn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:05):
One of the many names,.

Mayur Kamat (01:24:08):
But then I said, you know what? We should still, because I used to work for Android Enterprise team before, I'm like, what if we just made it an enterprise product? Let me at least write the spec for it on, hey, what would we do differently for, I still called it Hangouts by Enterprise. They rebranded it later. But that was my salvaging moment for, but from the sense, I mean the Hangouts team invented WebRTC. Now every single communication in the world happens on WebRTC. So if you think from the cultural and technological impact that the Hangouts team had is insane. Like this tool we are using every single meeting product, every single WhatsApp, voice calling, video calling, every Zoom, everything runs on WebRTC. From a technology side, I think that was a pretty massive win that the team came up with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:04):
That's the power of having Chrome having a browser, also, just introducing technologies.

Mayur Kamat (01:25:09):
Yeah. Yes, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:12):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with or maybe a point you want to double down on just to kind of leave a little last little nugget before we get to the lightning round?

Mayur Kamat (01:25:24):
I mean, just summarize, it depends on the audience. A lot of the folks who probably listen to it or coming it from a perspective of like, "Hey, how does this help me be better at my job tomorrow than I was today?" And for them I would say, again, if you're truly working in areas where you think you're optimizing your strengths and having fun, just keep doing it and just keep that as your kind of north star, as you look at new pieces. When you talk to new companies, try and evaluate the overlap of superpowers. What is your superpower? What is the company's superpower? Will they feed each other?

(01:26:01):
If you get a very strong resonance there, I think that would be a great career step irrespective of whether it's in Bangkok or Spain or however the compensation is going to be, because truly you'll find that you grow much faster because it's a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy at that point. But just keep looking for overlapping superpowers all the time and not just in professional life, even the concepts beyond maybe even for relationships and stuff like folks who are extremely complementing strengths and whose superpowers feed each other make for great life partners. So there's maybe that analogy can be extended beyond your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):
Wow, that's a powerful point right there. Well, what a cool way to end that. Well, with that Mayur, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Mayur Kamat (01:27:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:02):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Mayur Kamat (01:27:06):
The one that I read most recently, so I generally don't read a lot of books because I read a lot of content like, small content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:13):
Tweets.

Mayur Kamat (01:27:14):
And tweets and then Substacks and Discords and WhatsApp messages, and so book takes a mind share shift for me to go read a book. The one I read most recently, which I thought was pretty amazing and a lot of overlap with what I said today, The Five Kinds Of Wealth. That one was very well articulated, especially the last point I made very early. One of the potential paths is you just do well on your job and then you find meaning elsewhere. This book is probably an incredible structured way of thinking around it. What is your wealth in terms of your health, your physical health, your mental health, your relationship health, your community and your wealth that you're generating financial wealth is and how do you think holistically? Because at the end of the day, you are what you optimize for. If you optimize for financial wealth, you'll become wealthy, but you might not be wealthy in a full spectrum manner.

(01:28:16):
The Strengths Finder 2.0, I said very early on. It's still an interesting book to just think about how you would think about your strengths, but again, if you don't want to read the book, I would just do one of these kind of online quizzes for it. But The Five Kinds of Wealth then Strength Finder 2.0 would be maybe what I would suggest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:35):
The first book by Sahil Bloom friend of the podcast willing to tell this stuff. I forgot to mention the story briefly about the Strength Finder stuff. So I actually, when I was leaving Airbnb and looking for my next thing and even thinking about leaving, I took a strengths test and I was working with executive coach and I saw the results and she's like, "What do you see in these results? What are these results telling you?" I'm like, I don't know. She's like, this tells me you should start your own company and work on your own. All the strengths that are popping up here are things that you as a founder need and that really helped me.

Mayur Kamat (01:29:07):
What's your one person data point on that? Was it a good one?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):
Was it is a good decision, you mean?

Mayur Kamat (01:29:13):
Yes, relying on that strength test to make a career.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:17):
The best. So great. I am such a huge fan of Strengths Finder and any kind of strengths test and interestingly, people may be afraid of taking them because they'd be like, here's what I suck at. It always makes you feel good. It's like, here's the stuff you're good at and it's not like, here's what you're bad at. It's just, here's the stuff you're best at and it's always positive. It's never like you suck at this stuff. It's just not your strength. So it was a huge win for me. I highly recommend it.

Mayur Kamat (01:29:40):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):
Especially if you're trying to make a career move. So yeah, fully aligned. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Mayur Kamat (01:29:48):
The one I saw that kind of TV shows usually I watch to kind of give it down time, so usually I watch just periodic shows, the House or Big Bang Theory and stuff. The one that I saw recently that kind of shook me a little bit was Adolescence. Again, it's a tough topic around teenage mental health and violence in schools and just the way it was shot. I would see the first episode, even if it's not your genre because it's shot in a single camera motion and the whole episode for an hour, there's no cut. Camera just keeps moving and it just makes bizarre, you feel a little different than watching it. Irrespective of this topic, which is also pretty intense. Just visually you feel different, and if you're motion sick like me, you really feel different.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:41):
That's wonderful. It sounds like what a ...

Mayur Kamat (01:30:45):
I would watch that. I need to watch The White Lotus because everybody keeps bringing it every time I tell them I'm from Thailand and I haven't seen it yet, so I'm behind on my mean culture a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:58):
Yeah, you are. It's like you, no one else has not seen it. I think you're the only person left.

Mayur Kamat (01:31:01):
Yes, I'm the only one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:04):
Okay. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Mayur Kamat (01:31:08):
So products, so I spend most of my time using banking and trading products, and I would give a plug here. If you're in Europe, try N26 or even revenue, incredible product. If you're in the US, Robin Hood, just the motion design they have done and the onboarding is just a joy to use, whether you use it for banking or trading or just for their card. I just find the product design and motion, especially as you touch and swipe and try to be done. Anything that Nikita Beard launches. So I just downloaded Bible study or Bible chat yesterday.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:46):
I saw a tweet about that. It's like in the top 10 of all social apps and it's like bible study.

Mayur Kamat (01:31:52):
Yeah, it's top ten. And I can tell why I have got three messages right now to treat my anxiety by reading Bible today, and one of the time I was feeling slightly anxious, so maybe there's some magic there.

(01:32:03):
But the one app that I would just for personal, I used to write in Hindi. I used to write poems growing up as a kid, and that was just now this app Suno.com. I can make songs from them and they're incredible songs, at least I think so. Nobody else thinks it so far, but just the fact that you can write something and now you have a song is just magical. The first time that AI, I saw a use case, I said, it's nothing so far that makes me a better CPO right now, but as an artist or at least the bathroom artist, it's just incredible that you can think of something, put it down there and you can actually see what would a professional singer and a band and a musician if they were to compose it, what it would look like. So that's probably the most wild I have been by technology, the recent times, the Suno.com. They're onboarding flow sucks and their growth product is, if I were the PM on Suno, I would do things a lot differently, but their core tech is magical.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:15):
I'm a huge fan. One of my favorite things to do at Suno, I think it's Suno.ai also, is just ask it to make a song in the style of a sea shanty. It's so fun. And they give you a few options, so you could be like, here's this version, that version.

Mayur Kamat (01:33:28):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:29):
Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Mayur Kamat (01:33:35):
One, I kind of relates to the things we talked about is there's no right or wrong decision. There's just low and fast decisions. Now, there are some extreme caveats to that around you're doing something that might kill your user like healthcare or military or even compliance, which can kill your company. Don't use it. But everywhere else in generally goes back to the strategy thing we talked about as well. A lot of the times if it's you make a wrong decision, if you make it fast enough, you would know it was wrong and you would correct it and you would still do it faster than thinking months for the right decision. So for anything that's reversible, anything that's not going to get you in jail or kill your company, no right or wrong decisions, just slow or fast decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:19):
Final question. You've lived in a bunch of places. You've lived in Spain, Thailand, Mumbai, Seattle, I think Texas, even for some period for school?

Mayur Kamat (01:34:29):
Yeah. College, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:30):
Okay. There's probably other places. Which has the best food?

Mayur Kamat (01:34:34):
Bangkok, no question. Barcelona comes closer for some, but Bangkok, you can have a three Michelin star, one of the top five restaurants in the world, spend $500 a meal or you can have a $1 street food, stir-fried pork and rice with basil. Incredible. Just the spectrum of entire, from the cheapest food you can think of, the most expensive food you can think of in that same one kilometer walkable area, having thousands of these, literally there's the density of food. No one comes closer. Barcelona has incredible restaurant. The best restaurant in the world is like a block away from here. It's called Disputar. Takes like two years to get on the wait list there, but that's on one end of the spectrum, Barcelona, that probably comes close second. But that cheap, get down 2:00 A.M. walk down and have an incredible meal for a dollar. nothing comes closer to it than Bangkok.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
This episode's a great ad for Thailand. Let's go. You definitely got to watch White Lotus. Mayur, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. I feel like I got to know you so well. We covered so many-

Mayur Kamat (01:35:50):
Thank you so much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):
... perspectives in all this. Yeah, we're not done yet. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe check out if there's roles at N26 and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Mayur Kamat (01:36:02):
Find me, this is one of the things being old is I was one of the first users of LinkedIn, so linkedin.com/mayur. [inaudible 01:36:10] Facebook, so facebook.com/kamat or N26.com. mk@N26.com. If you're especially curious about how we do stuff here, we are hiring, we are growing really fast. As I said, banking's a great business to be in. We're not going to go out of flavor for the next few thousand years. So if you're thinking of a career, you're thinking about Spain or was thinking about Berlin, just a whole different interesting lifestyle and different kind of product thinking, please reach out on any of those channels.

(01:36:46):
If you're in Europe, download or try N26. Like we go by the motto, love your bank. Our founders say that people would rather go to a dentist than to a bank branch, and that's why we build this. We truly feel like for an everyday banking, it's just use the app and you feel like, I want to use my banking app every day. There's some bit of magic, which I didn't have that much contribution yet. I made it a little bit simple and seamless, but magic was there before and so if you're in Europe, you're looking for a new bank account, N26.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:22):
There we go. Mayur, thank you so much for being here.

Mayur Kamat (01:37:26):
Thank you. Thank you, Lenny, and thank you everyone.

# Lessons from Atlassian | Megan Cook (Head of Product, Jira)

## Transcript

Megan Cook (00:00:00):
What we put into place is something we call Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about Fight Club. But it's 30 minutes every week, and it's just for myself, my engineering, and my design leader; and we get together, and we know that we're going there to have a conflict.

(00:00:18):
I think often when there's difficult conversations, or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific slot of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement. And it makes it much better. I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Today, my guest is Megan Cook. Megan is head of product for Jira, which is used by 75% of Fortune 500 companies, 125,000 customers globally, and is by far the most popular project management tool in the world.

(00:03:53):
Megan, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Megan Cook (00:03:57):
Thanks so much, Lenny. I am a big fan of your podcast, and I am excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:02):
I have a lot of things I want to chat about. I've heard about many things that you're extremely good at as a leader, as a product leader, and so I'm just going to poke around a bunch of different areas. I wanted to start with something that I hear you're just a big advocate of and really good at, which is creating space for play on teams and also just creating a lot of psychological safety, something that you find really important that helps your teams be as successful as they are.

(00:04:29):
Can you just talk about why this is important to you, why creating play and psychological safety are so important to you, and then just how you do this, maybe an example or two of how you actually apply this on your teams?

Megan Cook (00:04:40):
Yeah, absolutely. I think especially recently in the tech industry, it almost feels like we're going through a bit of a wake-up call at the moment. We were in this time of plenty, and everyone was hiring like crazy, and then COVID hit and suddenly people's behaviors had to really change. People couldn't travel; they had to work from home. There's a whole bunch of industries that got highly impacted by that, and it created this time of high ambiguity.

(00:05:08):
Before that, or to the start of that, I was noticing within my team just some little indicators where people weren't all comfortable to speak up when we'd had really open discussions with the most junior person, where the most senior person were happy to talk about anything. There was more anonymity in feedback. Every time things were coming to leadership to give feedback on, it was just sort of painfully polished. And I think once it gets to that level, that's a really bad time to give feedback, because it probably means that a whole ton of work has gone into it, and you might waste a whole bunch of work if you have to correct direction or make significant changes.

(00:05:53):
And so, I was looking at my team and thinking, "Yeah, something doesn't feel quite right here." And then I went to this leadership outside, and one of the speakers there was Ben Crowe. He's an expert in having the right mindset. So he works with Olympic gold medalists, and Ash Barty is another one, who's a tennis player. She's the number one tennis player in the entire world. So these athletes who have to really perform under a lot of pressure, in front of a lot of people. And he talked about how to be in that state of flow, where everything is going really well and new ideas are coming and you're making progress, you've got great momentum. And he talked about how to be in that flow state. There needs to be this sense of play and that things are fun. Your mind's open to new ideas, you feel really present. You're not stressing out and thinking about a ton of other different things.

(00:06:52):
And it's funny because when I thought about play where my mind went to the opposite of play is work. We often hear work and play as opposites together, but his point was actually that the opposite of play is fear. And I realized I think that's what I was seeing a lot of in my team and that's why the ideas were getting more incremental. So took that decision and went, okay, we need to look at psychological safety in that team or we're never going to get to some of these bigger, bolder, more innovative ideas. And so brought my group, product managers together, and we sat around and discussed it and all together came up with some ideas that we've implemented since then, which has had a really good impact. So I'll give you a couple.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Yeah, please.

Megan Cook (00:07:40):
One of the first ones was my team of PMs is big enough now where not everyone necessarily gets to know everyone else, and when you don't have that relationship, it can feel a little scary. You don't have that trust that you understand how people are going to respond to you and you're not sure about reaching out. So we divided the team into these smaller groups for peer feedback groups and the idea is that they meet every two weeks or so, somebody brings something that's in a pretty rough draft that they want to get reviewed and then everyone's expected to give feedback. And because we've got people in there who are different leadership levels, it's a really good opportunity to model the kind of feedback that's helpful and the culture there is one of everyone lifting that person up to make their work stronger.

(00:08:28):
So people can get in there, they can show that you can show work that's really in the early stages and feel comfortable with that. They can see that getting feedback can actually be really positive and they can see how all of these people together, they can rely on them and forge those relationships so they can rely on more people to help them out.

Lenny (00:08:47):
This is so interesting and it's such a good idea and it's such a simple and good idea and I'm surprised I haven't heard of people doing this before. Basically you pair up PMs, IC PMs and maybe managers too, to give each other feedback. And is the feedback on one-pagers and PRDs and strategy docs and things like that? What sort of documents are they giving feedback on?

Megan Cook (00:09:11):
So really, it can be anything. It can be here's a new experience, [inaudible 00:09:15] launching, here's a new strategy. I've taken my own strategies in there and gotten excellent feedback, surprising feedback from the team. Can be a new experiment that people think of running and anything to do with the craft.

Lenny (00:09:29):
And I think as you kind of implied, one of the powers of this approach is it's a small team, so it's less stressful and there's no... You're not in the room often too. I guess you are sometimes as you just said, but usually it's like peers and they could be a little more open and less worried about looking back.

Megan Cook (00:09:46):
Yeah, absolutely. And I think a lot of it is just building that muscle. You might go through an experience once every quarter or once every six months and that can feel really stressful, but if you're doing it again and again, you get used to it. You get used to what to expect, you get a bit more practice, it can feel much more comfortable.

Lenny (00:10:04):
That's awesome. So it's just simple and powerful idea. It's kind of like everyone's always suggesting getting a mentor, getting a coach as a PM and those are hard to find. And this is just a little informal. It's almost like a little peer group board of directors for your work. We talk about that on the podcast sometimes. So anyway, that's awesome. Really good idea and something anyone can do.

Megan Cook (00:10:24):
Yeah, thank you.

Lenny (00:10:26):
Great. Okay, you have a second idea?

Megan Cook (00:10:29):
Yeah. One of the other things we do is we get everyone together just like every six months. So all of the product managers get together in the same place and the idea is to have a bit of an onsite. Now we start off with just doing something fun because everybody... As you might know, Atlassian is a remote organization, so everybody works remote all the time. They can work from anywhere. And so people often, they're not used to necessarily being all together in the same place. It can take a little while to warm up. And then after that we talk about strategy. We do workshops on different elements of craft boosting that craft together. And so a similar kind of thing. People get to build relationships together. They get to see all these different ideas bouncing around which can help uplift their own ideas and help them be more innovative.

(00:11:23):
In this last one, I actually had some senior leaders from all over the organization come and share their stories of failure. So just to get everyone used to that idea that it's okay to fail and actually if the learnings are really good, maybe it should even be celebrated and it's not something to be scared of. And taking the big swing isn't a bad thing. It can be a really powerful way to learn as well.

Lenny (00:11:50):
I love that. We've been talking about failure a lot on this podcast, so we're super aligned with the power of that. And so just to be clear, so what you do there, is it the entire product team of Atlassian or is it just your team in this every six month?

Megan Cook (00:12:04):
It's just my team and then we pull in other product managers that we work closely with as well.

Lenny (00:12:09):
And then you fly them all to Australia, I imagine?

Megan Cook (00:12:13):
Yeah, all to Sydney

Lenny (00:12:15):
To Sydney. Amazing. Okay. And I think, so the key there is it's not just like go meet each other, it's training almost on different skill sets, helping people level up in say craft or I don't know, communication or writing or something like that. And then who teaches these things? Is it like individual team members or you bring someone in?

Megan Cook (00:12:36):
We have a real mix actually. So yeah, we'll bring in outside experts or we'll get... There's a lot of knowledge and a lot of skill within the team itself. So you'll have different product managers who have different strengths. We have totally different teams. So someone on a growth team, for example, might want to teach everyone about how to create great hypotheses or we'll get someone external from the team, but internal to Atlassian who has those skills who can come in.

Lenny (00:13:04):
I love that also gives those PMs a chance to, one, learn the skill better themselves because they're teaching it, and also just teach and present in public speaking and all that stuff. There's all these other benefits to doing that sort of thing.

Megan Cook (00:13:16):
Yeah, absolutely. And I think as a product leader, it's really important to model the behavior you want to see from your teams, whether that's getting out there teaching, presenting, explaining different concepts, explaining the business or just being vulnerable and talking about when things haven't worked out.

Lenny (00:13:34):
When we started this question, you talked about how there was kind of the shift at Atlassian where things started to feel more formal and people started to feel less open to sharing, being criticized in meetings. Just in case people might feel that might be happening in their company, do you remember roughly what size that started to happen at or signs of like, "I'm noticing people are sharing less or being more worried about talking in big meetings"?

Megan Cook (00:14:00):
Probably when we got into really different streams of work that were happening where people didn't have as much of a reason to interact with each other. So I think that was probably around, even around 15 we started to see a little bit of that.

Lenny (00:14:19):
15 product managers?

Megan Cook (00:14:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:21):
Got it. Cool. That's a good stat.

Megan Cook (00:14:24):
Yeah, you know what, I'll give one more thing that we do. So we've just started trying something new called the $10 game for priorities. And so that's where I think people might have played the $10 game for your priorities when it comes to a strategy or something like that. We started trying it out with your individual priorities. So you and your manager might come in and you can list out all of your priorities and then show you through just dividing up $10 where you're spending all of your time. And I've done this with people and we've sort of gotten down to like, "I'm putting 10 cents here this week." And I'm like, "Oh, what is that? 20 minutes, 30 minutes spending. I didn't think that's actually moving right." And so it's been great to see where people are overloaded and alignment on do my priorities stack up, but also am I spending the time on the most important things that could be moving the business forward?

Lenny (00:15:24):
Awesome. Okay. So you mentioned that y'all are remote. Has it been remote from the beginning?

Megan Cook (00:15:31):
No, not from the beginning. Actually when COVID hit, I think that was the big one.

Lenny (00:15:35):
Okay, okay, got it. That makes sense. So a lot of companies are moving to remote work, trying to figure out how to work remotely. It seems like it's working really well for Atlassian, at least from what I can see. Is there any advice or any big lessons or tips or tricks you've learned that you could share for how to be effective working remotely, especially as a product manager? It feels like as a PM, the job has gotten so much harder having to be remote, and so yeah, I'm curious if you just have any advice you could share for people trying to make this work for their company or for themselves?

Megan Cook (00:16:04):
Yeah, absolutely. It's a really good question because it's not easy and we definitely went through a whole bunch of pitfalls at the beginning, but we're really firm believers that you don't need to be in the office to build world-class products. So we call our product team anywhere, and this means that anyone Atlassian can choose where they want to work every day. We think it's a bit more human, that flexibility shouldn't be a perk, that it fundamentally can change people's lives depending on what else they have on outside of work. And so we think less about where do you work and we think more about how to be productive and effective in your work.

(00:16:44):
To your point, we started doing this right when COVID hit, so it's been about three years and actually we just released a guide with our key learnings from that. It's all about a thousand days of remote work, which folks can go and find on our Work Life blog under research@atlassian.com if they want to dive in there more. But I can give you a couple of tips from that and what we found from some of our research.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Yeah. And we'll link to that doc in the show notes.

Megan Cook (00:17:12):
Okay, great. The first one is just making time for connection. So that human connection is definitely built in person, but what we found is that it doesn't have to be something that happens every single day. So we found the connection and productivity, they both get boosted by about 30% when you bring people together but intentionally, and it lasts them months. So we found that you can do it on average like three times a year. And so that's why my PM team are getting together every six months. But in addition to that, we get the entire team together every other six months. So we end up all getting together every four times a year.

(00:17:53):
So every other six months, what we do is we get all of the engineers, designers, everybody who's working together. We book out entire floors in the office and then for an entire week we're just there. And for some of it we're just working together as you normally would, but at desks and just having those little water cooler type conversations. It builds the relationships again. Other times we're doing workshops, an important piece of work where it's easier to do when you're all in person and sometimes we're just having fun together. We call that a bit of a festival.

Lenny (00:18:27):
You mentioned that you measured some kind of productivity improvement. Do you happen to know how they measure that because that is really interesting?

Megan Cook (00:18:35):
Oh, that's a good question. I don't, but I can get that for you.

Lenny (00:18:40):
That'd be cool to know. So I think we'll keep this in the podcast episode and then if there's anything in the show notes that we link to that talks about how they measure that, that'd be really interesting because that's just a cool stat to have anyway, for all kinds of other things. I'm curious how they measure that.

Megan Cook (00:18:54):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny (00:18:56):
Okay, cool. Any other tips?

Megan Cook (00:18:58):
I think the second one is to be really intentional. I mentioned that we went through a few stumbling blocks at the start. One of those was immediately, everyone sort of filled up everybody's calendar with all of these meetings straight away. It was almost as if Lenny, if you and I were working together, I used to be able to just poke my head around my monitor and ask you something. And people were afraid that now that I can't do that, how do I get those answers? So I need more time with everybody and that definitely does not help productivity at all.

(00:19:33):
And so as PMs, we need time for creative work. We need that deep work time, and that doesn't happen when you've got all of these meetings with 30 minutes in between each of them. You need three to four hours to get that going, to get into that flow state. So my leadership team and I, we actually sync up our calendars, so we end up having these long stretches twice a week all at the same time. And so we all get a chance to do this deep work. It means we get less time for meetings, but it also means that if something comes up that's unexpected that we all need to work on together, then we've got that time there so we can be a bit more relaxed about it. We know we can get to it.

Lenny (00:20:14):
What time of the day is that meeting?

Megan Cook (00:20:16):
They're both at different times. So the first one's taking up one afternoon and the second one's taking up all of the time in the morning. Depending on what kind of person you are, one is going to see you better than the others. So we just went for one each.

Lenny (00:20:28):
I actually had the same thing just personally where I had these deep worked blocked times on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The title of the invite was, "If you book time during this, I'll slap you." And it really worked well. But I think you're talking about this other missing piece of remote work for PMs where you can't just walk by and ask an engineer, "Hey, how's it going?" Or ask a designer, "Oh, where are you at? Let me just take a peek at what you're working on." That stuff I think is really hard to replicate. And if your suggestion is block out this time for your leadership team to be able to check in with each other, is the idea there it's deep work time and don't bother anyone on the team or is it you can also just ping your end manager and like, "Hey, how's it going?"

Megan Cook (00:21:09):
The idea is that it's deep work time and it's your time to be protected to do that work. What I found that works really well, I think in the manager and report kind of relationship, so I have these really quick punchy one-on-ones with my reports every week. And then I make sure that I've got space in my calendar because something will come up where even if we had a longer one-on-one that might not cover it. They might just need an hour to run through something, there might be a really difficult strategy problem they've run into. And so they'll know that they can ping me for more time and I'll have that flex in my calendar for that.

Lenny (00:21:49):
Awesome. Any other tips along those lines?

Megan Cook (00:21:52):
Well, you probably noticed about blocking a bunch of deep work time is that you don't have as much time for meetings. So that meeting time becomes really precious. And what we do there is... I personally hate having status updates as a meeting. So I make it really clear that if we're having a meeting, this is to solve a problem. And if it's just a status update, that's fine, then I can read that asynchronously at a time that works for me. And so can everybody else in the team if they want to do that. Actually we use our own tool for this, which makes it really easy. So it's called Atlas and it lets you or the team put in status updates for a goal or a project regularly and then it'll bundle it all up into an email so you can quickly get across everything that you're interested in, which has been really helpful.

(00:22:40):
And then that just makes the documentation rigorous as well. So you document things and we use Confluence, but all of our decisions, strategies, kickoffs for projects, that's all really well documented piny starters. Or even if you're a year down the line and you're thinking, "Why didn't we come to that decision in the first place? What were our assumptions? What were our hypotheses?" It's easy to go back and take a look at that and be able to reflect.

(00:23:11):
I think the last thing is I work with people who are in the US, they're in Europe, they're all over the world. It's really hard to find a time that works for an Aussie, an American and a European to get together. Someone's waking up at 3:00 AM or something. So what's become a big part of how we work is actually audio and video recordings. I actually had someone reporting to me for a while who was in France and what we would do was record videos back and forth and they're quick. You can just use colloquial language, they're really casual, you don't have to wonder about someone's tone that comes across. So that's becoming almost like a completely new document type for us and it's been really important in remote work. You can put at the top of a document and explain the document, which is really nice. It's a big part of why we bought Loom.

Lenny (00:24:06):
I was just going to say that. It all makes sense.

Megan Cook (00:24:09):
Yeah, because it was just becoming such a big part of our life and it's just massively helpful.

Lenny (00:24:16):
Kind of along the same lines, being fully remote, it is harder to get buy-in on things you're working on I imagine. And something I hear you're great at is getting buy-in, especially getting buy-in on ideas and projects from executives. So I think things that make it extra challenging at Atlassian, there's two CEOs which I didn't know until recently. You're also all very remote and so maybe those two reasons make it extra hard. Plus it's just generally hard to get buy-in on projects that you're working on. What advice do you share with product leaders, PMs that come to you asking for advice on how to get better at getting buy-in for your ideas?

Megan Cook (00:24:56):
Yeah, this can be really hard to get right. I watch a lot of people struggle with this, and you're right, being fully remote can make it a bit more challenging. And then I think also you've got your cross-functional partners that you're working with as this tight-knit team and how do you form that relationship? But I'll start with just general buy-in.

(00:25:17):
Most of the time when people come to me and they want to ask how to get by-in, they've got a date in mind, they've got a particular meeting and they have this idea where they're going to crop this perfect proposal, they're going to present it, everyone's going to give them thumbs up and they win. And that's the wrong attitude I think even to start with to getting buy-in. It's more of a journey.

(00:25:40):
I'll give you an example where I was looking at how do people start their day in Jira and how do people get started in Jira? And we had this idea of we could craft more templates so that we could give people a better way to start with very different use cases when they came into the product. And this could change everything from even just the front homepage where they started all the way to what's happening in product. It would create this really nice flow.

(00:26:12):
Jira is also a platform as well as just Jira software the product. There's actually four different products built on top of it. So when you want to go and change something like that, you're actually changing it for all of these different products. It's not just the one. And so what was really important there was partnering with a whole bunch of different stakeholders. So every product that this could potentially negatively or positively impact, we went to very early with the idea and the proposal and we got their feedback and then we came to them and again and again as we developed it further. So as we got designs, as we got more data, as we tested things out with users, we kept coming back and we take their feedback on board.

(00:26:54):
And so I think creating those partnerships is really important. And also the same can be true at the executive level. So often you go into these meetings where you're giving a proposal and you're trying to get that final yes on the decision. You've got a lot of people in there with a lot of different angles that they can look at that problem and so much good experience to draw on. So your CTO is going to have a totally different way of looking at something and different concerns from your chief marketing officer to your head of design. They're all going to look at things differently and be thinking about it differently. And so if you know that you're going to be having a big impact in someone's space and you want to hear from them, it's good to set that meeting up early when you've got some clarity but it's not fully fleshed out and so that you can fold in some of their concerns because they'll have this much broader view. And that also creates people who will be an advocate for you once you get into that room, that final meeting.

(00:27:50):
So I think all of those in the lead up, there's a lot of lead up work to getting buy-in that makes sure that you have a good time in that meeting.

Lenny (00:28:00):
Just to maybe summarize so far, which you've shared, one is just... Basically it's lieu people in early, especially the person that it's going to impact most.

Megan Cook (00:28:08):
I think in addition to that is having that mindset of being open to not necessarily coming up with the right solution, it's more about solving for the problem or the opportunity. So you want to be clear about your hypotheses and what are your facts and what are the principles you're using to make a decision and just be open to not necessarily ending up with the solution you thought would be best.

Lenny (00:28:34):
I imagine most people think they are always in that state, "I am very open to feedback. I am totally open-minded, but really they're not." Is there anything that you think would either convince someone you're actually not as open-minded as you seem or any advice for how to come across as more open-minded? Or is there anything that you see... I see this all the time. People think they're listening, but they're not. You should change.

Megan Cook (00:28:56):
I think one way to force yourself into that situation is to be clear about the hypotheses you have and the facts. So I think often people can present as, "This is absolutely the case. This is what I know, and this is obviously the correct response to the situation." Where most of the time you've got a good set of data, you've got a good understanding with your knowledge of the space, but what is actually going to happen is a hypothesis. There's always going to be something you don't know and oftentimes you don't know until you ship it. That is absolutely the best test of whether or not what you thought was going to happen will actually happen.

(00:29:41):
And so I think when you come to the meeting going, okay, here's the top-back so we actually know, and here's the hypotheses and here's my plan to prove or disprove them, then you're exposing your idea for people to go, oh, here's more that I know about that hypotheses, or here's some data that you don't have or here's another way to think about it. I think people can feel like they're not going to be credible. That you have to come in, you have to come in confident, you have to come in knowing exactly what that solution is going to be. But I usually find that if you come in there open and you're exposed, you're thinking and where you could use some help on perspectives, that actually that builds more credibility because everyone knows that you are not going to have all the answers and you're not going to be able to see the future. And so that can really help in building people's trust in you and that you know what you're doing.

Lenny (00:30:34):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind to make it even more real of either someone on your team doing that or you doing that? Because I think it's still going to be hard for people to realize, "Hey, I'm not actually paying attention to anyone and I just want to convince them this idea is right. This is what we're doing. Just come on, get out of my way. Give me the okay."

Megan Cook (00:30:51):
An example from my past is there was this potential acquisition that we could have made, and I was really, really keen on it because it would mean adding a whole bunch of much needed capability really quickly to the product. And I just loved that momentum and I didn't see any other way that we could do this. I'd looked at a bunch of other options about building it in-house and it just didn't seem possible. And there were a few people that I needed to convince, my boss, but also the head of engineering for the area. And when I took it to them, what I learned was the head of engineering was able to pull a bunch of people from other areas within the company to come and bolster this effort and who had all of the knowledge that we needed. So what seemed like the impossible task, he actually had this extra knowledge to make possible.

(00:31:45):
And in the end, acquisition or not, that doesn't really matter. It's more about being able to get that value back to our customers. That's what we're solving for. And so it was really about coming back, not falling in love with that solution and that other company, it was just taking a step back and going, "Okay, well, really it's just what are we here to do? What's the real goal at the end of the day?"

Lenny (00:32:11):
Awesome. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to share along these lines before I move on to a different topic?

Megan Cook (00:32:16):
The other thing I would say is that setting up the meeting when you finally get there can be really important as well. I often see people go in there and they've got a big document or a presentation or something and they just launch into it. They're really excited. But actually you want to take a step back and you want to be really clear on what are you looking for from that group. You can ask for the decision, you can ask for feedback, you can ask for... You can expose where you're not quite sure about something and you want them to be thinking about that angle in particular and helping test that hypothesis with what they know. And so setting that early, you can put that in people's heads as they read through your document or listen to the rest of the proposal.

(00:33:02):
Then I find it's really useful to have a narrative that just encompasses everything that you're going to talk about. So just really brief, what's the current situation, what has changed and what are the implications that you now want to... We mean we have a problem to solve and an opportunity that we can go after.

(00:33:21):
And the last thing is just making sure you've got your data. There's executives, there's people in the meeting. They're usually across a whole ton of stuff just hearing about... Maybe they've got 10 proposals a day and they're across all different areas in the business, and so they're not going to have the detail that you do. So being really thoughtful about what you bring, what are the key points that are going to help them understand the situation as clearly as possible. But then really knowing your data so that you can dive in more detail where they need it. And that also helps build your credibility and builds people's confidence in the plan to go ahead.

Lenny (00:34:05):
Would you mind just quickly summarizing these pieces of advice and then I was going to move on to another area of strength of yours that I hear?

Megan Cook (00:34:13):
Yeah, sure. So the first one is to find people who are affected negatively or positively or might have a really good point of view and partner with them as you develop the solution or the response to the current situation. And the second one is to come at it with this mindset of being open, of being really key on what is the core problem or the value that you want to deliver, and just being open to how you get there and things that you don't know which might adjust along the way. And the last one is just setting up the meeting walls. So coming in, making sure that it's very clear what you need. Do you need a decision or something like that? And making sure that you've got very good supporting data to build that credibility with your audience.

Lenny (00:35:03):
Love it. This is where the term or the cliche of product managers asking, "But what problem are we trying to solve," comes from. But it comes from a really important place of always focusing on let's all align on here's the problem we're solving. Because oftentimes as you chatted about, the biggest disagreements come from people just thinking they're solving different problems. And on that note, I have a Swag Store now, lennyswag.com, and we have stickers on there, a bunch of cliche PM terms including, "But what problem are we trying to solve?" And so I think that's... But it's rooted in, that's actually a really important question to ask. Sometimes you get annoying.

Megan Cook (00:35:38):
Yeah, that's such a good sticker to have front and center.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Just need that as a big sign. Maybe the sticker needs to be bigger.

Megan Cook (00:35:44):
Exactly.

(00:36:45):
Okay, something else that I hear you're incredibly good at, and it's actually related to all of these things we've been talking about, is the way someone described you is you're really good at fighting the good fight, which essentially is just doing the things that need to be done that aren't necessarily popular or that people are prioritizing right now. I hear that you led to a big investment in CSAT at Atlassian because you just felt like this was the right way of doing it. And there's a few other projects that came out of just like, "I'm just going to do the thing that needs to be done." Can you just talk about why that's important to you, what impact that sort of had, and then just how you actually successfully do that? Obviously it ties into this skill of getting buy-in on stuff.

Megan Cook (00:37:24):
I think that's a really good example actually, the CSAT example, because sometimes you can get caught up in let's add value, add value, add value to the product, but if the customer aren't satisfied with what you built, or in our case we found that one of the core reasons was the usability, it wasn't where it needed to be. Then we can't access that value anyway. It doesn't matter. And sometimes it can be hard to get investment for things like that because it's not like the shiny, exciting new thing. It's no, I want to work on the features we already have and improve those. So it was about two years ago, our chief experience officer, he cared really deeply about improving our CSAT scores and asked me to look into it. And this-

Lenny (00:38:12):
Briefly explain CSAT real quick. Some people may not be familiar with that term.

Megan Cook (00:38:17):
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. Of course. CSAT means customer satisfaction. So for us, we actually have a survey so that we can measure CSAT and it just asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with the product and then different aspects so we can see for different tasks that they need to perform or different aspects of it, like the reliability or the speed or the usability. How do customers feel about that?

Lenny (00:38:48):
We actually had a podcast episode recently Judd, where we talking about NPS and how much there's data showing it's not actually a great predictor of anything, and he's a big fan of CSAT instead. So you could almost think of it as little replacement for NPS in a lot of cases. And I'm sorry, pushed you off track. Keep going.

Megan Cook (00:39:05):
Yeah, no worries. So he cared really deeply about this, asked me to look into it. Even though this request was coming from the top, that doesn't mean that it gets any sort of funding. So we went through a couple of different steps to see what was worth investing in here. First of all, I mentioned we had that survey and so we had really rich feedback. So it's not just a rating, what we get, we get people talking about why they gave that rating and that can really help us zero in on what are the key aspects that's bringing this down. And we also had great conversations with our customers. It was the kinds of conversations that are really rich and really helpful, but so painful to listen to and go through because you're seeing somebody really struggle with something that you thought was going to bring them so much value.

(00:39:58):
And then we had a look at, well, what is this going to impact? And so logically it's what we found was that usability was one of the key reasons, like I said. And logically, if your product is hard to use in places, if some of the core actions are hard for people to do, then a new user to that product or a new customer is going to have a longer ramp up time. You've got a harder time showing them that there's value. And even for an existing customer that's using your product really well, when they bring on a new user, that user might have a really hard time getting up to speed and using it and it just completely slows them down. So from a business point of view, it can impact your new customer acquisition as well as your ability to expand. So there was some good revenue connections in there as well.

(00:40:52):
What I also found was that we have a lot of dependencies. So we've got all of these platform teams and a lot of the improvements that would be really good to make to sort out this problem depended on many, many teams around Atlassian. And they all had different goals and other products that they had to serve too. I don't know if you've ever tried to align three or four different roadmaps so that the timing is just right to get some improvement through, but it's basically impossible. There was no way that was going to happen. But we did find that they were really passionate about this area and improving usability. So we worked together to find a low cost way for those teams to help us make the changes that we need to, but they didn't have to bear the brunt of all the development costs.

(00:41:39):
So each of those teams flipped forward, we call them a shepherd, so that as our developers came in and made changes in the code base that this shepherd would make sure that they weren't causing any issues and we're doing reviews and reviews of designs and things like that. And so getting that buy-in, finding the data to support the reason why this was important. And then we constructed the roadmap so that we found this sort of a low cost, very cheap way to have some impactful change early on. I think that was really, really important. And so we put together just some of the designs for what the experiences were going to look like.

(00:42:24):
So our head of design, Charlie Sutton at the moment has this great mantra of show don't tell. And in this case, it was just at the core of getting people excited because you could show the initial experience, you could show the pain, you could bring in a video of the customer trying to use it and what they thought of it. And that just really brought that emotional aspect to it. It helped get people on board on the issue, the new experience, which is just far and away molds better, might cut out like 20 clicks or whatever. And so all that worked together to get the investment that we needed.

(00:43:04):
I think the last thing that was useful there actually is that we started pretty small too. So I think if you have a hypothesis and you can start small, you can get that investment more easily, you can show success, you can always build on that in the future to get more and more. But in this case, we got about 40 people to come and join onto this. And then as we shipped things, we just made sure that it kept being quite small. And so we got that momentum really quickly. We kept with regular updates, we kept up the excitement about what the team was doing.

(00:43:38):
At one stage, the team picked out something that was pretty impactful throughout the whole thing. So that was dark mode. That took a lot of coordination around the whole company to make that thing happen. But it was well overdue, we loved it. And then the feedback that we got as well really helps with that. Actually just yesterday, I saw some feedback on one of the changes we'd made recently, and this customer said it was the best quality of life improvement they've seen in a long time, which just the way that's phrased even, that gets you excited about the impact that you're having on that person.

Lenny (00:44:20):
And this was the CSAT work or the dark mode?

Megan Cook (00:44:24):
This was CSAT work. This was improving one of the processes.

Lenny (00:44:28):
Okay, cool. That's amazing. There's a lot of stuff I love about this story. One is just the power of just empowering yourself to do things that you believe need to be done. There's a lot of PMs and just people in general that just assume they don't have any power and the square peg they're in is just all they're going to be able to do and nobody's going to allow them to do things that they believe are important and no one else agrees with. So I think there's just a lot of power in just understanding that you have more power and leverage and agency than you probably think you do, but then you also have to do it well. So I took a bunch of notes as you were talking of the things that I think are core to getting stuff like this done, just a scrappy project that you're kind of doing on your own without a lot of buy-in from the top initially.

(00:45:14):
So I want to stay small. Two is make it visual and visceral so you can like, "Oh wow, I could see this being amazing," and getting people excited as you go. Making it really easy for people I think is a really interesting takeaway there. Just like, "We did all the work for you already for these other teams, it's going to be so easy. It's not going to be a lot of work for you." And then showed the data like, "Here's what we've gotten from CSAT so far, here's the impact you'll probably get from it. Here's how much work it'll take." Show actual data. And then keep it scrappy. It feels like a lot of this is just like stay small, keep it scrappy, don't ask for a lot of resources initially and just kind of show momentum.

Megan Cook (00:45:50):
I think that's really important. When you keep it scrappy and small in the beginning, it doesn't feel like it's as big of a bet, but that gives you the opportunity to really prove that the direction that you're going in could pay off. And so it's sort of like this little inroad to getting more investment.

Lenny (00:46:07):
Awesome. Okay. I want to move to a different topic around Atlassian as a company, but is there anything else you wanted to share along those lines before we do that?

Megan Cook (00:46:15):
No, let's go for it.

Lenny (00:46:17):
Okay. One of the most interesting things about Atlassian to me is it's a great example of a company that's been able to launch new product lines. This is the dream of every software company business in general is you start with one product that gets to a certain point and then you hit some kind of plateau, and then you add an additional business product line, and then you add more and more. Somewhere around Atlassian's 15 products. Is that an accurate number?

Megan Cook (00:46:43):
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we are up to 15. Yes.

Lenny (00:46:45):
Jesus Christ. Amazing. So this is very rare and the dream of many companies. And so I'm just curious what it is you think Atlassian has done so right to have so many successful individual products?

Megan Cook (00:46:59):
You know what, it's not like we added the first product and got it just right way off the bat. So yeah, 15, we've had a lot of shots at this, so I might talk about two examples. I think the first one, if I think about Jira software, it started just as a really humble bug tracker. That was it. There wasn't as much to it, and then it sort of weathered these massive changes in how people build software. So it launched in 2003. And if I remember correctly, just to date this, the mobile phone that was most popular at the time was the Nokia 6100. I don't know if you ever had one of those.

Lenny (00:47:41):
I don't remember what that specific one was, but I'm picturing a Nokia phone. It's like a little small brick.

Megan Cook (00:47:47):
Yeah, it was my mother-in-law's favorite phone. It took us forever to get her off that onto something better. But there's a lot that's changed since that time. There's been agile, there's been cloud. And what we saw recently was more in the expansion of software teams. So they used to be extremely developer centric. And I think most people when they think about Jira software, they think, oh, that must be, well, 80% developers that are using it. But actually it's more like 50% or maybe just shy of 50% are developers. And the rest is this huge mix of support in operations, in sales and marketing, finance, design, HR, legal, just this massive mix of everybody, all the roles you could think of in a company basically that get in there and make work happen.

(00:48:36):
And so what we saw years ago was, well, software teams aren't just developers anymore. And we saw this in our teams as well, but we saw that these other teams, the finance, the marketing teams, even design teams were sort of cobbling together their own solutions. So Jira software is incredibly flexible, which is a massive pro of it. That these teams were seeing software teams get more effective at the way they were getting work done and collaborating better. And they wanted that same benefit and they started using Jira, but we hadn't set it up well for them at all. So it was quite difficult for them to do that. But the positive was that there was this really good signal from our users that they were looking for more from us, and we knew that your marketing team is going to work differently from your developer team. That's how it should be. And so we started Jira work management to be more focused on all of these other use cases outside of the software team that our users were asking us to go ahead and solve.

(00:49:36):
So that was a really great way to discover the need for a new product. Were these really strong signals from within our customers in that same area of business that we're really well set up to help them learn.

Lenny (00:49:50):
What was that process like from noticing, "Hey, designers are using Jira and they're not having a good time. PMs are using Jira, researchers, and here's the issues they're running." So just that insight of like, "Oh, interesting. There might be an opportunity here to launching." I don't know the first version. I don't know if you're actually involved in this, but whatever you can share would be awesome. Where there design partners they all chose and like let's work with Salesforce and Microsoft and make sure they love it? How long was that process? Because I think that's the prop people are so curious about just how do we validate and discover and then actually launch something that's going to work.

Megan Cook (00:50:28):
Yeah, I was just as close to that one, but I can give you a second example.

Lenny (00:50:33):
Oh, great.

Megan Cook (00:50:35):
Yeah, for sure. The second example actually came from our product internal innovation program and that we let anyone pitch an idea for new product in the company if they want to. So we had this wonderful product manager, Tammy Carson, who saw a demand for a solution for product managers to build their roadmaps a bit better before ideas get committed. So as you know, this is fuzzy area before you actually start building something as a product manager where you're looking at lots of opportunities and ideas and you're prioritizing them. And it's not really confirmed real work yet. And nobody wanted to put that in Jira because once it was in Jira, then everyone just expected it to happen. And so this is where Jira product discovery came from.

(00:51:24):
And in the past we'd tried things like this before in new products at Atlassian and they've been successful, but it'd been really hard because large parts of the company process and those checks were optimizing for the success of the bigger products like Jira software. And so we changed that to create really small groups with stage gates that we call wonder, explore, make, impact, and then getting to scale. And that meant to assess those bets at every stage. And the idea was to iterate really quickly, either to it not working out and proving that it couldn't be a business or iterate really quickly to yes it could and we should invest more in this. And so with each stage there would be a little bit of investment.

(00:52:12):
So you say that for a stage of wonder might just be the person with the idea. And then explore, you might add on a couple more people, like three people to go and really have a look at, here's a prototype, here are some customers that'd be interested in it and could help us think about this some more and put together what the roadmap looks like. And then when you get to make that's when you get a full team, but a full team is going to be 12 people or so, it's still not huge. And I think that's really important because at each stage you're getting validation, you're getting more customers who are interested and invested in helping you develop what that solution looks like.

(00:52:56):
You asked about whether we went and partnered with a partner company like Salesforce for something like this, for a new product. In this case it was just really partnering heavily with our customers where we saw that interest coming through in our other products like Jira software and building something that really works for them before expanding it to more and more customers and finding that product market fit and then upping the investment. And so we've had a couple of new products recently that have gone through that sort of stage rollout. So there's Jira Product Discovery, there's Atlas that I mentioned before, and I think Compass is the latest one.

Lenny (00:53:36):
So what I'm hearing here is essentially there's this step-by-step gated process that you put new product ideas through and they make it one step at a time. And I imagine there's a leader that can decide, "No, this one's not working out. Let's end it at the explorer phase and invest in other ideas." I imagine

Megan Cook (00:53:56):
Yeah, that's right. It might be someone who's looking after that particular market. At each one of those stages, there's that check on whether or not we continue to go ahead.

Lenny (00:54:08):
And the stages are wonder. I like that a lot. That's a great name. Explore, make, and then what were the other ones?

Megan Cook (00:54:16):
Impact and scale.

Lenny (00:54:18):
Got it. So impact is like is it showing any impact? We made it, is it working? And then scale. Got it. That makes sense. Just like let's go for it.

Megan Cook (00:54:25):
Yeah. Impact could be I can be self-sufficient in the revenue that I'm generating, and scale is just really launching it to take off.

Lenny (00:54:35):
Launch it. Yeah, it goes on the website. Okay. So wonder is like a PM and an engineer maybe at Hackathon where we have an idea. Explore is they maybe get a little bit of resourcing and they start exploring the idea, build the prototype, maybe find a design partner too, to think about this. Is that roughly right?

Megan Cook (00:54:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:52):
Okay.

Megan Cook (00:54:52):
Make sure you've got a clear roadmap. Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:54):
Okay, got it. And then make, is that where they expand it to a few more customers and make it more fully featured?

Megan Cook (00:55:04):
Yeah. Make is where you'd actually build it. So the prototype-

Lenny (00:55:09):
Okay, got it.

Megan Cook (00:55:10):
... could be pretty simple, could be a bit cobbled together, make is actually building the product and see if you can get more and more customers.

Lenny (00:55:14):
Got it.

Megan Cook (00:55:15):
That's where you'd start to make it with those customers.

Lenny (00:55:19):
This is really interesting because again, I think Atlassian is one of the very few companies that has done this so well. And I don't know, this number is absurd. I've never heard of another company that's 15 successful products. I don't know how successful they're, but they're out there and people seem to be... They're being promoted. I guess is there any other advice to share along the lines of if someone is thinking about launching a second product, anything you would suggest they do or think about they may not be thinking about?

Megan Cook (00:55:42):
I think my advice is skied towards the Atlassian case, which is where you're in a 12,000 strong employee company and how do you seed something that you want to run as more with more of a startup kind of mindset. So when you get to this size, you've got quarterly planning and business reviews and all of these different process and you don't necessarily want to put your seed startup through that. It's not quite ready for that kind of thing. So I think the key things here that make it really successful is starting really small with the idea and the solution to be proved and don't add too many people, don't feel pressured to add too many people. I think it's easy to get really excited about the potential and just want to throw four or five teams at it, but that can... We were talking about this stat. That can make things run slower and so you want to protect them.

(00:56:39):
And the second thing is just give them freedom to move really fast and solve those problems in a different way. So there are different expectations. They don't necessarily need to be a part of that process that I was talking about before. This team should just be running hard to prove whether or not the idea's going to work and whether there's product market fit.

(00:56:59):
And for different approaches. If I want to add something to Jira software, but we're talking millions and millions of users there, that thing has to be resilient. It's got to scale. There are all these things that users inherently expect from something like that. But for something small like this, we are proving product market fit. You don't need to think about that initially. So you've got to hold this to a different standard, otherwise you're just going to slow them down way too much.

(00:57:25):
And actually we found that by letting them tackle problems a little differently, we found innovative way of looking at things that we can pull back into our other products. So for example, if you look at Jira Product Discovery, and just the way that it gives more of a spreadsheet kind of view of a list of ideas and things like that, some of the experience there is definitely something that we'll be pulling into Jira software.

Lenny (00:58:00):
You mentioned that over the years, Jira has weathered many storms. From my perspective, it feels like it continues to weather many storms incredibly well. One, because there's just endless startups always coming at Jira trying to become the new project management tool that everyone uses. And two, it just feels like people are always dissing on Jira like, "Jira sucks, I want to use something else." On the other hand, it continues to dominate. Many people love it. I'm curious what you believe Atlassian generally has done and your team has done to keep Jira ahead of everyone. And I know you're probably going to say, "We listen to customers better than anyone." So if that's a big part of the answer, definitely share that. But I'm curious, is there anything else people may not be recognizing of just why Jira has been so successful for so long?

Megan Cook (00:58:46):
Yeah. I think the number of startups that enter this space, just so it shows how important the problem is that we solve and that problem of teamwork and collaboration. We've got more than 125,000 customers around the world who start their day in Jira, millions of users and the kinds of companies that use it. I just love hearing about what they do with it. They really blow me away. Like NASA landing the Mars rover or Canva building this design platform for 40 million people, it's just massive.

Lenny (00:59:23):
I don't think you can beat that Mars rover story array. That's a good one. I think when you follow it up with the Canvas story, that one's less interesting now, but it's also amazing. Okay. Sorry. Keep going.

Megan Cook (00:59:33):
So like you said, they are integral to our success. We do obsess over them. We think if we do right by them, then we're going to be going in the right direction. I don't think we've ever had this sense of arrogance of just... No matter how big we are, we've always got this healthy dose of paranoia that we need to keep working on improving things and being better. So to your point about customer feedback, that is a big part of it. We bake in these rituals just to make it super easy for everyone to do that. So the whole company gets an email every week and it's just got a random selection of feedback from our customers. It's got how they rate us and just a quote as well. And so everyone's sort of getting this dose of feedback all the time.

(01:00:24):
We have regular share outs of all of the research that everyone gets. We get in-product feedback. We make it super easy to talk to our customers through social media or LinkedIn or X now. And then we also have a whole community space where customers can have longer conversations with us about different ideas that we're coming up with or feedback that they have for us. So I think that is all massively important for keeping Jira ahead of the pack.

(01:00:58):
I think how we stay ahead in other areas is just that the culture is super, super open to innovation, kind of invites innovation. So we have these hackathons, we call them shepherd. The whole company stops and everyone can play with new ideas or technologies. It's a competition. So the best ideas get visibility. It can get people working with other people that they wouldn't normally. And also the visibility of the ideas helps generate more ideas all over the place.

(01:01:31):
Like I said before, innovation can come from anywhere. So anyone can pitch new ideas or products. And when we see new technologies emerging that we think are going to be really foundational and interesting, we'll carve off a team to go and look at that. So I think we've had an AI team central to Atlassian for a long time, but with the advent of ChatGPT, there's sort of this huge move forward. There's this leak that's happening. And so in my team, I just carved off a small team to go and explore that and see what interesting things that we could do there.

(01:02:09):
I think we don't shy away from tackling subsets of the market that we're seeing that need a bit more love, like the Jira Product Discovery story that we were just talking about a second ago. And we also use our products a lot and that helps us find all of those little problems and makes it really real. We get really excited about the different things that the whole team is working on. We send lots of feedback to each other. I think that's also a really important part of it.

(01:02:42):
Another area is when we look at how we're investing, there's always this pressure to invest in the core business, of course, but we also make sure that we invest in seeding future businesses. And like we're talking about, they might not always work out. So we had then the Compass and the Atlas example of ones that have worked out, but we also see things through Atlassian inventions. So if there are interesting ideas or technologies, these might support the products later on, that's something that we'll go and seed out there in the market. And that's led to a few acquisitions there as well, which has been really useful.

(01:03:21):
And the last thing is I think I am just really impressed at the way that we stay agile to move towards these different shifts that come up. It always surprises me just how agile we can be. For example, in 2020 we decided to double down on our mission to deliver a world-class cloud experience. And it was like hundreds of people just moved around in Atlassian to make that happen, which was in a very short period of time, which was impressive. And we're not shy about killing things off with their [inaudible 01:03:55]. So I'll give you another example of one of those products that was going through that we ended up killing off. So we had a whiteboard product that we thought would be its own product, sort of like a Jira Product Discovery. And when we came to one of those gates with the team, we realized actually this is more a really useful document type. And so now you'll see that it's a feature in Confluence. It was very quick to make that decision.

Lenny (01:04:28):
I have this new segment, not that new anymore, called Failure Corner. I'm curious if you have any interesting story of a big failure in your career. And if you do, what you learned from that experience?

Megan Cook (01:04:41):
I think I'll give you a bit of a different one because I think this one is harder to spot and I think that's really interesting. It's something that I think about all the time though. So I missed a really big opportunity to move Atlassian forward back in the day. And I, like I said, think about it every time I review a new idea or look at an opportunity that we're thinking about.

(01:05:06):
So I was on this team and I was improving the way that our products help developers get their work done. And so typically we saw them start in Jira software. They'd pick up a piece of work and then they'd switch tools. They'd create a brand, they'd start writing code. And we noticed that they would forget to come back and update the status of their work and this could create a lot of confusion in the team. Another developer could pick up that work thinking it wasn't started and then there was a lot of wasted time. Or if you're trying to track metrics like how long does it take for a piece of work to get started through to done? That'll totally ski things. So this was causing a lot of problems.

(01:05:42):
But we didn't want to make developers come back into the tool that was obviously something that was getting in the way of their work. So we decided to build automation so they didn't have to leave their ID or the command line to do that. They can just keep working. So an example is Jira would detect that a new command had been created and then it could automatically move your piece of work to in progress because there's code being written against it. And there were a whole bunch of these examples that parties integrated into it and I made the decision to put into Jira as a user was editing their workflow and we shipped it and it performed just fine. People discovered it, they used it, and seemed to give a lot of value. People liked it, which doesn't really sound like a fail. I don't think that...

(01:06:33):
Where I dropped the ball was more about what I should have realized about that feature. So automation, it's super useful. It can be used by a whole slew of people who aren't just developers. It could be used in every single product. It's more than just moving things to a new status. And so I should have realized that we could have built this amazing service that every product could have moved themselves forward with. And years later, Atlassian actually acquired a company that did exactly that, this advanced automation. And it's in every product now. And so you can imagine how much it costs to acquire a company. That was a really extensive mistake on my part. So when I see a new idea, I'm always asking myself, "How do we push this further? Is there something there that we can 10X? Can we apply it more broadly to more types of users, more products? Is there some bigger opportunity that we can really take advantage of?"

Lenny (01:07:31):
That's an awesome story. So the lesson there is just think bigger with the products. You almost need to wait for it to first be successful for you just to be like, "Oh, but can we do something more with this?" Do you think you should have been thinking about that as you were building it or would that have been too early?

Megan Cook (01:07:47):
No, I think I should have caught that as we were building it, because even when I think about the experience, so it was a really good proving ground for it for sure. But even when I think about the experience, just where that experience was designed and product limited its functionality, which is a real shame.

Lenny (01:08:07):
I guess the takeaway there is just if you're committing to some idea, ask yourself what would it look like if this was 10 times bigger? If this was a bigger deal, can this apply to other things we're doing? Is that right?

Megan Cook (01:08:21):
Yeah. Where could this go in three years, five years? And should that change the way that you think about it now?

Lenny (01:08:29):
Great advice. Megan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or is there anything you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Megan Cook (01:08:39):
I'll leave you with something. And it's just this practice that I've found really useful for my squad that we've implemented pretty recently, and especially with remote work and all of that. So like I said, we have limited time together, but what we put into place is something we called Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about fight club.

Lenny (01:09:05):
Everyone knows that.

Megan Cook (01:09:08):
It's 30 minutes every week. And it's just for myself, my engineering and my design leader, and we get together and we know that we're going in there to have a conflict. I think often when there's difficult conversations or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific sort of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement and it makes it much better. And I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.

Lenny (01:09:53):
This is super cool. It's like couples therapy or something where you're just like, "What issues do we have? Let's work through them right now." I love that. I love that. And it makes it okay to bring up things that are bothering you and things that you think need to change. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Megan Cook (01:10:12):
Yes, can't wait. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:10:14):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Megan Cook (01:10:19):
Look, I have a habit of sending books to everyone who reports to me every year just on a skill they're working on. So I've got a huge list that I actually send out, but the one that I send out the most to new PMs especially is just inspired by Marty Cagan. It holds up really well. It was recommended to me by my first boss, and it's just got a bunch of great tips in there, just great foundational knowledge.

(01:10:49):
More recently, what I've been sending out for my managers is Scaling People by Claire Hughes Johnson. I think that just came out within the last year actually, but it's just got an incredible amount of really useful tactical things, templates, all sorts of things that you can put into practice.

Lenny (01:11:11):
Great choices. We have both in the bookshelf behind me. Both of them have been on the podcast. I wish I could see the whole list of books that you recommend to people. If you don't have this written out anywhere, you should publish some kind of blog or newsletter post of here's the skill and here's the book you recommend.

Megan Cook (01:11:26):
Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Thanks.

Lenny (01:11:29):
Right, you have a homework assignment. Okay, next question. What is the favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Megan Cook (01:11:35):
I am so late to TV, but Foundation is the one that I've been binging lately, and I think it's just this huge world. And I'm not usually one that gets super into sci-fi, but the way that it brings forward some of these ideas for what new technologies could mean... If you haven't seen it, and this is really spoiling it, one of the main characters or three of the main characters are actually clones of this emperor who rules the universe and decided to clone himself at three different stages of his life so that those people could continue rolling. And I think even that idea just invites the idea of what if we stretched out human life? What are the impact? How do things advance when you've got that same mindset and same people continue on? It's super compelling.

Lenny (01:12:28):
Foundation, the show got ruined for me by reading the books many, many years ago, is one of my favorite sci-fi trilogy of all time. And then I was so excited for the show and has nothing to do with the books, basically. It's like the storyline is completely different, the core idea is the same as the only real. So I just got tired of it and stopped. But if you haven't read the books, I think you would love it. It's beautiful.

Megan Cook (01:12:50):
Are the books better?

Lenny (01:12:53):
Yeah, the books are better. The books are always better, I think is a good rule of thumb.

Megan Cook (01:13:00):
Yeah, that is a good rule. I'll probably pick that up.

Lenny (01:13:00):
Yeah. I was like a teenager when I read them, so I don't know. Maybe they suck, but I think people love them. Highly recommend the books if you liked the show especially. Next question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates?

Megan Cook (01:13:12):
I think it's an old one, but a great one on the subject of failure. I love to ask people about their biggest failure and I think it's a good way to get to know somebody because you can see how introspective they are, how much they think about what's happened and what they learned from it. It shows whether or not they can be vulnerable with you. You can see what they consider to be a big failure. Some people will list something that's not really a failure. And also you can see about whether they've got that growth mindset. So have they learned something from that? Have they applied it moving forward?

(01:13:51):
Weird rule that I've found is that a lot of the best hires that I've had has had big failure stories that they've worked through and learned from. And so I think that's great to see what they consider there, what the learnings are, but also in the solution you can also see how they tackle something like that. So are they the type of person who wants to go and forge something all by themselves? Are they the type of person who will pull together a community to figure something out? So you get that insight into their values and their approach from that question too, which is hugely useful.

Lenny (01:14:30):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Megan Cook (01:14:34):
Yeah. You might have to stop me from going on and on about this, but I recently got a smoker, a Traeger smoker for smoking meat. And just the unboxing experience was incredible. So you get this huge box, cardboard box, you open it up. If you reverse the cardboard box, it becomes like a play saloon that your kid can jump into and just mess around in which-

Lenny (01:15:02):
Wow, that's cool.

Megan Cook (01:15:03):
... rather than just throwing it out, it becomes something really cool and useful. The set of instructions has a six-pack of beer at the top, just helps you understand how far through you should be through your six-pack as you're constructing it. You get some tools with it. And they're really good actually. They're not the usual kind of throwaway tools that you get in something to put together something like this. In addition to that sort of playful delightfulness in there, as you build it, you discover things along the way. So I opened up the hopper where you put in your wood pellets and there was a baseball cap, a tray of baseball cap in there, which was unexpected and really cool. And then the whole experience of actually using it once you've set it up is amazing. So it's all connected to my phone. I can just head to the beach and have some brisket going and come home and it's beautifully done. It just works. It's integrated. It's got integrated recipes. Yeah, I love that. I like that one.

Lenny (01:16:12):
And salt. That sounds so delightful. Such a great product experience. I'm going to have to get one I think. I think we're going to sell some Traeger smokers.

Megan Cook (01:16:17):
Sure.

Lenny (01:16:22):
Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, either in work or in life?

Megan Cook (01:16:28):
It's around maximizing joy. And what I mean by that is it's about finding what's important and leaning into it or finding what's annoying and turning it into something I enjoy. To give you a super small example is I'm terrible with keys. I will leave that thing all over the place. You'll find it in my cutlery drawer or whatever, and I'll never find it again. And I think an obvious solution to that could be to put a hook on the wall or something where you can just leave them and you go back to that and it's easy to find. But what gives me joy is not actually having to have keys at all. And so now I have a fingerprint reader on my front door and I feel a little bit like James Bond every time I enter my house and I can let people in if somebody needs to leave a package or something that's easy to do. So it was turning something annoying into something more joyful.

(01:17:24):
And I think the other thing there is just I really value keeping great relationships and increasing those relationships. And so I always make time for these amazing friends that I have that live in London, and we have this pact where every time either one of us goes to the others' continent, we'll go meet them there. So every time I go to Europe, which last year I was in Berlin, at one point in Amsterdam, and on the plane, they came over and we just hung out and had a great time. And so it's making sure that you make time for those important things.

Lenny (01:18:00):
Along the same lines, final question related to creating more joy. I noticed a beautiful surfboard behind you. For somebody that's trying to surf and maybe not being successful, what's one tip you could share with listeners to improve their success with surfing?

Megan Cook (01:18:18):
Isn't surfing the most humbling sport that you've ever tried?

Lenny (01:18:22):
Yeah, I've tried a few times and yeah, I would say so.

Megan Cook (01:18:29):
I think surfing's really interesting. I've never done a sport like it in that it's something that you have to really feel. So I find every time you learn and you think about surfing, you sort of feel it before you know how to do it. So even just being able to catch a wave, a green pace wave, you're paddling, you're paddling, you don't quite know where to be, you don't quite know how much to paddle for that wave, and you just have to sort of be successful a couple times before you get the feel for it. And it's the same with trying to find the right wave. When I looked at the ocean the first time to try and pick the wave and pick where to be, I couldn't even see the shape of it to find that right place. It took me just seeing a hundred waves to be able to do that.

(01:19:15):
So my best tip for surfing is get out there, keep doing it, do it over and over and over again. You will get better. You'll start to see all of these things that you've never noticed before. And get some friends. Get some friends out there, get surfing accountability buddy to make sure that you're getting out there often.

Lenny (01:19:37):
He's the best buddy. Amazing. Megan, we've talked about play and safety and buy-in and fighting the good fight and adding new product lines, also surfing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Megan Cook (01:19:55):
The best place to find me is on LinkedIn. I'm Megan Cook on LinkedIn. You can also find me if you're a customer in the Atlassian community, if you want to have a chat. And I'm also on social media, so on X, you can find me there as well. And be useful to me. Look, any feedback, absolutely any feedback on Jira software, always hungry for that. Also, really keen, if you want to just chat about how people's ways of working are evolving and shifting and changing, and how do you think that's going to turn out and how you see your goals for your team changing. I would love to talk about that. Please get in touch.

Lenny (01:20:37):
Awesome. Megan, thank you so much for being here.

Megan Cook (01:20:40):
Thank you, Lenny. It's been fun.

# She turned 100+ rejections into a $42B company | Melanie Perkins

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
There's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:06):
It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback. Often in the form of rejection, they would say, "Oh, your market's not big enough," and I would say, "It's going to be huge." And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was, and then they'd say, "You're the same as some of other company." And I would say, "Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
One of your values, Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:35):
The thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. You want to work really hard to will it into existence. I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want Right now? I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck.

Melanie Perkins (00:00:59):
So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite an embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):
A lot of people think of Canva as like design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, whiteboards, charts, AI coding tool.

Melanie Perkins (00:01:24):
Was funny, looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:30):
Today my guest is Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva. Melanie is on track to be the most successful female tech founder in history and one of the most successful founders, period. Canva is currently valued at over $42 billion, making over $3.3 billion in revenue a year. They've been profitable for eight years straight and are one of the hottest private tech companies in the world right now. But it wasn't always this way. Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors when she was trying to raise her first round. Their team spent two years rewriting their entire code base and were unable to ship any new features for over two years, something they expected to just take six months, and they even went through a big pivot early on from a yearbook publishing platform to the Canva that you know today, Melanie does not do a lot of podcasts. She shares stories that I've never heard before and lessons that I'm still thinking about.

(00:02:21):

(00:04:49):
Melanie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Melanie Perkins (00:04:53):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
I'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here. I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built. Also just everyone I meet from Canva is just so nice and so awesome and so smart, and so clearly you've built something really special. I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that. We were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour. I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva. You described something called building a Column B company and Column B thinking, I've never heard of this before, so let us start there. What is building Column B company, what does that mean?

Melanie Perkins (00:05:35):
Really great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning. The way that you can plan is you can dream of what is the perfect vision of the future, what future do you want to exist in, what would you like the world to look like? What would you like companies to look like? And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream, and then working hard to turn that into reality. And the alternate is, so just imagine you are building a castle on the hill and you're like, "What would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience?" And the other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you and you can say, "What can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do?" And I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them, and then you can create only so much. And so I guess the column B thinking is thinking about what is that magical wonderful future that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building? And so that's column A and column B in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):
So column A is the traditional just work from today's world. Column B is work from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that.

Melanie Perkins (00:06:44):
Exactly that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):
This is exactly the way actually Brian Chesky thought. I worked at Airbnb for a long time and it was always just, "Think about the world, the dream and then work backwards from that," so there's a lot clearly also worked out. So clearly this is an important lesson in the example of Canva, just what would've been column A for what Canva could have been and how did you think about the column B approach of what Canva in a dreamland could be?

Melanie Perkins (00:07:07):
So column A would've been nothing frankly, because the reality was when I was a university student with no company and no business or product or software experience, the reality would've been not very much. And so it was all column B, it was all thinking about the wild future that we wanted to create. Imagine what would be publishing in the future, what would communications look like in the future? And it seemed really impossible that it would stay on the desktop, it would stay really complicated. And it just seemed so apparent to me that in the future it was going to be completely different. Could I build that future? I had absolutely no idea, but the idea, it seemed completely likely, completely improbable that it wouldn't be the case that in the future, design would be online and collaborative and really simple. And so starting from that, we then took that concept and applied it to the school yearbook market in Australia with our first company Fusion Books. And then we applied it to Canva where we wanted to take it much, much bigger.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
Let's talk about just how to actually go about building a Column B company. Say a founder is listening to this and they're just like, "Okay, I want to do this." What do they do? What are the steps? Where do you start?

Melanie Perkins (00:08:17):
I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want? What is the world that you want to live in? What is the future of transportation? What is the future of healthcare? What is the future that you want to live in and exist in? And for example, right now I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050. And so it's not necessarily that you can bring that into existence or you can will that into existence, but just to start to get clearer on what you would like that world to be like. Would you like it to be more inclusive? Would you like it? For me, one of the things I desperately want is everyone on this planet to have their basic human needs met.

(00:08:56):
What are those things that you believe are so important that you would love to see exist in that future? And I think an exercise we often do is what is wild success for X, or what is wild success for Y? And then equally, what is terrible failure for those things? And you can apply that just to abstract thinking in different industries. You can do that, apply that. We do that for the whole company for different areas of the company. And I think just taking that very long timescale of 10 years and getting a really crisp idea of what you want, of what you don't want, that's sort of the first step. And I think a lot of people don't spend quite enough time imagining that. And then the next part is you don't want to just have this crazy big dream and then do nothing about turning it into reality.

(00:09:43):
You kind of want to have a ladder that goes all the way up to the moon, which is your crazy, wild vision. And then you want to have rungs that just work its way up step by step. And so you want to get that really clear picture of the future that you would like and then just take little step, after little step, after little step. And it doesn't matter how small that first step is or how seemingly inconsequential if it is working towards that future that you want to will into existence, then you'll keep on climbing up that ladder in the right direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):
I think a lot of people hearing this might feel like, "I do this. Yeah, I have a vision. I know where I'm going. I have this big idea." What do you think they might be missing about just what this actually means and why they're probably not thinking big enough, they're not making the time to think this.

Melanie Perkins (00:10:23):
I think it is easy to be discouraged by the two, because they're completely two complete odds. They're completely different ends of the spectrum. So one is dreaming about the future, not that you think you can will into existence, it's just the future that you want. And then the next part is taking the tiny step that might be extremely microscopic and it feels a little embarrassing to be like, "I want a future that is," whatever it might be. And then to take such a microscopic step because I think you often have the future in one side or don't spend much time thinking about that. You're just thinking about the bricks before you. And so I think it's also naturally we all get distracted by day-to-day. It's your email, your Slack, the things that are kind of in your face, the reality that lives around you every day that kind of pulls you into this moment right now.

(00:11:14):
And so I think actually just making time to spend thinking about that is probably one of the most critical pieces. Just literally dreaming what is wild success in 10 years, what is terrible failure in 10 years is a really great place to start, is just spending some time there. And then even if that is so big and so vast and so wild, having that very first step is so important because then you take that little tiny first step and then the next step then that compounds for us, it's been compounding over a decade as we continue to work towards that same mission and vision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):
I want to hear how you operationalize this. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck. Talk about what that looks like, because I think that's where people are like, "Okay, how do I actually do this?" Talk about that deck.

Melanie Perkins (00:12:04):
So we have this concept of chaos to clarity and every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. And so chaos can be an idea, it can be a problem, it can be a philosophy or a belief. And I've got a joke that I find funny. I'm not sure if you will, but how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity. And so the idea is that each little step from chaos to clarity is the very first step might be literally writing it down. So rather than it being in your head, you've written it down, then the next step might be starting to create a pitch deck on it. And the next step might be starting to refine that, turning it into some designs, turning into a prototype. And then as it kind of goes from chaos to clarity, it starts to become more and more real and more and more people can see it. And so just taking those little incremental steps that adds clarity with every single step, then starts to help will it into existence rather than it being something that's completely amorphous and just stays in your head. So I think that's why visual communication for us is so important, is because otherwise, if it's just in your head, no one else can see it and you can't will it into existence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:13):
This makes me think about this concept of an ugly baby from the book, Creativity Inc., by I think Ed Catmull where he talks about how new ideas or this ugly baby that nobody wants to look at and deal with that I think he says they want to kill. I don't know why you would do that with an ugly baby. But there are these very soft, fragile things and it's really important to not kill them early and give them a chance to survive. And it's kind what I'm hearing here is have this big vision that many people are be like, "No, wait. This is completely absurd." And I love this idea of, "Okay, but here's one step we could take there to see if this could be a thing."

Melanie Perkins (00:13:48):
Yeah, I completely agree. And I think that's the thing is that that very first step at the very far end of chaos, it's very embarrassing because you're like, "I have this idea that is so big and so wild and how the hell would I do that? I have no idea." And so it's quite a embarrassing step, actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers. In fact, you have likely none of the answers, but you just have the idea that you think would be cool. And ideally you get the idea that it would be so cool that you want to work really hard to will that into existence. And so I think one of the really key parts is not only just having the idea but thinking it's so cool that you're going to work for years to will it into existence. Actually Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about the vision of, I won't go into the details right here, but the vision of her space and I was really excited about it. And so I think that that's the great thing about a pitch deck, is that other people can see your thinking and your thinking actually gets clarified as well as you go through that process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
I talked to Melissa, I talked to a bunch of other people that work at Canva, that have worked at Canva, and something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, Crazy Big Goals, which I think is one of your values. Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value. Why is that so important? How does that fit into this? And just talk about the power of having Crazy Big Goals.

Melanie Perkins (00:15:08):
Yeah, so right from the start of Canva, it was truly a crazy-big goal. We're like, "We want to empower the world of design and take all these things that are super complicated and put them into one platform and make it accessible to the whole world. And we want to, rather than it be super expensive and unaffordable, we want to empower everyone everywhere in the world to design." So I mean, that was the epitome of a crazy big goal. And if we macro out even further, we've got this two-step plan, build one of the world's most valuable companies and do the most good we can do. So again, a rather crazy big goal. And I think the thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. Another crazy big goal. We'd love to see everyone's basic human needs met on the planet. Completely crazy big, that truly shouldn't be. It's kind of absolutely absurd that that's the case, but we can go into that later.

(00:16:02):
But I think with a crazy big goal, then you want to work really hard to will it into existence. And so if you start with a reasonable goal or a realistic goal, then you kind of get to it and you're like, "Oh cool, whatever." Or more importantly, if something happens, all the problems and roadblocks come along as they always do, then you're like, "Okay, I won't bother with that." And then you can just go and choose another course. And so a crazy big goal is both crazy big, but it's also something that you think is incredibly important that you actually want to will into existence because it is so much work to will a crazy big goal into existence. So it better be one that you want to actually achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):
Is there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind maybe as a good example of, "This is what I'm talking about?" Maybe a product you launched or feature back in the day?

Melanie Perkins (00:16:53):
Yeah, I mean so many things. So we have our mission to empower the world to design and we break it down into mission pillars. So empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, obviously a mouthful. But then what we do is we take successive goals every year towards this mission. And so for designing anything, we started off with social media and presentations and docs and websites and whiteboards and video. And so every year we're just launching more and more things to fulfill that part of the mission of empowering everyone to design anything. And then equally in every language we started in English and then it was Spanish and then it was 20 languages and then a hundred languages and then hard languages like Arabic and Hebrew and Urdu and right to left languages. And now we're in a hundred plus languages now and now we're really doubling down on the localization experience to make it feel truly local in every market around the world.

(00:17:47):
And so you can see how having these very big, audacious goals that you then just take a step after step towards helps then will it into existence or on every device. We started off obviously just with a web platform and then we launched our iPad app and then iPhone and then Android and then we spent years investing in cross-platform. So we have the same feature set across every device. And so you can see how these big amorphous things that seem very outlandish, you can then just will into existence after continual investment for a decade and it compounds over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
I see how all this is starting to fade together. There's this big crazy ambitious vision and below there are the mission pillars that are feeding into this vision and then the Crazy Big Goals within each of those mission pillars to measure your progress towards all these components of the mission.

Melanie Perkins (00:18:32):
Exactly, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:34):
Okay, so with all that in mind, there's also this kind of trade-off you have to make of just how ambitious you get because oftentimes sometimes maybe you never miss the goal, but many times people miss these very ambitious goals. How do you just find that balance between ambitious crazy but doable enough where people don't get discouraged?

Melanie Perkins (00:18:51):
I think with a crazy big goal, the thing we have been really great at is achieving them. The timeframe that we achieve them on has not always been very reliable. We have certainly not been able to have pin dart. What's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:07):
Bullseye?

Melanie Perkins (00:19:08):
We have not been very accurate with timing, but it's really interesting. I look back at a 2021 vision deck that we made obviously in 2021, but it was about 2026 and it was fascinating to see how much we'd actually been able to achieve from that vision deck and how many things were currently still in flight. And so by having that, I thought in 2021, some of those things may have happened a little quicker, but over the last five years they've really been coming into reality. And so we might think things are going to take six months and they take a year. We might think things are going to take six months and they take two years. This has been the case. We might think something's actually going to take our entire lifetime as some of those really truly Crazy Big Goals. And in fact, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them frankly. But they're such an important goal that even if you make a little step in their direction, they're worthwhile nonetheless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
Whether you like him or not, Elon, this is similar to his, if you watch him, he sets these really ambitious goals and then often is far late on achieving them, but clearly it has worked out in achieving the crazy things that he's achieved. Something else I hear is you celebrate these goals in a really unique way. Talk about that.

Melanie Perkins (00:20:18):
So when we have these Crazy Big Goals, we also have couple them with really fun celebrations. And so we attempt to make the Crazy Big Goals happen in a moment in time. So then when we achieve them, we actually have a really fun moment because if you're just trying to plod towards the top of the mountain always and you never take a little moment to pat yourself on the back, it would feel a little arduous. And so over the years we had all sorts of fun little celebrations where we have smashed great plates and released doves and had a La Tomatina festival.

(00:20:51):
All sorts of fun things just to take a moment with the team to celebrate that huge achievement. And so I think that you want to celebrate what you want to really focus on and what you want everyone to take that moment. So when you achieve that crazy big goal when we launch in Spanish, when we hit a hundred languages and then the so forth across the company, taking that moment to actually pat yourself on the back and pat the teams on the back and say, "Hey, we did this thing. That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved." And the mission is often each of the different mission pillars, they're obviously a long area of investment that's going to take a long time to get to, but being able to celebrate each of the rungs on that on the way there I think is extraordinarily important. And then everyone works extraordinarily hard to bring them to life and then it gives everyone a little moment to feel proud of themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:43):
It'd be very motivating to get to just break a bunch of plates. I really like that. Celebration strategy.

Melanie Perkins (00:21:47):
We need to bring that one back. We haven't done that one in a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
That's a good one. I just love how concrete you're making this. So it's set these Crazy Big Goals, confine the component of the goals, set numbers there and then figure out the kind of steps you take to achieve these things. All fail is very easy. On the flip side of that, this is a segue. People hear these stories, they hear your story, they see Canva over the years and it's just this up into the right huge success story, one of the most successful companies in history. I imagine there have been many periods where things weren't going so great and when maybe things didn't look like they would work out. So let me just ask you this over the course of building Canva, once it started to click and started to feel like it was going to be a thing, was there a point where it started to again feel like, "Wow, maybe this may not work out. Maybe there's a huge setback that we may not get over?"

Melanie Perkins (00:22:35):
I think it's just a constant evolution. Every time the company doubles in size, pretty much all your systems break, all the things that were working don't work. A little example, in the early days we'd stand up and everyone would present their goals, what they're working on every day, every week. And then it kind of moved every month and then it was just taking too long because we've got so many people. And then it was sort of like we'd started doing these things called season openers and season openers were really fun where we got the entire company together, we talked about the goals that we'd achieved. And it was so funny because ahead of season openers, everyone would launch everything because they wanted to do it ahead of the season opener. And then we'd also set the goals for the coming cycle for the coming season at that point in time.

(00:23:17):
But then they started to become six hours long because we had so many people and so many teams. And so trying to find that right with the same philosophies of deep context for everyone with the same philosophies of the celebrations and the goals and trying to find that right flavor at every stage of scale is definitely hard. And so I think it's just a constant work in progress. Or back to your earlier point about timing of things, we were doing a front-end rewrite and we thought it would take about six months. It was really important because it was critical for cross-platform. It was critical for right to left. It was critical because we could only have five people working in our editor at any point in time because of the way the code base was structured and we thought it was going to take six months and then it took two years and it was two years of not shipping any product, two years of a product company not being able to ship product.

(00:24:14):
And that is such a core motivation for our team. He's shipping something, seeing great customer feedback and that kind of makes everyone feel happy and you've got momentum and it just felt like we're in a dark, dark tunnel that we could hardly see the end of the tunnel. And we didn't really know how long it was going to take because it just had to take as long as the tunnel was going to take. And it was a very hard time because other people would be launching this and that. And it was eventually we got out of that tunnel and it was extremely important that we did that work. We've now got two and a half thousand engineers and we're able to deliver amazing things that would've just been completely infeasible and simultaneous collaboration, so many things were baked into this. But yeah, it was not a fun period of time. A product company not shipping product is not really a recipe for fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):
For two years.

Melanie Perkins (00:25:16):
For two years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):
I feel like every builder listening to this knows exactly what you've been through and maybe not on that scale in those stakes, but you start on something, "Oh yeah, it'll take a few weeks," and then a year later you're still working on it.

Melanie Perkins (00:25:27):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
Just was the mood really, I don't know, sad internally? Two years, that's a long time not to ship anything. Just what was it like internally during that period?

Melanie Perkins (00:25:39):
I think it was kind of everything internally. We made it into a bit of a game. We had this game board and I bought these little rubber ducky sort of bath toys and we had, so we all the little components represented as a bath toy on this board and there was all these stages of went launched in product. There was an emergency lane at the end of it was home and hosed. And we did these weekly stand ups where everyone would come in and talk where their bath toy was at and just, we tried to make it fun for the team. So it was partly fun and it was partly distressing as all of our investors were like, "Hey, that thing." So I think it was both things at the same time. It was bonding let's say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):
Okay. Speaking of investors, speaking of other hard times, there's a very famous story about Canva. Early on you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you when you were just starting Canva. I think that's important. The investors than any founder I've talked to actually tries to pitch. It's impressive you tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet. Now you are something like a $40 billion company making 3.3 billion ARR. I think there's something like $240 million monthly active users, one of the hottest private companies in the world. Just how does this feel?

Melanie Perkins (00:27:06):
I don't know. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback often in the form of rejection. So they would say, "Oh, your market's not big enough." And I would say, "It's going to be huge." And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was. And then they'd say, "You're the same as some other company," coupled with rejection, and I would say, "Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill." Or most investors just knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we're in. And so we then ended up with the first few slides saying, "Here's the lay of the land today. Here's the problem that we're going to solve."

(00:27:53):
And so while it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our pitch deck stronger. And it was sort of from that chaos to clarity. At the start it was this idea and then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined. So then when people, the first time I remember I spoke to someone for hours and they eventually got it. They were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do, but then not everyone has six hours to understand a concept. And so being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood really clearly in a really short period of time and have all of the reasons that people were rejecting us pre-answered in that initial pitch deck was really important. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why when I look back at our 2012 pitch deck, it's so valid and really still captures what we're doing today. And so I think that rejection in some ways makes you stronger if you can persist through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
Well, I think beyond that, I've never heard this part of the story. It's not just persisting, it's actually iterating and taking feedback that you're hearing to continue to evolve the pitch to a place where, "Okay, I finally get what you're doing." That is such a cool part of the story. How much of that vision and product changed throughout that journey versus just the way you pitched it and convinced people?

Melanie Perkins (00:29:10):
It was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly. And so for example, I wouldn't, in the early days, articulate the problem very much. And I went into, "Here's the cool solution." And so then the first few pages became very much more problem-based because if people don't understand the problem then they can't understand or care about your solution. And so there was a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated, but the actual vision itself I think was pretty consistent through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):
Guessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started, having gone through so much rejection early on. What's your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising?

Melanie Perkins (00:29:48):
I mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of the dark tunnel analogy. Or chaos to clarity, let's go with that one. It's a slightly friendlier analogy and I think just taking the rejection and turning into things that you can control. So I can control my pitch deck, I can control the number of people I'm speaking to and I just spoke to literally everyone. And I think that continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection, I think it's really important to think how can I improve? How can I help someone to understand it? Some people are never going to understand it. I remember pitching an investor that had the lean startup book behind them when I was pitching them and they were never going to like Canva. We were not the lean startup. That was not the way that we were approaching it whatsoever. So there's some people that are just going to never like you and that's okay. I think it's important to find some people that do what you're trying to say and trying to do and kind of finding your tribe, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):
As an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva there that everyone's turning down, a hundred investors passed on, that you might still be able to invest in.

(00:30:58):
Talking about your growth as a leader, say if you compare Melanie of today to Melanie of, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago when you were just starting Canva, what would you say is most different in terms of leadership?

Melanie Perkins (00:31:11):
I don't really know. Probably if you ask other people around me, they'd probably be more observant. But it is funny because there's some things that I think that I need to change and then I realize you go into it the same as some other company. And sometimes we even try that for a while and then we try that out and we're like... It didn't really work for us. And it's kind of building a house that you want every brick in the house to match. And if you go and try and take some bricks from someone else's house and stick it in your house, it's probably going to not look very matched. And so trying to find things that are authentic to us and are authentic to everything that's come before it, is just that constant, constant thing. And then each scale of each stage of scale of the company rather than going, taking someone else's bricks and trying to stick that in your house, trying to build the thing that's authentic.

(00:31:59):
So I think there's many things that are the same, but obviously the stage and scale and we're constantly having to give away hats. And so you kind of think about it in the very early days. We just a few of us, two of us in Fusion and then three of us in a little tiny group, and you kind of wear a hundred hats and then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people that can then do that way better than yourself. And so I'm sure there's been a few skills I guess I would've had to have developed over the last decade to be able to give away those hats. But yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we've had to do and double down on that was more authentic to the way we did it in the early days actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:37):
I love that story. I think again, if anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth has experienced that when people from other companies come in and, "Here's how we did it at this company." Is there an example of some there that just like, "Here's something that this company brought in and people from this company thought we should do and we try it and didn't work?"

Melanie Perkins (00:32:54):
I won't go into specific examples, but so many times over. And I think that, I mean maybe that's probably, in answer your other question, we did things our way because that was the only way we knew. And there was many, many times over the years that we didn't have confidence in the way we were doing things and we were like, "Oh, they've done it from a big company that's bigger than our company. Let's go do that." And that hasn't always worked out so well for us. And so yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress. It feels like, as I was saying before, systems break and need to be reinvented but also reimagined for that next layer of scale rather than going to try to get something off the shelf from another company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
I imagine it also helped that you were in Australia away from the Bay Area and where all these other big companies are at, just being able to do it your own way.

Melanie Perkins (00:33:48):
Yeah, very much so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. JustWorks knows that your employees are more than just your employees, they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally to pay people on time and in their local currencies and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with JustWorks, it's super easy whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits or hiring internationally. JustWorks offer simple software and 24 7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources so that you can do right by your people, JustWorks, for your people.

(00:34:38):
Is there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different from how other companies operate? Anything else that comes to mind as a fun example?

Melanie Perkins (00:34:48):
The goal driven structure, I think the things that we were talking about before. So the mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing and then celebrating those goals when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply underloved way of building a company. Often people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere and then what they're actually doing and the way they actually make money and the way people actually spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original mission. And I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together and so you can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that actually are helping to achieve that. And I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you are actually doing the thing that you promised you do, and it all ladders up together. It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula, I think that there's a lot of authenticity with what you're saying you're doing, you're actually doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):
I want to come back to that. That's a whole really cool process. Do you have with closing the loop with customers, but something else I want to talk about while we're in this topic of growth over time. I saw you post something about how you had to realize they had to slow down and not just work, work, work like crazy. Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable.

Melanie Perkins (00:36:06):
So in the early days, I would just work seven days a week round the clock. In our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia. And in the early days of Canva, we certainly were working all weekend, all hours of the day. It was just constant. But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace, I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health or anything else. So I think finding ways to continue, I still work extraordinarily hard, but to continue to have that balance in my day to day where I actually go to sleep, I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling I find extraordinarily helpful to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:00):
It's easy to say that kind of stuff. It must be really hard to actually make time for that thing. Is there anything for those sorts of things, is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to actually do these things? Because as you said, there's a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly.

Melanie Perkins (00:37:15):
I feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years. I don't have emails on my phone and so when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out and then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page. But I think trying to delineate I think is really important. So when I'm working, I'm all in and then when I'm not working, I'm all out. And actually giving that mental space I think is really important. I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it. So when they're working every weekend it feels like the right thing, but then sometimes you can miss the forest from the trees when you're just working harder and harder, but maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing. And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective is actually really beneficial.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
I want to come back to this closing the loop process. Let's say that you have where you figure out what to build. A lot of your ideas come actually from the community. Talk about just that process and how many of your ideas actually came from your community.

Melanie Perkins (00:38:17):
Oh, it's one of my favorite things. We've been doing it for years now, and so we get more than a million requests from our community every year and we've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and then delivers them to all of our product teams and then those actually get closed. So this year we've closed more than 200 loops, but we know that each one of those things is going to be loved and needed by so many more people that don't bother to actually fill out the request form. So many things from gradient text, like little things like gradient text to really big things like our Sheets product. There's just been countless products. In the early days with our AI products, we didn't release them to teachers because we knew there was a lot of hesitancy for teachers using AI in the classroom.

(00:39:03):
And we got so many requests from teachers saying, "Can I please use this MagicWrite in the classroom?" And so with them we unlocked that and put on safety controls for teachers. And so it's just constant, actually. It's just part of our product process. I think there's two parts to product. One is building the future and towards the mission and the mission pillars as I was saying before. And the other is actually listening to our community and building what they want. And so I think that that's the two core pieces of product in my mind. And the closing the loop comes in so many different forms. There's the explicit asks, and then the other thing that we double down on all the time is user testing and watching people use it. And if people hesitate clicking a button or people don't quite understand how something works, it's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet and they can give such astute feedback that then is so representative for such a large number of people. I've personally run hundreds if not thousands of user tests myself and it's been deeply embedded in our product teams also.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
Wow, that must be really stressful for someone looking at a test of Canva, trying to try something when you're in the room.

Melanie Perkins (00:40:08):
It's actually, we do it all online actually. I mean the ones I've run are typically online. So people are so much more frank I think when it's just them and their camera and they don't really... Yeah, they tell you really how it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:24):
Is there a tool or a kind of a process there that you find really helpful? I don't know if you want to name names of products or anything like that, but it's something that you find helpful or useful.

Melanie Perkins (00:40:31):
Yeah, we use a lot of UserTesting.com, find that super valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
All right, go user testing. Okay. Something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to Canva is something that's called the two-step plan. You mentioned this earlier, I want to definitely talk about this. What is the two-step plan? Why is this so important to you?

Melanie Perkins (00:40:50):
Yeah, so when you were asking about Crazy Big Goals, I think this is our most macro, most crazy biggest goal. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two, do the most good we can do. And in our early days I thought I'd do step one and then step two and realize that actually step one can fuel step two and step two can fuel step one. And so that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now. In the early days we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program. Every single person, every single company should take that where you give 1% of time, money, equity and profitability. And I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that then can compound greatly over time. We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it.

(00:41:35):
So Cliff and I owned a little over 30% of Canva, and so we decided we were going to take 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do. And we are doing that. So we're doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation. We've just, over the last few years, we've donated $50 million to GiveDirectly, where they give money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty and then they can use that money on their family to go to school, to get healthcare, to start small businesses, to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet. Just real truly basic human needs things. And we've just announced that we're going to be giving another a hundred million dollars over the next four years to people in extreme poverty. And it's just like when you go and sit with people and you hear about how they're spending, what's very microscopic amount at $550 doesn't buy us that much, but it's a life-changing amount of money for people in extreme poverty and it's truly transformational what it can do.

(00:42:39):
And you meet people and you hear their stories and it's truly the best money I could ever imagine spending. And that crazy big dream I was mentioning earlier of everyone having basic human needs met, it's so completely insane that isn't the case today. There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet, but we just haven't got to act together as humanity. And so that is a truly crazy, big dream. But back to the two-step plan. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two do the most good we can do. And finding ways to do that at the same time I think is extraordinarily important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):
That's incredible. It makes me think about, not to mention Elon again, but Elon's three-step strategy plan and it's like build better cars versus this is like, "Okay, solve all the problems of the world and make the world a better place." What a better master plan to compare. Something else about this that I love is a lot of companies have this, have something philanthropic going on with the company and it's like sitting in a doc on some page. It's part of their mission. It's not actually that big of a deal to them. What I hear from folks at Canva is something you talk about all the time. This is an actually core part of how you work and think and how you set goals and set vision and missions.

Melanie Perkins (00:43:53):
Yeah, I'm happy to hear that. I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world. For me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever. It's a means to an end and I've been very blessed to be able to do some work and that creates wealth that can then go and have people's basic human needs met. But they're working just as hard, but they don't have the opportunity. And even our education product, it's now used by a hundred million people each month and we are in most school districts and rolled out across countries and being able to bring quality education tools to every, and we give that away for free as well. Being able to help empower schools all around the world and we're going to be doubling down and doubling down into that product to bring quality education to all. I think it gives so much more meaning behind work. We've also, between our education product and our non-profit program where we also give away our paid product for free, we are giving away 1.5 billion of product a year now. And so the impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that I think is pretty great. And I think for all of us, it gives a lot more meaning to our work than, "Get Rich."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
Okay. So speaking of product, coming back to that, you guys are launching something, maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out, what I heard described as the biggest launching canvas history, no big deal, that's a high bar. Considering all the things you guys have launched, what are you launching? Why is it such a big deal?

Melanie Perkins (00:45:24):
We are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching. I guess the whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design. And so what has been enabled by new technology with all of AI has been just really profound. Enabling people to take their idea and turn it into design a design and have as little friction between those two points. So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bring some incredible capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform. We are launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features from enterprise customers around the world and business customers around the world who want to be able to design with Canva's drag and drop ease and to be able to create an email. We are launching forms, we are launching, probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're embedding AI across the entire product suite.

(00:46:12):
And so you can actually use AI to design a presentation, a video, a email, a website. All of these things can actually now be done inside the core editor, inside the design tab, which is used by 170. It's used 170 million times a month. And then on our elements tab, which is used 900 million times a month, we are also embedding AI. So you can actually generate a video, you can generate a canvas code and you can generate photos all directly inside that platform. And then we're also launching comments as lots of our customers use Canvas to comment and collaborate. And now you can actually just tag at Canvas and you can collaborate. You can just say, "Hey, can you make this title shorter? Can you do this? Can you do that?" And it has all of the context of the design so in situ, you can actually just have a collaborator that can help get your work done. So we are pretty excited about all of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):
Amazing. Something I'm going to just let people know, I don't know if people know all this, how many products you all have now. I think a lot of people think of Canva as a design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, code, AI coding tool. And now what I'm hearing is email forums. There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking [inaudible 00:47:36]-

Melanie Perkins (00:47:35):
Yeah, truly design anything. We're literally living up to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
Oh my god, it's happening.

Melanie Perkins (00:47:38):
100 million people design a presentation in Canva each month now and it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet some time ago. They were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google. Gen Z, the way they design a presentation is in Canva, but it's not just generational for those with other generational ilk, but it is been fascinating to see that come to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):
The email product, is that like a email client product or It's a design emails that you can then send through your products?

Melanie Perkins (00:48:17):
It is design emails, so you can design email, then you can take that code and you can pop it into any email platform that you use.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:24):
How do you think about products you're going to expand to, I know there's trade secrets here. You don't want to tell everyone where you're going next, but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next.

Melanie Perkins (00:48:31):
So our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally. So to literally design anything, to literally publish anywhere. And so we now print in 50 something countries around the world and you can get it printed and delivered to your house. And we plant it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
I actually did that, while you're on it.

Melanie Perkins (00:48:55):
Oh, awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):
I wasn't planning this, but I had a print thing delivered to my house. It's so cool.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:02):
Oh, yeah. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
We have to go to a print shop in this freaking graphic and well here's a button. Let's click that.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:07):
Exactly. Just click print and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
I don't know how that works. Yeah, I don't know how you did that, but it worked. How cool.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:14):
But it's very cool. And so yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life. Oh, we're like launching 3D as well. So all of these things we will be bringing to life literally. And just picking off what is the most strategically important next thing to enable everyone to design anything, to enable everyone to publish anywhere. And we have been doing that for a decade and we'll continue to do that forever more using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):
Okay, so this is helpful. So if someone's like, "Oh, will Canva come for my space?" Are people designing thing that was design and also, what was it? Publish?

Melanie Perkins (00:49:49):
Publishing anywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:50):
Okay. Publishing and designing. Okay. So if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out.

Melanie Perkins (00:49:57):
From a macro perspective, there was creativity tools and productivity tools. And what Canva really does is we're literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity, rather than making our customers have to make a choice between those two suites.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Something I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds. There's always this Figma and Adobe and then there's Canva and there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this. One is just at the beginning of the journey where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge and their specific niche. Just how did you think about that? "Here's how we might have a chance to..." I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think. Just how did you approach your early wedge of users?

Melanie Perkins (00:50:38):
One of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill, and what can we solve a problem, a core problem that people currently have today? And so with our first company that was yearbooks in Australia and there wasn't great tools and these yearbook coordinators got thrown in to have to design something and they'd have no design experience. And we spoke to every single customer. We gave them an over the phone tutorial, we understood all of their pain points, we got continuous customer feedback, and then we tried to iterate and improve.

(00:51:12):
And then when we were thinking about Canva, a few years into that, actually one of the schools said, "I love this product so much. Can I use it to design newsletters?" And they had all sorts of other things that they wanted to use it for, and we kind of looked around and were like, "Oh, there's still nothing on the market." This was a few years into it, that actually does the thing that we're doing, but for all these other things. And so it was much more like where is the gap in the market that people are currently having a pain point? And if you can solve that pain point really well and solve it in such a way that people actually want to pay for it because it is truly solving a real pain point that they have, I think that kind of sets it up for success rather than be a problem or a solution looking for a problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:53):
So what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink, "Here's my CP, here's the wedge and the strategy of how we expand into this large thing." It's like, "Here's people with a problem that hasn't been solved in years that we keep seeing. Let's try to solve it."

Melanie Perkins (00:52:04):
Exactly that. And if you take that problem centered approach that helps people to achieve something they actually want to do in the real life, you're probably going to be at a reasonably good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. That's a particularly great thing. If it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if a few people have that same problem... But I think that again, back to that big ladder and that first rung, I think it's better to solve a small number of people's problem really well than trying to solve a large number of people's problem. Not very well at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
Something I can't not ask about is just how you think about AI in your product. You mentioned how you integrated or all through the product, just you guys are doing really good stuff with AI. A lot of companies are struggling to find something really that works great. Do you have just a philosophy of, "Here's how we integrate AI into Canva," where it ends up being really helpful and people love it?

Melanie Perkins (00:52:56):
Your question is actually the answer at the same time. I think being able to integrate it into the product where it actually helps people to get their work done where it genuinely helps them to achieve their goals, and then being really open to listening to your community and hearing what they're loving, what they're struggling with and refining from there I think is really, really important. Just because AI is all the rage and investors really like AI doesn't necessarily mean it should be front and center, but if it can genuinely help your customers to achieve their goals. So the thing that I was mentioning before, enabling people to communicate their ideas and have little friction between those two points, AI is just kind of naturally a very critical part of that equation for us. In fact, it was funny looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing because it really was critical to what we were trying to do even in our 2012 deck. You can kind of imagine how AI very much fit into the equation because of exactly what we're trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question: what's a way you've found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?

Melanie Perkins (00:54:11):
So many things. So AI is often the first. If I'm having an idea, it'll be a first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, "Give me more ideas of this," and it's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow. Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk and it's when I just put my ear pods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything on my mind and I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things I need to action. And it kind of helps again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email. It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point I find. So yeah, so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:01):
For the Voice Note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:04):
Yeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs, and then I actually just do the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just summarize them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):
Got it. And so you just use native microphone-

Melanie Perkins (00:55:19):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:19):
... dictation sort of thing. Nothing fancy?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
Okay.

Melanie Perkins (00:55:21):
Yeah, I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):
This reminded me of, you mentioned earlier in our conversation you had this vision board that you said is for 2050. Is that right?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:30):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
Can you share something from that vision board?

Melanie Perkins (00:55:35):
I'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months. I did feel like as humanity, we are on a bit of a freight train and that freight training is, I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening and you just fast-forward 50 years or you do 2050 and you say, "Are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want?" I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons. And so I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls and back to the chaos to clarity.

(00:56:22):
The first thing was riding my 2050 wall and I've really been loving, I've got a whole on the 2050 wall, started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes were along those similar lines. And then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have basic human needs for all global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences all the really important things that we want as humanity. And again, using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. And I find it really fascinating in my day-to-day by literally having it beside me as I work every day, the little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want and can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know.

(00:57:24):
But I feel like just by starting to write it down some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people and starting to just etch out, how do we get closer and closer to that. On my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals. And then us actually rising to that occasion in the world. We don't want, I think loneliness is rife, purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bound to fall. We all have deep purpose. And that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. Something that we're doing at our Canva world to a keynote in two weeks time, which I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime?

(00:58:25):
And then people literally writing it down I think is pretty powerful. And then people sharing that with other people I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn? That reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence, I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? And I think that's where we'll get purpose from and I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards something bigger than yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):
Wow. I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started. I would not be at all surprised that this actually happens and that you achieve this very difficult vision.

Melanie Perkins (00:59:18):
It's not something that I alone can achieve. I think it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that. I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things. I genuinely think we need to move course a little and decide not what are all the things that we... what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? What the hell? It just literally makes no sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:03):
A column B world, you might say.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:06):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:07):
Melanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:17):
You have been extremely extensive. I don't think I've got anything else to add, frankly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:20):
That's the goal. That's the goal. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melanie, are you ready?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:25):
Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Melanie Perkins (01:00:31):
One of the books I love is The Power of Moments, and it talks, am I supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
It's all good.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:39):
Okay. Two books, the Power of Moments, and one of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):
I like they shifted to fast mode. You don't have to go superfast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Not Canva.

Melanie Perkins (01:00:56):
I love the Calm app. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):
Okay. First question. I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy and have so much going on. So I'm going to try it, new question I haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. So excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing other company like, "Oh, I wish I could work on that thing," or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:27):
I feel like my Canva chapter's going to go on for a long time, so I don't know, because we've got-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):
On the side, on the side.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:33):
... decent plans side and we're pretty extensive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):
Okay, maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go.

Melanie Perkins (01:01:36):
I feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. And so the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts all boats I think is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Maybe along those lines, but maybe not, is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to and work your own life?

Melanie Perkins (01:02:28):
There's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a constant aspiration. And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination. That imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. And in fact, everything great that we experience in life was first imagined.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:00):
Wow. There's so much power to that one thought nugget there is just, there's all these tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. "What do I want?" I don't even don't know what I need. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school, you had to wake up at 4:30 A.M. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva?

Melanie Perkins (01:03:36):
So many things are quite directly applicable, falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, it was quite literal in my figure skating in days, and maybe it was a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:57):
You're right. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. Two final questions: where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you feedback on Canvas or join Canva, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Melanie Perkins (01:04:12):
Really great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva World Tour through October, which is probably going to be updated when this is posted.

(01:04:43):
Come to our events. We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products and in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And every decision that you make for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:27):
I have to ask before I let you go. Are you going to have the rap dancers at the next Canva event?

Melanie Perkins (01:05:33):
You'll have to wait and see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:34):
Okay. Melanie, thank you so much for being here.

Melanie Perkins (01:05:38):
Thank you so much, Lenny, for having me and your great well-researched questions.

## Transcript

Melissa Perri (00:00):
I've met a lot of organizations that think most of their issues are in the training of their people. And 99% of the time I see that it's actually in the way that they're setting their goals and deploying their strategy. Because once you train those people, they have no context on what to work towards. So it's such a holistic approach when you actually go through these transformations, or try to set up a product organization, so you either need somebody in there to do it, or you've got to really be ready to move when somebody comes in to help you.

Lenny (00:31):
Through her speaking, consulting, interim CPO roles, and teaching at both Harvard Business School and online, Melissa Perri has seen more product orgs up close then possibly any human alive. In our chat, we cover the most common problems that product teams face, and how to overcome them, when to hire your first PM, how to hone your craft as a PM, signs you're doing a bad job as a PM, also how to structure your product teams and product development process, signs your team doesn't have a strategy and how to come up with one, also how to come up with a product vision, and so much more.

(01:05):
I loved chatting with Melissa, and I learned a ton. And I can't wait for you to hear this episode.

(03:00):
Melissa, welcome. Thank you so much for joining me.

Melissa Perri (03:03):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny (03:04):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I wanted to set a little context for folks that may not be familiar with you. How many PMs have you worked with and helped, would you say, over the course of your career?

Melissa Perri (03:17):
Between teaching, consulting, and all of those different things, it's probably north of 4,000 at this point. I think we're approaching 5,000 now.

Lenny (03:28):
Oh my God. Okay. And then, how many companies would you say you've worked with?

Melissa Perri (03:35):
If we're talking deep consulting since I started Produx Labs, we've done over 30 companies where we've been in there, did something with them, either transformation-wise or setting up their PM work or setting their strategy, helping with roadmaps. If we're talking training, we're into the multiple hundreds.

Lenny (03:54):
Okay. Insane. Would you say that you're maybe in the top three, maybe top five people in the world that have worked with the most product managers, or have even met the most product managers?

Melissa Perri (04:04):
I know a lot of people who do what I do, so I think probably among them. Probably among them. But I haven't counted everybody else's.

Lenny (04:13):
Okay. For all these reasons, I'm really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that you've learned along this journey, and things that people can take away from your experience. What do you spend your time doing these days? I know there's a lot in your portfolio.

Melissa Perri (04:25):
Well, right now I would say my primary focus is on training in education in product management. So, I'm teaching at Harvard. I teach the second year MBAs in their elective program, product management, so they can choose whether or not they want to take that. But that's been really great. And then, I have had an online school since 2016 called Product Institute. So it's all a self-serve, online education place where we have multiple courses in product management.

(04:51):
We have trained almost all of the Fortune 100 companies at this point through that with product management, which is great. But a lot of different growth stage companies coming in there too, and smaller companies as well. Been doing that for quite some time.

(05:04):
And then, I more recently started CPO Accelerator, which is a program to help VPs and heads of product really make the leap into the C suite. So that's been really great because I believe that the more we train people to be better product executives, the better products they'll make, and the better product managers they'll make by training them as well.

(05:25):
That's been my primary focus. I am writing another book called Product Operations. After writing Escaping The Build Trap, I thought I would never write again, but it's time.

Lenny (05:33):
I know the feeling.

Melissa Perri (05:35):
So I'm excited about that. I'm writing it with my former VP of product at Products Labs, Denise. Before I was doing what I'm doing right now, I was doing all of that, plus I was also consulting pretty deeply with companies through Produx Labs. But at the end of 2020, I took a step back from that to take a little break from it, focus more the teaching aspects of things, and try to figure out what else I'm going to do from here.

Lenny (05:59):
I love that you mentioned your book. You almost didn't, and I was going to make sure to mention it. And we're going to talk about it more in a little bit. And I have it right here. And hopefully I can get it signed someday in real life.

(06:11):
Before we get into that, you've worked with dozens of companies directly, hundreds, maybe, indirectly through the course, and then, like you said, thousands of PMs. When you come into a company, they basically bring you in to help them level up their product team, their product management function. What are two of the most common problems that you run into, or even unexpected problems you run into? Especially at modern tech companies, not Ford and things like that. No offense. What do you run into usually?

Melissa Perri (06:44):
In 2014, I started consulting with companies through Produx Labs. And it's funny because some people will be like, oh, well you've never worked with... I get two sides of it. I'll get the, well, you don't really work with the SaaS companies, but I had a whole partnership with Insight Venture Partners, where we'd go in and play the interim CPO role in their high-growth SaaS companies. We'd help them scale, we'd set their strategy and their roadmaps and all that stuff. So we did that for a long time.

(07:07):
And then, I have also come in and helped organizations that aren't really SaaS, like banks, a lot of banks. A lot, a lot of banks. But your pharmaceutical companies, and all these other ones too, kind of set up product management for the first time. So I've seen the whole gamut, from super software-focused teams to companies that are still just figuring out software. And it's been great because some of the companies I've worked with now, since 2014, I've been able to see eight years of their progressions and what they go through with that.

(07:41):
And I'd say it's very different if you're SaaS versus non-SaaS. But if we're talking about the SaaS companies that get software, software is what they sell, software is a critical part of their strategy, they're bought in, they know that it's really important, one of the issues I see with them and product management is, at this pivotal scale up phase, where they go from, hey, I found product market fit, to I'm ready to scale, one, it's hiring a great chief product officer that can help them figure out what the next phase is. So it's basically there is this junction point where they go from single product to multiproduct, but then they have to manage a complex portfolio and then they have to scale rapidly. At that point, they have to rethink their entire strategy. And then they have to focus because they have all of these choices to keep building for their existing customers and just take everything off the backlog because everybody's requesting things, they really have to focus and prioritize.

(08:36):
And that becomes absolutely critical, but it's usually the first time that company has actually had to form a comprehensive strategy and a prioritized strategy, and deploy it to hundreds of employees, which will scale to thousands of employees. And that is hard. It's not easy to do. And if you've never done it before, which a lot of people haven't in that position, that becomes really complicated.

(09:00):
And then there's some companies, too, that bypass that initial growth phase, because they already could clearly see what their second and third product should be, and they were scaling really fast, and it's awesome, and they're really, really successful. But then they start to plateau. And they have the same problem, where they have to rethink, reprioritize. And it just always comes back to how do I set strategy, how do I deploy strategy, and how do I make sure it's well communicated and that everything that we're doing on the tech teams, on the product teams, is laddered up into a company strategy that's well prioritized.

(09:33):
But that has to be the biggest issue that I see with companies at all. They get the software piece, they know it's a critical part of their business, it's just, how do we prioritize it and double down?

Lenny (09:44):
And build the org and find the right people to build it all out. I'd love to double-click on that. What is a sign that it's time for a CPO, and then what do you look for when you're hiring a CPO? I know these are big questions, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Melissa Perri (09:57):
Usually, whoever was the product leader, whether it was the founder or maybe somebody who was a little bit more junior. In those phases at the beginning, finding product market fit, trying to get into the growth stage, early growth stage, it's really about execution at that point. It's rapidly experimentation, trying to figure that out. And all hands on deck, you're usually a little bit in the weeds as well, doing the work yourself, too.

(10:18):
And then, when you get into needing a CPO, it's like, hey, we actually have to pull together a product strategy that's all encompassing. We have to have great communication between product and the executive team. A big sign for me, when I've come in and worked with boards or executive teams as well, is they're telling me, I don't really know what's going on in tech or product. I have no idea if we're achieving our goals.

(10:42):
If your executives and your board are telling you that, the person who's communicating those things to them are usually not chief product officer level. If your executives don't know what you're doing, that's a big problem. So that's usually the sign, to me, that we need that.

(11:00):
When I was going in and consulting pretty deeply, the first thing I would do is go to all the teams... if there was 5,000 teams, a smattering of teams. But I'd always ask them, what are you working on? What's the most important thing you could be doing, and why? And I would try to ladder that up myself into a strategy and see if it was connected. And if it wasn't connected, that's telling me somebody's not formulating the strategy and deploying it down. And then, that's telling me there is a lack of strategy at the top. And that would be like, hey, is there a CPO here? And if there is, maybe this person isn't right for the job. Or there's no CPO, and we do need somebody around this to actually formulate the strategy.

(11:40):
On an org design perspective with the team, I'd look at the product managers. If the product managers aren't... Sometimes you have great product managers, and they're frustrated because they're not getting the direction they need. And you can tell they're great product managers. They know what they're doing, they're in there, showing me there's a lack of leadership there. If there's trouble hiring product managers, that's a good sign that you need a CPO, you need somebody they can learn from and give them those opportunities. And if there's a lot of junior product managers who've never done it before, it's like, what's their training path? Is there something in there? Is there a process implemented where everybody can follow it? Is there a way for them to learn? If those things are lacking, it's telling me there's a gap in leadership on the product level.

Lenny (12:23):
Awesome. That is really helpful. Is there a number of PMs that it usually ends up being, of how many PMs you have when it's time to maybe hire a CPO?

Melissa Perri (12:31):
It really differs. I'd say the critical junction points I've found deal more with company strategy. We used to talk about this a lot at Insight, but it's like if you're going above $10 million in ARR, it's usually when you hit around 20 to 30, you start to bring on a CPO in a high-growth company. What the product starts to look like is you have multi-products, so you have more than two or more. Sometimes you can have a VP of product over two, that's totally fine, but as soon as you start to think about expanding into a more complex portfolio after that, I'd look for probably a CPO. If you're expanding geographically, if you're going into new markets, drastically new markets... The more complex your portfolio, the bigger the sign is that you need a CPO. If you're doing a major transformation or pivot, if you're doing a huge merger of two companies, you're probably going to need a CPO of those two things. So those types of events usually lead to, if you don't have a CPO, it's time to get one.

(13:28):
The number of product managers, I'd probably say it starts to hit around maybe eight, seven to eight is usually what I'd look for. But it depends on what the rest of the team looks like, too. A lot of times, chief product officers, especially in a high-growth company, are not going to be over just product. We'd have product reporting into them, design, some kind of product operations, sometimes analytics, depending on what company it is. And then, even in certain cases, I've put engineering underneath a CPO when there hasn't been really strong engineering leadership, and you need to have product leading tech. And maybe there's a disconnect there, and you don't have time. You need one leader. You need to simplify it and go.

(14:11):
So depending on the scope that somebody is covering as well, if they're only seeing product, and there's no opportunity for them to be over design or something else, we would probably stick with a VP of product. But if you need a singular leader to bring all those things together, that's where I would start looking for a chief product officer, too.

Lenny (14:28):
What do you suggest companies do up until that point? I know titles are not necessarily consistent. I imagine usually there's a head of product before that point. Is that what you'd recommend? What should you do up until you get to a point where it's time for a CPO?

Melissa Perri (14:41):
Head of product or VP of product, I think, are very interchangeable, in my head. What a VP of product or a head of product is, is a functional leader around product management. Sometimes you have design reporting into them, sometimes not. But they're very good at implementing processes so that product works smoothly. They can pull together the roadmap across all other product managers. They can usually train lower level people.

(15:03):
Where the gaps come between that and becoming an executive is interfacing with the board, understanding the financials super deeply so that you can create revenue projections off of what your roadmaps and your product's strategy is going to be. So chief product officers have to deeply understand how to get from roadmap to revenue and how to analyze those things and put it into perspective. So they're usually joined at the hip with the chief revenue officer, or the head of sales, the CFO. They can confidently project to the board. They're a fantastic executive navigator when it comes to dealing with other executives and bringing those things together. And they can oversee a lot more functions than just product, usually. Everything can kind of... They're a senior enough person where you can have a couple different functional lines report into them with a head of design, head of product reporting up.

(15:53):
So VPs of product are usually fantastic at growing one or two products. But then, when you get into multiproduct strategies, or very complex platform strategies, and the scope starts to really creep, that's where I would start to bring in a CPO.

Lenny (16:12):
I was going to ask you about what to look for in a CPO, and you answered it. So, amazing. Real quick, before you move on to the scale of product management and some thoughts there, when would it make sense for a company to consider bringing in someone like you to do either interim CPO role or just to help out?

Melissa Perri (16:28):
Yeah. I hope you never need me. That's my goal with everything I do. I'm always like, I would love to put myself out of business one day because I just want this to work really well. But where I am needed is usually when a CEO isn't sure who is the right person to hire. They're usually on the fence. I've come into organizations to help CEOs where they're like, do we need a product person to oversee this? I don't know what a product person does. And I usually talk them through like, hey, what are the challenges you're having? And they tell me everything, and I'm like, okay, these ones are actually caused by you not having that partner to work with. If you had that partner, this is what they could take off your plate and free you up to focus on your vision, and fundraising, and all the other stuff that you have to do as a CEO.

(17:20):
So typically, that's where I'd come in to advise. And when I came in in consulting in the past, my motto was always... Well, first I will say I spent a long time doing transformational work, where I would deeply embed and try to push org design, and deploying strategy, and really taking these organizations that didn't understand product management and helping them design how to do it. So I did that for quite a while. And then, when I started working with growth stage companies, my objective was, how do I get in and get out as fast as possible, and bring them in the right leaders?

(17:56):
So what I learned, being deeply embedded with these organizations doing this transformation work, was somebody needs to be at the helm of all of this work consistently. And they also have to be able to make the decisions, as well. So you can hire a consultant, but if you don't listen to the consultant, nothing's going to change. And that does happen more often than you think, where everybody just hires and they're like, no, not that way, and you're like, okay, well, it's up to you at the end of the day. I can't change it for you.

(18:26):
I've also had people hire me as a consultant and be like, well, no, you change it. And I'm like, I can't. You can't just tell me to do your job. You have to go out there and do it yourself. But I will give you all the informed choices and try to design it to meet your needs. And sometimes it's not coming out super ideal and perfect, but it's all a transition. We make roadmaps for transformations.

(18:47):
But, being deeply embedded like this, I was starting to think, how do I make sure that this lasts? And that's where I believe strong product leadership comes in. Whether you train somebody up in the organization to take that role over and keep driving it forward, or you hire in somebody who knows what they're doing.

(19:04):
So when I started working with Insight, our premise was, we will never touch a company, or be in a company hands-on, for more than three months. The idea was, within that three months, we hire in a chief product Officer to take the helm, and we do just enough to keep it on track, playing an interim CPO role, to make sure that they can keep delivering, they can keep growing. We'd have just enough of a roadmap to keep the teams moving. We train them a little bit, we'd help implement some processes. We'd help get all the information a CPO would need so that when they walked into that organization, they could read the background on their customers, understand what the strategy is so far, look at the current roadmap, watch some customer interviews, know who to talk to, get the lay of the land and have some people working on stuff. And then they could take the time they need to actually build a strategy that's going to help grow the company.

(19:57):
So really, at the end of the day, when you need some help, you realize something is not working but you're not sure how to make it right. And then, you can either hire in a leader... Sometimes the question is what kind of leader. That's when you try to hire consulting, get some outside expertise on that. Or, if you want to hire an interim CPO type person, you have to understand that's very temporary, unless you're trying to convert that person into a full-time, which is totally fine if you want to do that and have those expectations going in. But consultants can only help as well when you're willing to take action.

(20:25):
So I tell some companies as well at the beginning, you're not ready for this unless you are ready to take action. And sometimes that's drastic change. Sometimes that's changing up people. Sometimes you look at your organization and say, this isn't the organization that's going to get me to the next level, so we're going to have to make some changes, we're going to have to hire in some more senior people as well who can help train the masses of other people that need training. We're going to have to make some hard decisions, and you have to reevaluate your strategy a lot of the times, and figure out how to set course with that too.

(20:57):
I've met a lot of organizations that think most of their issues are in the training of their people. And 99% of the time, I see that it's actually in the way that they're setting their goals and deploying their strategy. Because once you train those people, they have no context on what to work towards.

(21:15):
So it's such a holistic approach when you actually go through these transformations, or try to set up a product organization. So you either need somebody in there to do it, or you've got to really be ready to move when somebody comes in to help you.

Lenny (21:26):
I was going to save these questions for later, but it's as good a time as any to get into them around strategy, which your book is about, I would say, is the fact that people just build features, features, features, and don't really have a strategy or aren't using a strategy. And so, just spending a little time there, what are signs that your team or your company either doesn't have a strategy or aren't using their strategy?

Melissa Perri (21:51):
Yeah, that's a fair question. Signs that there are no strategy, teams are all working like dogs. They're working 80 hours a week. I see this all the time. People are heads down, crunching, crunching, crunching, releasing, releasing, releasing. Or sometimes not releasing, but they're working like crazy and none of the metrics are moving. So the executive team is going, what is happening? Product is a black box. Tech is a black box. We've got all these people. What do they do all day? A great example of when there is no strategy.

(22:23):
And what usually is happening is there's this missing middle. It's like, we all know exactly what each team... We don't all know, actually, what each team is working on. The teams all know exactly what they're working on, which is usually some kind of feature enhancement, new features, whatever you've got. Bug fixes, all that wonderful stuff. The people they report to usually know what the teams are doing, but the executives are like, cool, how does that matter to our business? How does that actually ladder up into our vision, where we want to go, our objectives for the year, our goals? Great sign that there is actually no strategy deployed correctly.

(22:59):
Now, when I say, too, there's no strategy, there's usually some kind of strategy, but it lives in people's heads, and they're really bad about writing it down and getting it out. So I always tell people, too, if you think that there's no strategy, go interrogate people for awhile. Go talk to the leaders. Is this good if we hit these numbers? Is this bad? Why? If I release this thing, what do you think will happen? What numbers will change? What behaviors will change? How will this make us better? I usually can pull out what people believe the goals to be, and sometimes they're just not explicitly written down.

(23:34):
So that's an exercise that I typically do, too, when I don't see strategy well-manifested in these organizations. I just go in and I say, okay, what does good look like for you? Where is the vision and where are we going? And I ask all of these questions, too, to a lot of people. And you find that there's different answers across the organization, and that shows a lack of alignment on a complete strategy, as well.

(23:57):
I once asked all the executive team at a healthcare company, what's the vision for this company? And they said, to be the backbone of healthcare. And I said, what does that mean? And they couldn't elaborate. Nobody could elaborate on that. And I said, cool, that's a tagline, but it's not a vision. What are we manifesting into? What are we doing? What are we not doing? Who do we want to be when we grow up? Five to ten years from now, how are we different than we are today? Those things, more often than not, are not written down, and they're not clearly communicated.

(24:28):
So one of the exercises we do is we write. If I see that there's no strategy, I have CEOs write two-pagers on where did the company come from? How is it different today? What are our external treats to our market? What's our competition? How do you view our competition? What should we care about? What should we not care about? What are we going to do? What are we not going to do? And then prioritize their strategic intents, or what I call them, which are really big business movers, for the next two, three years. So it's like, are we going to go up market? Are we going to go down market? Are we going to expand geographically? Are we going to innovate into a completely new market or a new opportunity?

(25:13):
Those types of things need to be clearly prioritized at the top, and then we can start to make the product portfolio at the bottom. And when there's a missing strategy piece... I call it the missing middle is usually gone, which connects those strategic intents and those business outcomes back into what the teams are actually doing. So it's like, great, that team is building a widget for sales people to do cold emails. Why? How is that going to move us into what we want to do for our vision? Is it retaining people because we have a problem with our current market? Is it allowing us to enter a new market if we put it together?

(25:51):
But if we think about all the things that teams do in isolation, it's not enough, usually, to move those business metrics. So what people do in a lack of strategy is they spread the team too thin across tons of initiatives. One team usually isn't enough to get some really hard hitting metrics out there. And then, you don't see the progress that you're actually looking to see as an executive.

Lenny (26:16):
If a feature ships but no one knows about it, did it really ship? Keeping customers and internal teams like sales support and marketing in the loop on what's changing across your product is surprisingly hard. First, you have to dig through tickets and poll requests just to see what's been done. Then, you have to figure out what's relevant to each person, craft updates, and then share them across all of your channels. Multiply this by the number of things that ship every week, and that's basically a full-time job just to keep everyone updated on what's changing.

(26:44):
That's why high velocity product teams like Monte Carlo, Armory, and Popsicle use Makelog. Makelog makes it easy to see what's happening across tools like [inaudible 00:26:54], Linear, Assan, and GitHub, and then to write bite-sized updates, which you can immediately share with your audience, wherever they are, including within your app, on Slack, over email, and even on Twitter. No more long, boring, blog-style change log posts that slow you down. Just quick and easy updates that keep your users informed and happy.

(27:20):
So you're a PM on a team, or even just a leader of a company, and you're like, hmm, I think we might have a strategy, maybe we don't. I'm hearing things that are true at our company, and I'm worried. What does it look like for me to have a strategy? You named a few things that you should probably have, a vision, intents and actions, and things like that. What's the checklist of, oh, if I have this, this, this, that, we probably have a strategy in place, at least?

Melissa Perri (27:48):
A good test is you go to all of your teams, and you ask them what they're doing and why, exactly what I was talking about before. And they all tell a similar story. We're working on X, Y, and Z because it goes into this initiative, and it causes this type of value for these customers, which, in return, is going to get us this business value and help us enter these new markets. They can connect everything they're doing, from the tactical stuff on the team, all the way back up to the business metrics.

(28:14):
And if you deploy your strategy well, your product teams will deeply understand how their stuff actually impacts the business. And if you don't deploy it well, they're going to be like, I don't know why I'm building this stuff. If you have a bunch of people asking you, why are we building this, then you didn't do a good job as a leader explaining what it is that you're after. So everybody should be telling the same story.

(28:39):
Another amazing sign when this is all done really well, too, that I love, is there's usually way less infighting across stakeholders and executives. One of the biggest issues I see in organizations is when executives all have different goals, and they're not aligned on the same goals for the company. So it's like, sales teams over here are like, no, our goal is new logos. And you're like, cool, but in what markets, and how is that prioritized against what we're building from our product roadmap, and why is this not in sync?

(29:13):
And I've seen really bad CEOs pit their executives against each other with different goals, so they don't see each other as one team. And the executive team should be one team. And the best teams I've ever seen, the most successful companies I've ever seen, everybody works together, and they're like, these are our goals, and these are our business goals.

(29:32):
So when strategy is deployed correctly and you have that type of culture, too, with your executives, they're all on the same page. So you can have very calm trade-off talks about, are we going to do strategic intent one or two? If we do this, then we don't get that. Are we okay with that? And it's not emotional, it's more objective, because we're all there together to further the business.

(29:57):
And a lot of times, we complain, as product managers, about stakeholders all asking for different things, and that's always going to be the case. There's always going to be a little bit of that. But you typically will get less of that on the team two, because the priorities within each part of the business should be aligned to the overall priorities. And it will be easier to manage, and it's easier to push back on why we're not doing one thing over the other thing, because we all know what our goals are, we all know what the company priorities are, and we can see why one thing versus the other won't work.

Lenny (30:30):
So you have these conversations, which make so much sense. Just talk it out, see if everyone's on the same page about your goals, how you think you're going to get to that goal. What do you do with that? Do you usually recommend people throw it into a Google doc that everybody sits there and just confirms as happy, and is there a template that you share with people, like, here's what we're going to fill out by the end of this, say, three month process?

Melissa Perri (30:50):
Yeah, I think it varies from company to company. Some companies already have their own template, and I'll just use that. I don't try to reinvent the wheel when it doesn't need to be reinvented. But I'll say the memos that we would write are probably... They're very easy to explain, two pages for me on what's the vision, where are we going after, how are we positioned in the market and against competition to reach that vision, where are we today, what's the current state of our product, what does it actually look like, what are we going to do to get there, what's our priorities. And then I make people prioritize them, so I'm like, if we're going this way, are we solving this problem? What does that mean, context-wise? And then, what are the outcomes that we're actually trying to achieve when we get there?

(31:33):
And I do that at different levels. So we typically have executive teams writing the strategic intents for the business level. We've got product management leadership, directors, VPs, CPOs writing the product initiatives. Usually the CPOs aren't writing them, it's more like director-level VP for their scope. Product initiatives are usually very problem-oriented around big problems we can solve for our customers. They're meaty. They're usually made up of multiple epics. And then you've got your product teams on the ground floor working with the developers. I use [inaudible 00:32:07] everybody doesn't agree on what they are. I call them options, sometimes, too, but it's the solutions. What's the solutions you're going to build to actually get into those product initiatives? Solve those problems for the users, and then hit those strategic intents.

(32:22):
So you have to pretty much write a one-pager or two-pager like that for every one of those levels, and I think that's great. I think the more we write about these things, the more we talk about it, the more we put it into pros, the better. And it's not like a product requirements document that's 20 pages, it's like a two-pager, just explaining what we're doing and why. And that context, we usually throw into Google docs or Wiki or something like that, link them all together so that you can go from one to the next, and then read all the way up the strategy tree.

Lenny (32:50):
I love that. It's so simple and not so formulaic that it feels like any company could do it, and it's not this rigid, one way to do it process.

Melissa Perri (33:00):
Yeah. And I don't think there should be for certain things. I think every company, with a lot of these processes and tools and frameworks that we get into, you've got to massage it all and make it your own. And you're going to find certain things are going to work for one company that don't work for the other company, based on their culture and what they do. But I think the more that we can write and talk about things, the easier it is for all these different companies to find their way of working. And then you codify that, and you deploy that throughout your organization.

Lenny (33:29):
On the vision piece specifically, it reminds me, when I was managing PMs, one of the most common areas of development for them was get better vision. Because it always is like, mm, here's an opportunity to get better, vision. And it's always hard to explain exactly what that means and how it looks when they're doing better at vision, other than just coming up with an incredible idea that we execute on. So maybe very tactically, what's a form factor you suggest for folks to even lay out a vision? It sounds like you really encourage writing. Is that how you like to think about it? Or do you find storyboards are often great, or sketches, or anything else?

Melissa Perri (34:03):
Yeah. When I write out visions, I like writing. I think that, to me, is probably the easiest way I've seen people lay it out. I've also seen people put together a great [inaudible 00:34:14] was in there consulting. We had one team with a fantastic head of UX and a VP of product who would sit there together, and they made a great presentation of the vision. But they mocked up prototypes of what it could be. And it wasn't tested or set, but the visual pieces of that got people really aligned over, oh, okay. And the diagrams, I find, when you can show how certain things relate to each other, sometimes it does come off in words.

(34:44):
So I like a combination. I like a combination of some kind of presentation plus writing. And I think if you do those two things together, it becomes really powerful. But for me and for a lot of people, especially executives I've seen too, sometimes they're more visually oriented. So if you can grab your UX designer and sit there and sketch out ideas... And it doesn't even have to be wire frames. It doesn't have to be the end state of the product. It could just be how customers interact with things, or diagrams about the ecosystem and stuff like that. That just helps to draw a little bit more color on it. But I think those two things go hand-in-hand.

Lenny (35:20):
I love that. I find that anytime I have a designer helping me with anything like that, I always look so much smarter...

Melissa Perri (35:20):
Oh, so much better.

Lenny (35:20):
... because they made it look so much better. Yeah, exactly.

Melissa Perri (35:20):
Oh, I love it.

Lenny (35:20):
Such a superpower.

Melissa Perri (35:32):
It is. And it's amazing. But I've seen that in every type of presentation. You bring in a designer to help you with board slides, and you're like, oh my God, it all makes sense now. I could talk over these types of things...

Lenny (35:32):
Right, you look like a genius.

Melissa Perri (35:45):
Yeah, you look like a genius. You're like, damn, these look real good. So I think there's just such a joint relationship with any type of presentation where you're trying to explain where you're going or what you want to do. If you can explain it through visuals and with design, it's just going to be so much better for everybody.

Lenny (36:02):
Yeah. On the vision piece, do you have any general advice for getting better at vision?

Melissa Perri (36:07):
I try to think about a lot of... There's a couple tips, here. One, a vision should be concrete enough where people can picture what it will be in their head. It can't be a fluffy... be the backbone of healthcare. What does that mean? I don't get it. So people need to be able to look at a vision and say, I can understand that we're going to get there one day. I don't know how we're going to get there today, but we will find out along the way. That's a good vision. It's lofty, far enough away where you can't just be like, oh, we build that one thing, we hit it. That's not a lofty enough vision. It should be something that you really want to iterate through, and test, and try to figure out how to get there.

(36:53):
It should not be what you are at today. That's a sign of, you hit the vision already and maybe you're just tweaking and exploiting it, which is totally fine. But that's not really a good vision for the future.

(37:04):
I'd say, too, the way that I think through it is, how are we different? And it's crazy how many visions I've read where nobody actually talks about how they're different. It's like, we're going to be the best. Be the best, all right. How are you going to do that? And I think it's fine, while you're formulating a vision.

(37:27):
And this is why I personally like writing. I just literally brain dump in there, and be like, well, our competitor A does X, Y, and Z, and we definitely don't want to be like that. So what could we do to be different? We could do this, this, and this. And if you just brain dump all those ideas about what type of value it will bring for your customers, who you want your customers to be. Sometimes I don't read about future customers or who you want those customers to be in the future. How is the value different than the value you provide today? Is it going to be different, or just doubling down on what you do? The ways that you provide those values, how is it different than your competitors? Why is it better? Not just being better, but why is it better? What's the ways that you're going to win?

(38:15):
And then also, I think good visions also say what you don't want to do. I love reading a vision that's like, we're not going to be like that. And that, to me, is so powerful because you're like, oh, okay, we're not going to copy that. We're not going to go after that. Because you can easily have a whole team be like, oh, let's just copy what they did over there.

Lenny (38:33):
I'm learning a ton. Thank you for sharing all this. This is, for me, really helpful, too.

(38:38):
On that topic a little bit, say a PM wants to get better at strategy, which we talked a little bit about. Do you have any advice, someone trying to get better at being more strategic in thinking about strategy?

Melissa Perri (38:49):
Yeah. It was interesting. I was just talking to one of the chief product officers who graduated from my program last year, and now she's the CPO of a company. And I said, what was your advice for especially people who are not chief product officers yet, or ICs? Because I hear from a lot of people, I'm not getting the opportunity to work on strategy. And I loved her advice because she said, even when I didn't have that role or responsibility or that scope, I sat there and I still imagined what I would do if I was in their position. And I think that's powerful. Pretend you're the CPO. Would you do something different? What would you do? Can you dig into the data? Can you ask questions? Can you get into there?

(39:29):
And I'm not saying, go reinvent the wheel for the company. But it's going to give you reps. It's going to give you the experience asking those questions. So I think that's powerful, picturing what you would do in their scenario.

(39:42):
If you want to get better at strategy, talk to people who really understand the market, really understand the financials. I'd go talk to your chief product officer if you have one and just ask them, what's your process? How do you set this? We got to these three priorities, or something, how'd you get there? What'd you look at? I think that's important, just having conversations with people about what their thought process is, how they analyzed it, what that means. I think that's really important.

(40:08):
When you get into setting strategy at higher levels for product, a lot of it has to do with the market, and the customers, and the financials, and things that we don't get exposed to as much as a team-level product manager. So the more you can talk to people in other disciplines... Go have a conversation with sales and see why people were buying competitors? What was your win-loss analysis? Why are we losing? What do you think is the issue? A lot of times, we just don't go and talk to other departments. And they have a wealth of knowledge. And we've got subject matter experts sitting in certain places that can fill you in on how the market's moving, and what things are happening there, and how people are innovating. And it is fascinating to talk to those people.

(40:50):
So I would do that. I would talk to other departments. I would talk to your leadership, try to understand their thought process.

(40:56):
If you are a leader and trying to figure out how to do a lot of this, one of the biggest issues I see for leaders, and why I got very excited about product operations over the last couple years, is the lack of data. One issue I see is that leaders have never really set strategy before, so they get into these positions and they don't know where to start.

(41:17):
And the place that you need to start is data from everywhere. You need to start with internal data, and you need to have an analyst on your team. I also tell them, hire a data analyst. Hire somebody, some ex-McKinsey consultants. They're great at crunching data. I had them on my team. It's amazing. But they'll pull the numbers out. They'll find interesting patterns for you. And you say, I want to answer these questions, and they will go get the data for you, put it into ways that you can actually look at it, and then you can actually start making informed decisions.

(41:45):
So you want to take that data. You want to take customer research, so whoever is talking to customers, you want to bubble that up and make sure that you can see that as well. You want to take the company goals and put that into context.

(41:55):
And then, really, strategy always comes down to asking the questions about how can we win, how can we get further to the goal, which is the vision. But it's also keeping into context of where we are now and what we're able to execute on now. And I think it's interesting because we don't always make the right choice when it comes to strategy, but you've got to make a choice. And I think that's the hardest part for some people. They're like, I want to be 100% certain this is going to work. And you can't. And I think a good aspect of being a leader, whether you're a product manager on a team or even an executive, is making the best informed decision that you possibly can at the time, but then also being willing to correct yourself if you find out it's the wrong one by looking at all the information, and then saying, okay, let's try something different.

(42:44):
And that, to me, is how we do great strategy. We take all the information we can, we make the best possible guess to go in one direction, and then we just keep reevaluating it to make sure it's the right direction. And if it's not, we pivot.

Lenny (43:00):
I love that your answer is talking to people, getting information, gathering data, thinking, and it's not, go read books on strategy, go get an MBA, or anything like that. You get better by doing it and learning from other people, right?

Melissa Perri (43:12):
Yeah, and seeing it, too. For me, when I'm learning about strategy, because it's not like I just started project management and started doing strategy immediately, I analyzed how other companies did it. So I was like, how did Netflix do their strategy? How did this company do their strategy? And reading how a company goes from point A to point B is fascinating. There's tons of articles on there about how companies have done it. But it just helps you see that everybody does it differently. Everybody's got a different framework. Doesn't matter what framework you use, as long as it works for your company. But they all got to that framework by asking those questions, and looking at the data, and deeply understanding their market, and deeply understanding their customers, and just trying to piece it all together.

Lenny (43:54):
Awesome. You touched on product operations, which I know is the book that you're working on now. I know that there's a role, an emerging role, product operations. Can you give us a preview of that this book's going to be about and what people should be thinking about there?

Melissa Perri (44:07):
Yeah. Having worked with all these companies, especially the ones that are scaling pretty rapidly, I started realizing, hey, we trained all the teams. We deployed the strategy. We've got a bunch of people, now, in this product management role. And then you look at certain things, and you realize it just didn't scale to the rest of the team. And things broke down. One standardization of processes, everybody had a different roadmap. Cool, I can't do anything with that when I'm trying to set a strategy. If I can't compare your roadmap to that roadmap, all your time horizons are off, all your data is off, nothing's set in the right format, I can't roll that up into my strategy as product leader.

(44:47):
Two, maybe there's no career ladders for the product mangers. Three, we're having 18 different types of meetings and all the wrong people are in the room.

(44:55):
Product mangers can get the data that they need to make the informed decisions on the product strategy. We're interviewing customers one off, and then I find out the same team is hitting up all these customers over here again. They're getting really upset. These customers don't want to talk to the same team over and over and over again.

(45:11):
Product management at scale is really hard, and that's where product operations comes in. So what it does is it helps you get the right insights to the team, and then help standardize those outputs and those check-ins to make sure that you're on track for the right strategy.

(45:26):
There's usually three parts to it that I say, and not all companies have all three. And it depends where you're at for where you want to start with this. But typically, we have internal data and insights, and that's a team that's going in and taking all the data that we have that lives in our financial systems, our user analytics, all of these different things that live inside our company, and they're helping to surface this up in ways that people can look at them, see the progress of our strategy, and track those OKRs, and say, okay, we're going to go this way or that way. So that helps give us the inputs we need for strategy, helps monitor the strategy, and it helps us make decisions.

(46:02):
Then, there's also customer research and user insight, so that's really the external data. And market research. Customer insights and market research. So that's the external data that doesn't live in our company that we need to get from our customers or our market to help inform strategy.

(46:17):
So from a market research perspective, that might mean having subscriptions to publications, or making sure that we have subject matter experts who are giving this great advice where the market's moving. But then also, for customer research, it's standardizing the approach so that product managers can go talk to customers so we're not hitting up the same person all the time. We're recording all the user interviews we do in a way where we can actually search through it and gain that information later, when we go and revisit those things. It's really helping to streamline it. It's not centralizing user research as a practice, it's helping to scale user research so that we can enable more people to do user research, especially when you get into some of these companies.

(46:59):
When I first started doing this, it was at Athena Health, and we had 350 product managers. And we had to make sure they weren't bothering the people at the same hospital over and over and over again because they were when we came in. And we said, wow, okay, cool. We've asked these people, now, the same question 10 times from 10 different teams. How do we make sure that those things don't happen, but how do we also empower those product managers to go still talk to them when they need to? So we're not taking user research away, we're just helping make it more scalable, more efficient, give them more tools for it.

(47:30):
And then the last one is standardizing your processes, your cadences for strategy check-in. So it's like, hey, we do roadmap check-ins every month. These are the people that need to be in the room. We do quarterly planning sessions with executives, and this is the inputs to it, this is the outputs to it, here's the decisions we make in this meeting. This is what we review. And those people can help do that part, and then help standardize the product management processes that touch other divisions. For instance, if I need to update roadmaps to sales, they will help own that cadence of what that looks like and how those formats go out.

(48:08):
But what I say is it doesn't standardize stuff that only belongs to a team. I don't care how a team does their stand-ups. You choose how to do that. I'm not going to standardize that. But I do care what format your roadmap comes in. I do care how we make sure that we have a good working relationship with sales. I do care that we have a good working relationship with product marketing, those types of functions. That's the interactions we want to standardize.

Lenny (48:32):
I can't wait to read this book. When do you think it'll be coming out?

Melissa Perri (48:35):
We're aiming to get it out before the end of the year.

Lenny (48:38):
Oh, wow. Okay. That's pretty soon.

Melissa Perri (48:40):
I know. It's coming up.

Lenny (48:43):
On that topic, as a PM trying to learn, trying to get better, there's so much information out there. There's books, newsletters (guilty of that), tweets, advice, podcast, all these things that are always coming at you as a PM. And I hear a lot from PMs that are burnt out from all the information always coming at them. It's just never ending advice. Do you have any advice for either new PMs or just any PM of how to take in knowledge that's all out there, and not just burn out?

Melissa Perri (49:14):
I'm going to burn them out with more advice. [inaudible 00:49:17] the advice.

Lenny (49:17):
This is the only advice they'll need.

Melissa Perri (49:21):
So I'd say, one, the best thing that you could possibly do as a product manager, even if you've been in this role for a while, is to make sure that you're always learning. But the way that you're going to learn the most, usually, is from execution. So what I'd say is first, focus on that. Focus on doing your job every day.

(49:41):
Then, I would analyze your job and say, what's working? What's not working? And then, take out certain pieces of it that you want to get better at, and then do a deep dive into that.

(49:49):
So for me, when I was thinking about my career and my stuff, I did a similar approach where I'd just run into problems, and I'm like, I need to learn more about why that problem is causing this. One of them was Agile. I found out that a bunch of people who never did product management before became product owners. They were writing 8,000 user stories for very small, little features. I'm like, why are you writing so many user stories? So I went down a rabbit hole, interviewing everybody who wrote the Agile manifesto and [inaudible 00:50:19] and taught all those things to find out where this came from, so then I could figure out how to fix it.

(50:24):
And I think you need to carve stuff out like that, where you go, what's this topic I want to get better at? What's this going to do to help me get to the next level? Where do I need to learn and help fill in my skill gaps? For instance, if you're not great at user research, or you haven't had a lot of experience talking to customers, I might deep dive on that. If you're not great at data analytics, I could deep dive on that.

(50:46):
But I think there's a certain point where we get to, okay, I understand the basic product framework, and everybody's going to have different opinions about what that framework should look like. But we all generally agree at the end of the day, you should be talking to your users, you should be working with your teams to develop what a test should be, run some tests, figure out what your users want, build it with your team in an iterative fashion, measure success, and keep going from there. That all generally stays the same. But how you do each part of that, you're going to find some people have one opinion, some people don't. And you have to find something that works for you, and then stick with it, and then find out that if it doesn't work for you, change it.

(51:26):
And this is where I get really passionate and frustrated with Agile processes, which I used to rant about a lot. But I feel like some places, we've solved this problem, some places we haven't. But I try to tell teams that started with scrum or started with some of these more dogmatic processes, if it doesn't serve you, move on. Change it. Everything is meant to be iterated on. Everything is meant to be adapted. If it does not work for you, you do not have to keep doing it.

(51:55):
And I think that's the biggest message I can tell to anybody learning, is really, sit down, do a retrospective with yourself, and say, is this helping me get better at being a product manager? And if it's not, change it. Change your approach. Do something different. If it is, keep it. Keep it in your toolbox. Create your own toolbox and go from there.

Lenny (52:16):
What a perfect way to end our conversation. Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be helpful to you?

Melissa Perri (52:24):
Yeah. I am on Twitter all the time @lissijean, so feel free to tweet with me. I love hearing what you guys are up to. You can also submit questions, if you have questions, to me at the Product Thinking podcast. So if you go to productthinkingpodcast.com, or dearmelissa.com, I take questions there all the time.

(52:46):
I'm always curious what everybody's thinking about. What are your questions? What are your burning questions? That's how you can help me. I am very passionate about figuring out what are the problems that we're facing as product managers, and that's what makes me happy, trying to figure out where they're coming from, how do we solve it, what's on people's mind. So definitely hit me up with questions. I always answer them on the podcast.

(53:08):
And then my website, melissaperri.com, has all my other information, if anybody needs to get in touch.

Lenny (53:13):
Amazing. If anyone has any problems in their PM job, just tweet you, and they will get an answer, is what you're saying.

Melissa Perri (53:19):
Yes. Do that.

Lenny (53:21):
Amazing. Thank you so much, Melissa.

Melissa Perri (53:24):
Thank you.

Lenny (53:24):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast, and even better, leave a review, which helps a lot. You can also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# Everything you’ve ever wanted to know about SAFe and the product owner role | Melissa Perri

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
There's this whole concept of SAFe, basically Scaled Agile, right?

Melissa Perri (00:00:03):
Scaled Agile Framework came out of the desire to figure out how do we scale Scrum and different processes. I do not recommend using SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who likes SAFe, found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
You've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with product owners, Scaled Agile, and all these things.

Melissa Perri (00:00:23):
This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today. It was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on. I ended up going to a ton of Agile conferences and speaking about product management, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
It feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work.

Melissa Perri (00:00:44):
A lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. When you look at agile methodologies, what we're really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):
Today my guest is Melissa Perri. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational book Escaping the Build Trap, and her most recent book Product Operations. She's also the CEO and founder of The Product Institute, which trains product managers at all levels. She's trained PMs at almost every Fortune 500 company at this point, and in our conversation we dive deep into a topic that I don't spend a lot of time on on this podcast, product owners, Scrum, Scaled Agile, and building product at very large non-tech companies.

(00:01:38):
Melissa shares the history behind these ways of working, what she's seen work and not work when companies roll out these frameworks, and most importantly what you can do as a leader at one of these companies and as a product owner working in one of these companies to level up your organization and yourself. I learned a ton from this conversation and I'm really curious to hear what you think since we don't cover this kind of stuff on this podcast too much. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri. Melissa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Melissa Perri (00:02:19):
Thanks, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):
First, let me give a little context on this conversation that we're having. I think it's going to be a little bit unique. I was doing a deep dive on the job market in tech, and I saw something that was really surprising to me that the product owner role was the third-fastest growing role in tech, and this was just in the US, the data I was looking at, but I think it's probably true broadly. This was extremely surprising to me because I've never worked with a product owner, I don't hear anyone in my circles talking about product owners, I've never wanted to hire a product owner, and it feels like it's just this very different part of the tech ecosystem that you don't hear a lot about on podcasts like this, and it's clearly growing so I felt like it'd be really helpful to spend some time helping people and helping me understand this part of the world.

(00:03:08):
I asked you to come on to talk about this. You've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with this way of working with product owners, Scaled Agile and all these things, so I couldn't think of a better person to have on here to help us understand what's happening here, and also just to help people do this better. Melissa, thank you again for coming on and helping us understand this.

Melissa Perri (00:03:28):
Yeah, I'm excited to talk about this. I have been really passionate about this topic for many years and I've been talking about it in both agile circles and product management circles, so pretty excited for the listeners to hear what else is going on out there.

(00:05:06):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:13):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, [inaudible 00:05:22], and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:31):
Yes. We just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:53):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema, not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:06:05):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:24):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co.

(00:06:39):
Before we get into the history, is there just anything broadly that you think might be helpful to share before we dive into the history of the product owner role and all these things?

Melissa Perri (00:06:46):
Maybe it'll help to set some context of where did I see all of this start emerging as well. When I started in tech, I was very much a product manager, never heard of the product owner role before in my life. In Escaping the Build Trap I talk a lot about how we used Scrum when I started working with this team in a startup, and it was the first time I ever heard of it. That was 2011. At the time, the person who was teaching me about agile was very like, "Hey, this is flexible. We're just going to break things into sprints. We're going to sit there and actually talk about the work. This is made for us to actually get better at our jobs." We were pretty sold on it and it was never dogmatic. As I worked at other companies, I found that they were being a little more dogmatic with their Scrum, with their stand-ups, how we actually run things.

(00:07:36):
Then I started speaking at conferences, and one of the first conferences I spoke at in New York City was called Lean UX, and there was a bunch of people from the agile world there too. I learned that this was much bigger than what we were learning in my company and what we were doing in these companies. There's this whole group of people out there practicing agile, and I was like, "Oh, this is cool. I want to learn how to do things better. Teach me about your philosophies." I ended up going to a ton of agile conferences and speaking about product management.

(00:08:04):
At the time, people were really excited to hear more about it, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum where I was talking more about how we traditionally talk about product management, understand your customer, go out test things, make sure there's a hypothesis, don't just blindly build what you want to build. I found out that that was not the case in a lot of these companies who are adopting Scrum and introducing a product owner role, so I started doing a lot of trainings through my school product institute and I'd get called into these large companies, all these large banks, probably around 2014, 2015, to help them learn product management. I was really excited about this because before, they didn't want anything to do with it. They were like, "I don't know what product management is. I don't need this."

(00:08:47):
I go in to train people and I found that a lot of them had been going through an agile transformation and they had all of these new product owners where they came in and they basically said, "Hey, you're a product owner now. Your whole role has changed." They came from all different backgrounds. Some were developers, so a lot were business people who worked on the banking side, a lot were business analysts, some were project managers, but they just collectively took a bunch of people and said, "Tada, today you're going to be a product owner because we're going to do agile now." I will come in and help train these people.

(00:09:20):
What I found was that there was a really big misconception about what those people should be doing compared to what they teach in agile and Scrum versus what we all consider great product management. I've been trying to fill that gap for the last almost 10 years working with these companies here. Then I would go to their leaders and at the beginning of these agile transformations, I'd be like, "You can't just do Scrum. That's not going to make you amazing at delivering products. There's so much more to this." The leaders didn't quite understand that.

(00:09:51):
I'm noticing this really big shift in the industry where we're finally getting there. A lot of companies are doing it well now. Capital One is a great example that took their agile transformation and started adding product management on it, and they've really turned that around in the card business. So many organizations are still at the beginning of this journey and they're at the place where I saw people 10 years ago. I think there's still a lot of companies out there. Maybe we take it for granted in tech or in Silicon Valley about how many companies are doing this and how big this scope is where they're making these roles, but they're not really doing product management end to end. That's where I've seen all of these areas and I've been trying to help organizations for the last 10 years really set up robust product management practices. It's not just one piece of development, it's how do we actually build better products?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:42):
I love this example of Capital One. It can work really well and you can get to a place where it's actually really productive. There's a few ways we can go about this. Do you think it would be helpful to talk through the history of the product owner role just like where it initially emerged?

Melissa Perri (00:10:56):
Yeah, I think that's a great place to start. I think it brings a lot of context too to what's happening. People forget about the history here. When I explain it to people, I say we had product managers in Silicon Valley, right? They were in Google, they were in all of these companies, Amazon, and they were born out of this business role. From a software native company, your software is the business, right? It's what you sell, it's what you actually look at. Our product managers in Silicon Valley, they're doing market research, they're talking to customers, they're working with developers, they're iterating, they're doing the end-to-end product management.

(00:11:31):
What happened on the other side of things, especially in large companies, is the emergence of product management from Scrum, from product ownership. That's usually the first time these companies were introduced to product management was from implementing a product owner role and then going, "Hey, we're still not meeting our goals. Are we building the right thing?" Then they started thinking product management. Where that role came from is Scrum. If we go back and talk about the history of agile, agile was a movement that got started by software developers. In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was written. A bunch of developers got together in Park City, Utah, they were all skiing together and they said, "Hey, we've been independently all working on how to develop software better."

(00:12:18):
Some people were practicing Scrum as we know it today. That was Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland. There were people who were doing different types of agile frameworks as well, Kanban, where you were moving it through a Kanban board. There was behavioral-driven development, there was feature-driven development. That was the style of agile. There was XP, extreme programming, that was started by Ron Jeffries. All of these people found each other saying, "Hey, we've been trying to push the boundaries of how do we develop better software," and they got together and they wrote the Agile Manifesto as we know it today.

(00:12:51):
The Agile Manifesto is really just a guideline on how they're striving to not just be people who code what people want, but building better products. How do we build better products through software development? The premise to remember this is, and I keep saying it, but they're all software developers. Nobody was a product manager who went to that meeting. Nobody who wrote the Agile Manifesto was actually a product manager. I've spent a long time talking to these people as well over the past 10 years just saying, "Hey, how did this come about? Where did this come from?"

(00:13:23):
The one person who was really close to them who was a product manager was Jeff Patton, but he never signed the Agile Manifesto, he wasn't at that meeting. He talked to them a lot, he was able to see what was going on, but all of this was a purge from how do we build better products from a development perspective. That's really important to know. Two of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto, Jeff and Ken, as I was talking about, they were independently coming up with Scrum on their own in their different companies, and they got together and started to codify it and they said, "This is how I'm doing it, this is how I'm doing it." They ended up writing the Scrum Guide. The Scrum Guide is what a lot of people base their agile practices off of today. In the Scrum Guide, it outlines a bunch of roles that you would do on the development team, and then it says how you should be developing products.

(00:14:11):
Most people out there are working in Scrum today, and what they say is, "Let's break things down into two-week sprints." You can change the length of your sprint if you want to, but two-week sprints is pretty standard at the beginning. We define what we're going to work on in the backlog. It's the product owner's responsibility to define what goes into the backlog, write down the user stories for it, do all that. Then the development team comes in, they discuss it, the product owner prioritizes it, they ask questions, and then the development team commits to what they want to build and they go out and do it. At the end, the result is a potentially shippable product, not necessarily shippable, but potentially shippable.

(00:14:48):
They're trying to break it down into small chunks and build things instead of what they had been doing in a lot of companies, which was building stuff for three years and then releasing it in a big bang. What all of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto realized was if we do it the other way, if we do a waterfall type environment, agile waterfall, that's where we go across, there's a lot of risk because we don't test it with the customer and we don't get feedback on it if we spend three years building it and never show it to somebody. It really approached a different way of building software. It said let's chunk it down and try to get feedback faster. Really noble intention.

(00:15:24):
In the Scrum guide though, it introduces these new roles. We have developers as we know and love them, we also have a product owner, then we have a Scrum master, and the Scrum master is in charge in Scrum of actually helping people do Scrum better. That's literally their job. How do I do Scrum better? How do I make sure that the team is working well together? They host things like retrospectives where at the end of a sprint we say what went well, what didn't go well, how should we actually inspect and adapt our process. The product owner is where things get murky.

(00:15:57):
The product owner in general first showed up with Scrum, and if you go and you read the first Scrum guide, which I pulled up and started reading, because I've been very fascinated about how this is described, it says that the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of work done, the team does the work. Interesting, because now the product owner is not quite part of the team. The team consists of developers with all the skills to turn the product owner's request into the potentially shippable increment each sprint. The team is usually seven plus or minus two members.

(00:16:29):
Then when you go further into the first version of the Scrum Guide, it does say that the Scrum master works with the customers and management to identify and instantiate a product owner. The Scrum master teaches the product owner how to do his or her job in order to optimize the value of the use of Scrum. If they don't, the Scrum master is held accountable. Then it's got another tip if we go deeper into this. It says per commercial development, the product owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the product owner could be the user department manager.

(00:17:01):
What's interesting is that that was the first version of the Scrum Guide, and I get into arguments about the Scrum Guide with people all the time. 2013's version though, the more updated one that you could go and find is the one that almost every company has run an agile transformation off of. It loses that thing that says the product manager could be the product owner. It doesn't say it anywhere in that guide. This was the first version, and you can kind of tell it was an aside. It's like, "Oh, by the way, the product owner in Scrum doesn't need to be a product manager, it could be the customer, it could be a developer." It's usually the customer.

(00:17:34):
When they were writing this too, sometimes the customer was an internal person at a bank or somewhere where we were building software who was asking for the software. They were like, "Go build me an internal tool. Go do this." Now we're just asking for requirements inside a company, and that's where you can start to see how the product owner role kind of evolved into somebody going to ask, "Hey, what do you want me to build? What's required here?," and then just listening to somebody come back and say, "I need this feature, I need this feature, I need this feature." Scrum doesn't describe how to get the stuff into the backlog, and it didn't in the 2013 manuals. The manuals have all been a little bit better, they've all kind of been updated since then, and they do describe it has to start with the vision a little bit more, you have to break down the vision for the product and get in there, but none of that existed in the early versions of Scrum.

(00:18:29):
When people got trained on how to be a product owner, what was happening here is, and this is the whole other world of Scrum over here, when people get trained to be a product owner, it's usually a two-day class where they teach them, "Hey, this is how you break down a backlog. This is how you do stand-ups with your teams. This is how you think about prioritizing work. This is how you manage your backlog, prioritize it for the developers. This is how you work with the retrospectives," but it doesn't teach them about experimentation, it doesn't teach them about market research, it doesn't teach them about data, it doesn't teach them about any of the things that we need to be a product manager.

(00:19:06):
Then what happened was we went into these agile transformations at these companies and they said, "Hey, let's adopt Scrum because Scrum was built as a way to build better products faster." It's literally the tagline. Everybody was like, "Yeah, I want to build products faster. Okay, great. Let's do Scrum." All these large organizations back in the early 2010s, in the 2000s said, "Oh, we got to be better at software. How do we do this better? Otherwise, we're going to lose when it comes to innovation." They adopted Scrum as a way to build software faster.

(00:19:42):
Now, what happened is in order to do Scrum, Scrum basically sells training. That's what Scrum does. All of these agile coaches would come in and teach the product owners, newly minted product owners, took all those people, made them into product owners, put them through a two-day class and then say, "Go." That was the beginning of all the agile transformations, and that's where a lot of companies still are today. This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today, it was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on, but that was it. The product owner was held accountable for making sure that they were working on the most pressing things or the highest value things, they do say that, but to me, if you look at it from a developer perspective, it's also the person where you can say, "Hey, well, you told me to build that, right? We didn't build it wrong. You told me to build that."

(00:20:35):
It almost gets into consulting territory where you're like, "Okay. If the product owner prioritized all this stuff for me and told me what to do, I can't be held accountable if it was the wrong thing to build." Some of that stuff does come up in a lot of teams that struggle to adopt agile, to adopt Scrum. I feel like there's a big misunderstanding out there about what is this role and what should we be doing, but the premise of this is when we talk about Scrum, it's just one piece of the puzzle, and when people talk about agile now, they almost always associate it with Scrum.

(00:21:10):
I was actually Googling agile methodologies, and like I said, the other ones, Kanbans is an agile methodology, XP is an agile methodology. They don't have product owners, they do not exist in those methodologies. There are four developers to work on things, or teams to work on things. XP would consider product managers in the teams as far as I know it, but Scrum kind of sees it as a separate thing.  Agile methodologies, everybody says, "Oh, they're Scrum now," so it gets a bad connotation out there about what to do with it. I think Scrum if you do it well is bad, but you have to understand that it's just one piece of building great products, it's not the whole thing, and companies will adopt it like it's going to radically transform everything. To be fair, a lot of times it's sold that way too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:59):
There's a bigger picture question that's coming to mind as you talk about this. I'm imagining founders listening to this and smaller companies listening to this be like, "Why do we need any of this?", especially Silicon Valley startups, "We're just going to build stuff. We don't need these frameworks, we don't need a Scrum master. We just have awesome developers and product managers and we're just going to build awesome stuff." I don't know anyone that has worked this way that has built amazing things. Can you talk a bit about who ends up looking for solutions here, where this even comes from, what companies need help here versus, "I just don't need any of this?"

Melissa Perri (00:22:36):
A lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. They're looking at how do I implement something that has rigor at scale, and that's where you see a lot of Scrum come up. Now, I've seen startups using Scrum. Some of them do it fine, they understand that it's just more about trying to get things out the door every two weeks to test it with customers. I think if you keep that philosophy, like I said, I used it and we didn't have a lot of rigor around it, that was fine. When we were doing Scrum, when I did it with my team back in OpenSky, we got to this point where we were like, "Two weeks is too long. We're just going to ship things every week."

(00:23:12):
We just talked to each other, we skipped stand-ups, which is sacrilege in Scrum, but we kipped daily stand-ups. We didn't need to stand around and talk about it, we talked to each other every day. For me, what was amazing and where I see teams actually thrive when they start using Scrum is when you go and talk to people. You're having the conversations about the work, you're breaking it down, you're understanding it, so the developers and the rest of the team can go hit the road running and people can ask important questions. If you're not doing that, that's where I think things like a framework help, but if you already are doing that, you don't need a framework, you don't need Scrum, you don't need to be prescribed to this two-week sprint or anything like that.

(00:23:52):
As long as you have a methodology, it doesn't even have to be a defined methodology. As long as you have a way of working that gets things out to customers, well, who cares? Who actually cares? Where there's a lot of, I think, baggage in the industry and where I hear product managers get really frustrated and other people as well, developers too, is that when you do Scrum by the book or how people teach it and how they write about it, it's a million meetings. I know they were put in there so that people were forced to talk, but when you already know what you're supposed to work on, why do you need to keep doing meetings? Shouldn't you just go do some work?

(00:24:28):
A lot of developers complain, a lot of product managers complain that Scrum has too many meetings and they don't actually get to do work. That's where I think you have to go back to the inspect and adapt part. A lot of people who are very religious about Scrum will come and yell at me about this. They're like, "Oh, well, that's not how it's supposed to be. You're supposed to inspect and adapt." Agree, but a lot of people aren't doing it and that's the piece where you go and you say, "Is this serving us? If not, let's get rid of it. Let's not do those types of things." When you're a small startup, I don't think you need a lot of this overhead. It's really much designed for larger scale companies, and those are the ones that you see really adopting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:06):
From what I've seen on the data, it's also companies that are as you I think alluded to at the beginning, not necessarily software first, product first companies. Feels like it's very common in banks and telecom companies and companies that aren't product First and software first.

Melissa Perri (00:25:21):
There are SaaS companies that do Scrum out there and they like it, and I don't think they're very dogmatic about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):
Got it. Yeah.

Melissa Perri (00:25:28):
They do it for a reason of just trying to provide some more context to their teams about how to work together at scale. I've also seen places where they don't prescribe whatever methodology you want to work with for the teams, but instead they'll spend a lot more effort breaking down the road maps, thinking about what are we going to do each quarter, trying to set those themes, and then they just let the teams run, and that works as well. I think it really depends how they adopt it, but I would say it's not a hard and fast rule that no startups are doing this. Some are doing it, I just don't know how it's going for them. To me, it might be overkill if you're doing that with a team that's pretty experienced in doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
What I was insinuating is less just Scrum as a general idea and more very structured rigid processes and also product owners. Then there's this whole concept of SAFe that we can talk about. Should we get into that or should we talk about product manager versus product owner and just the challenges people have there?

Melissa Perri (00:26:33):
Let's talk about SAFe because that's where a lot of this started to get Confusing

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
Okay, cool. Let's go there. Yeah.

Melissa Perri (00:26:37):
Scaled Agile Framework came out of the desire to figure out how do we scale Scrum and different processes and bring it to organizations at scale. It originated from a more structured approach to agile too called Rational Unified Processing. Now, SAFe wasn't the first thing that started at scale. There was also LeSS, which is a Scaled Agile Framework, and then Jeff Sutherland who did Scrum has Scrum@Scale. It's not the only scaling framework out there. There's a lot, there's actually a lot out there, but SAFe was one that was marketed the best. The way it's marketed is will tell you everything you need to do, to do all of your agile teams with Scrum and put them all together.

(00:27:22):
The idea behind SAFe was that Dean Leffingwell came up with it. He wanted to really show how you tie multiple teams together at scale in an organization and how do you bring some rigor and process to that. The executives at really large enterprises, we're talking tens of thousands of people, they love SAFe because it prescribes a lot of an operating model of what to do when it comes to development, but it also gets billed as like, "Hey, this is the whole model for you to go do software." If you look at it, it's a big map that everybody kind of makes fun of a little bit, and it describes all different things on it if you look at the map. You can click in and you can see the definitions and you can see what's going on in the areas.

(00:28:10):
The SAFe image has gotten bigger and bigger over time. I think, what is this? Version six. I do know a lot of people who worked on SAFe, so I know a lot of trainers and I've worked with companies. The first time I was introduced to SAFe was when I was working with a bank back in 2015. I came in to train their product managers, I'm doing my training, we're setting them up on how to go talk to customers, talk about hypotheses, MVP, and somebody came up to me and they said, "Hey, Melissa, all of this is great, but I don't have time to go talk to customers because I'm a product owner." I was like, "Well, what are you doing on a day-to-day basis? What don't you have time for it?", "I got to write my user stories." I'm like, "Okay. How many user stories do you write per day?"

(00:28:53):
This was for the developers to have a full backlog so they could all work, right? She's like, "Oh, yeah. I spend pretty much 40 hours a day writing user stories." I'm like, "On what?" We're like, "What are you controlling?" She's like, "The login API for a bank." I'm like, "Can you log in?" She's like, "Yeah," and I'm like, "So what else are you working on? Is there a new initiative? Is there a new thing?" It's like, "No, I was reorganized into a team where I became the product owner. I have a product manager who goes and talks to customers, but then she comes and she tells me what to build, and then I write the user stories around it and I put it into the backlog for the teams." I was like, "What is this?" Then they said, "That's SAFe. This is what we're working towards."

(00:29:34):
This was my first experience with SAFe, and then I ran into another company that did it, another company, same thing over and over and over again, where all these product owners were just basically trying to keep these backlogs full for developers, and they were working on such a narrow level. When a lot of organizations too I saw it reorganized into agile teams, they did it by component. Everybody was over every tiny little feature, and these teams were massive, super huge scope, and some of the stuff was just not prioritized. It was done, you didn't need to work on it. They were finding work to do so people wouldn't get fired. That's how the product owners operated. There was all this legacy baggage sometimes in companies where they were all re-put on things by component, and they're just making up work to do.

(00:30:21):
SAFe introduced this kind of split between product manager and product owner, and if you look at the map, the product owner is part of the agile team where they sit with the Scrum masters, which is a team coach that they call here and the developers, and then the product manager is sitting with a system architect and what they call a release train engineer. What SAFe does is they pull a bunch of agile teams into a release train and you get on the train when you're ready to ship things and you make sure that it all goes pretty smoothly to get to that potential shippable increment or that big feature launch that you would be doing with SAFe. 

(00:30:58):
SAFe's really good at prescribing how to do that, they're great at describing how to do the release trains, how to bring those teams together, how to put them on it. Then they do this thing called big room planning where they get the entire release train together, all these teams, they put them in a room and in every quarter you're breaking down what we're all going to work on. Where I hear frustration from teams every time I come in and train them is that when you do big room planning, a lot of times it's a commitment. You start at the quarter, they haven't been doing good discovery because remember, these people have not been trained on good discovery so they don't really know what they should be working on, they haven't been out talking to customers a lot of times. They kind of scramble, they figure out what needs to happen. Usually they have a backlog of stuff that does need to happen, it just has to get done. They map it all out in a big room together, they commit to it, and then that's the quarter.

(00:31:47):
They ask me, "When am I supposed to do discovery?" I'm like, "Well before that ideally you should have a vision. You should be breaking it down, you should be putting discovery into that vision, talking to customers, feeding that in there." Then I hear, "We don't have time to do that because we sprint back to back." I was like, "What does that mean?", and they're like, "As a team, we go and we basically do two-week sprint into two-week sprint into two-week sprint, and I got to make sure my developers are full. I got to make sure they have things to work on. If I go take time off to go talk to customers, which also is not my job as a product owner, it's my product manager's job, they'll feed me in what the customers are saying, then I break those down into features and I can work with the developers on it." That's how all of this stuff starts going.

(00:32:32):
What happens in organizations that they don't understand here is that it's not the most efficient way to work. I see a lot of developers out there become almost ... How do you describe it? Reliant on the product manager or product owner to tell them what to do. Even though you build them this great vision and you explain what needs to happen, they go, "Oh, I can't work on it because the product owner hasn't prioritized it." Then they asked me, "If I don't have enough for the developers to do on feature work, what are they supposed to do?" I said, "I guarantee you there's a ton of tech debt they could be working on. You don't have to scope that out. Let them choose what's the most important thing. They should be working together as developers and architects to figure out how to tackle some of that tech debt, how to get into it while you're figuring out is this the right thing to be building."

(00:33:23):
With all of this stuff, people feel like they don't have time because they're in a million meetings, and the expectations of these companies is that every sprint, we're delivering software towards these roadmaps that we promised in the last quarter and we're not checking to see if they're right, we're not checking to see if they're actually helping us move it forward, and a lot of times the organizations are not set up with the right feedback mechanisms, the right user research and the right data to tell us if everything is working so they can feed that in to the next release planning. They're just planning, planning, planning, breaking it down into sprints and going.

(00:33:58):
SAFe is not good at describing how you do all that other work. In a lot of this stuff too, there's pieces that they put onto this map of SAFe where they're like, "Hey, you should do OKRs," and it's like, "This is what OKRs are. You should do a roadmap. This is what a roadmap is." How all of that cycle works together where you're balancing discovery and delivery and feeding it in is really confusing in organizations. Then what it's basically saying is a lot of the discovery work goes into the product managers, and the product managers, the product owners report into the product managers. What I've seen that doesn't work here is that you're basically making these product owners order-takers. They are extremely tactical, and then when it's time to actually be more strategic, let's say you want to be promoted to a product manager, some organizations, that's not even the same business line, not even the same career path. It's product owners go over here and product managers go here and they report into different people.

(00:34:58):
If you ever want to move from product owner to product manager, a lot of times you don't get experience with the strategy, figuring out what customers want, breaking it down, looking at the market research, determining is this valuable, is this what we should be working on. They're not even getting exposure or a chance to do that because SAFe is like, "No, that's the product manager's job. Your job is to go really deep and work with the developers."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
Wow, okay. A lot of this sounds quite absurd as someone hearing all of the details and looking at this image. That being said, many companies are adopting this. It feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work. I imagine the incentive is we just want to build great software and we don't know exactly how, and there's this process we can plug in and it'll help us do it. I guess thoughts on that, and do you find it can work or often works or often doesn't work? What is your experience with people adopting this and how it goes?

Melissa Perri (00:35:59):
I know a ton of companies that adopted SAFe about eight years ago and have gotten rid of it. Capital One just came out and said they got rid of all their agile roles, all their Scrum roles. They were early adopter of SAFe, they don't do it anymore. They wrote about that in the newspaper. I've seen it happen more often. Now, in a lot of our organizations too I'll see parts of them do SAFe and other parts not do SAFe. It could change business line to business line. I don't think though that people grasp how much it's still out there. I get questions on SAFe every single day on the podcast. Everybody asks me, "Why are we still doing this?" It's for what you said, executives buy SAFe because it's the only framework out there that basically draws them a map and says, "Plug and play, do this."

(00:36:50):
That's why everybody's so excited about it because it's the only thing that specifies things to this level, and they went, "Oh, it's something I can understand, it's something that actually has definitions around it." To be fair, that was a great thing for SAFe to do as a marketing tool. Bravo, they created this thing that everybody wants, a good product to sell, but it's overkill, and that's what I keep hearing from organizations is it's basically taking the responsibility away from leaders to go figure their stuff out themselves as well. If you are a new leader and you've just been dropped into this role, I have tremendous empathy for them because yeah, where do you get started? How do you try to run a technology organization?

(00:37:33):
Somebody came and told me, the CIO came and told me I'm in charge now. I'm in charge of all of the developers, or I'm in charge of all the product managers. Now, where do you start? I can totally tell why people adopt SAFe because you're like, "Oh, I've been looking for the handbook. I've been looking for something to do here." The problem is it's only solving a little bit of the puzzle, which is bringing those teams together. People do say it does really strains well, but it doesn't tell you also how to do your job as a leader, it leaves it all out. They talk about portfolio visions and portfolio management and SAFe there too, but more often than not, I come in and I find everybody above product owners and product managers, let's talk about directors of product, VPs of product, they don't know what they should be doing as a VP of product or a director of product. It's like, "What's my role? What should I be feeding in here?"

(00:38:23):
SAFe doesn't even have that in there, that's not even a role. Product manager going up into those levels is not really there. What do you do when you own a whole product line in an organization? What you do when you're the head of product for a credit card at a bank, right? What's my job? Doesn't say that. There's a lot of people out there in these organizations that I've been working with who I'm like, "You are supposed to be doing strategy, and this is how you do strategy. This is how you go out and talk to customers. This is the patterns that we have in software. Are you doing a platform strategy? Do you need APIs? How do you think about your app strategy, rolling it out? How do you do this here?" All of that stuff doesn't quite come from ways of working, which is what SAFe is doing. It's about how do you do your jobs in those areas?

(00:39:12):
A lot of organizations who adopt SAFe don't realize that you need a head of product, you need somebody to actually be feeding that vision all the way down and make sure it's breaking up around the teams and controlling that portfolio vision and doing all of these things into it. I have not seen SAFe slowing down by any means out there for people adopting it, I see more and more organizations adopting it. I think we take for granted too in Silicon Valley how many people are just starting on their journey for digital transformation. There's a lot of pharmaceutical companies, banks, insurance companies, they outsource their development or they had an IT team, but they never had to really think about it before because digital wasn't as important. Now they do.

(00:39:59):
Some of these companies, most of these companies are Fortune 50 companies, right? Fortune 100 companies. I think a lot of the ones I see, at least banks, realized early on, "Hey, when it comes to apps and how people interact with our stuff, software is important," but there's a lot of companies that did not catch that train and they're just starting, and then they turn to things like SAFe because it gives them a guideline. "Hey, I've never done this before. I've been in this bank for 40 years. All I know is waterfall type development. What do we do?" Then we'll go, "We'll go look at SAFe."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:33):
I love that we spend time on that because I think it's really important. You can be cynical about all this and be like, "What the hell are people thinking? This is crazy," but as you described, people just have a problem to solve, they've never done this before, they look for solutions, they find something that seems right, they see other people doing this and like, "Okay, let's try this thing." What you've seen is it rarely actually works out the SAFe specific approach.

(00:40:59):
There's a few ways I think we can help folks. One is someone trying to do say an agile transformation or a digital transformation, your advice for how to actually do that better. Then I want to talk about say you're a product owner or a PM within an organization that works like this. What can you do? Maybe let's start with the first. Say someone's trying to figure out, "We need to build better products. Something's not working right." SAFe is an option. Your suggestion is don't maybe do that. What should people do? I know you're not going to have the answer in a short answer, but generally, how should people approach this?

Melissa Perri (00:41:33):
Yeah. When I've worked with companies on digital transformations, you want a development operating model. That's where a lot of these agile methodologies came out of. You have to understand that's just the development operating model, that's not actually going to help you with go-to-market, with launching your products and with product management. What I advise for companies to do is first sit down and say, "Hey, how do we think about building our operating model?" When I think of product operating models and what I do with companies is we break out how do you determine product strategy? Do you have a good product strategy? You look at your organizational design. How are we actually organized around our products? Do we have good coverage of product managers and do we have skilled product managers up and down the organization?

(00:42:20):
Then we want to look at product operations. Do we have the infrastructure in there to help support these teams? Can they get the data to make decisions? Can they actually be in touch with customers? A lot of these large organizations haven't actually thought through many of those steps as well that enable product managers and development teams to be successful. They don't have ways for them to go and talk to customers. That's why they're not doing it. I have a lot of empathy for people in these organizations as well who can't do product management well because of the bureaucracy or the things around it. Leaders need to solve that, right? They need to understand what the role is and they need to open it up.

(00:42:57):
Then we got to look at our culture and incentives. Are we just rewarding people for shipping as many things as possible, which is like, "Hey, just put everything you possibly can into that release train or that backlog," or are we coming back and saying, "Hey, is this valuable? Is this tying it back to our business?" Many organizations do not have a great product strategy, many large organizations that I've worked with, and it's that tying it back to the value piece, tying it back to, is this going to reach our company goals? If you are a huge organization and let's say making billions of dollars a year, and your goal is expand geographically, what are you doing in your portfolio to actually enable that? What products are you building to expand geographically? So many organizations don't have the transparency to actually even see that.

(00:43:50):
One crazy thing, a lot of people give large organizations a lot of flack for, and I know Marty does this too, for focusing on processes. I don't think processes are the enemy here. For example, if I hear somebody really worried about getting a roadmapping tool in there or something like that, I'm like, "Yes, you need that because you have no idea what your 4,000 teams are doing." If they're actually coming back to the business goals, you have no infrastructure in there to be able to see that transparency. Those types of blocking tackling is absolutely necessary for a transformation for a organization to be stood up around software product management. You have to have the transparency to actually see those things.

(00:44:29):
You do need to have enough process so that you as an organization can be efficient in getting things out the door, and that's what I think SAFe was trying to do, but it's not working because it's not solving the problems of the product management and it's not solving that problem of connecting the value back to the product teams. Instead, it's seen as a role that almost babysits developers or tells everybody what to do. Where's the discovery? Where do those things come in? I know with the SAFe image that we got over here, they try to drop things like Lean UX in there, which Jeff Gothelf thinks it's hilarious, but it's not really pulling it all together of how do we do this on a cadence? How do we help people go out there and actually talk to customers? How do we enable them to do it?

(00:45:15):
If you're starting a transformation, it's not just thinking about how do we build the product, but you should also be thinking about how do we launch the product and how do we make sure this is the right product to do. That's the big pieces of it, and that's where all that product strategy comes in. You should also look at the career paths. This is what really bothers me about agile transformations and what bothers me with Scrum and SAFe is that when we organized in these large organizations into agile teams, we made all these new roles called a product owner, and so many organizations don't have a career path for them so they email me and they go, "What's my career path? What do I do next? Where am I supposed to go?"

(00:45:59):
I've been saying for 10 years, this is not a team role, it's not just a team role, it's a business role and it rolls all the way up to helping you further your business. You have to make sure that people on teams can be promoted to running multiple teams, can be promoted to running an entire product line. To us, that's so simple in Silicon Valley native software companies, but it's still unheard of in other organizations. What happens too, and this is where I think leadership and C-suite needs to really pay attention, because we're transforming in this way of working, what happens is some of the roles that we had before do not serve us now. Maybe we don't need a million project managers, maybe people in the business who decided what we're going to build, are they the right people to bring with us on this next phase into product management? Can they learn? Can they grok software? Do they understand those pieces? That's what we have to ask.

(00:46:58):
Organizations are so afraid sometimes to put these career ladders in because it kind of overhauls their traditional ways of working, and then they've got people who've been in these organizations for 40 years and now you're saying, "Hey, you're actually not in charge of that, the product manager is in charge of that," and that's scary. A lot of them get in the way because of that. If you really want to transform though, the C-suite has to be like, "Hey, we're going in this direction," and just put it down because I've seen it run by a lot of middle managers, a transformation run by tons of middle managers, and those are the jobs that are usually in most jeopardy when you start transforming and you have to re-skill and you have to figure out what to do, and they don't want to do that. They're not going to be the ones who jump up and down and say, "Hey, let's do this."

(00:47:41):
There's a lot of people out there, I think, pushing organizations to try harder and to internally as well. I've worked with a lot of people who run these transformations who just really want it to work, and I think they do it with the best of intentions, but the C-suite has to understand this is not just a transformation project, this is a whole new way of working, and if we want a whole new way of working, we have to really rise to that occasion.

(00:49:13):
There's a few things I want to pull out from what you just shared. One is, just to clarify, you recommend not using SAFe, you don't think that's a good approach?

Melissa Perri (00:49:21):
I do not recommend using SAFe. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:24):
Great.

Melissa Perri (00:49:25):
There are people who like SAFe. Let me just say this, there are people who found success with SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who like SAFe found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else. It's not actually SAFe by the book. If you do that, fine, that's any process. If you ended up adopting SAFe and you want to go back and look at it and say, "Actually let's just get rid of all the stuff that's not working and keep the stuff that is," fine, but being open to understanding this is not the way that we do good product management. There's not a lot in SAFe about doing good product management. That's the stuff that we have to understand. It could help in certain areas, and I do think it does help in certain areas, bring some rigor to things, but if you take it too far, it will destroy things.

(00:50:17):
There's actually a great story about a water company in the Netherlands and they decided to adopt SAFe, and this was on the news a couple months ago. They decided to adopt SAFe in their IT teams and start working with it. They ended up going bankrupt, and the reason they ended up going bankrupt is because the teams were learning the processes for SAFe, they were taking so long to deploy their new invoicing system and payment collections that they couldn't collect payments from customers because they got so caught up in the process.

(00:50:53):
That's what I see happen a lot in these organizations. Instead of talking about what's really important, which is, "Hey, how are we serving our customers? How are we winning in this market? How do we stem churn? How do we do all these things?", we're talking instead about, "What stand-ups are we doing? Oh, how do we do this release planning? Oh, my God, you guys didn't sprint back to back, you did it wrong." We're talking about work about work, but we're not actually getting into what are we achieving here, and that's the part I do not like about rigid processes when it comes to this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):
That touches on the other theme I wanted to bring up is it feels like the stuff is a kind of replacement for skilled, talented people, a product leader that understands how to do these things and has product taste and has organized teams to build great product. It feels like people are just, "We don't have that so we're going to create this. This process is going to fix all our problems." Can you talk about just the importance of that, the people you hire to run these things as key to this, if that's true?

Melissa Perri (00:52:00):
In a lot of organizations, the people who buy SAFe, they have not run large scale technology organizations before, or they're new to this way of working so they adopt SAFe and they hope it works because it looks like a nice plan, like we said, to go out and do things. When you're doing a transformation, a lot of companies are pulling people into these roles for the first time. I've said since day one that I've been working with companies, it's okay and I think it's noble to want to train people and put them in different roles. Cool. If you're going to spend money upskilling your people, do that, but you also have to intersperse people who know what they're doing. I think at leadership it's really important to bring in somebody who knows what they're doing to help run this type of thing.

(00:52:44):
There are more people out there and more leaders who have done this before because we've been doing this for 10 years. There's Shruti Patel, she's chief product officer at US Bank for small business banking. I just had her on the podcast. She worked at Shopify, she saw how great teams worked, and then she was able to come and help apply that at a bank. She's experienced, right? She's an experienced product person who comes in to help. Melissa Douros is the CPO of Green Dot Bank and she had worked at Discover Financial leading the transformation there, did all that work, and then could bring it to Green Dot Bank. She can see what needs to happen, what needs to actually go on here.

(00:53:23):
We've got more and more people out there who have done this before who are looking for these opportunities to do it in the bank, and I think it's important for C-suite to bring them in to actually look at that. Where I've seen transformations be the most successful in all these organizations is when you do that mix, you keep some of your people, but you also bring people in to learn. I get hired all the time to come in and train. I've worked with almost every Fortune 50 company at this point, fortune 100 company too, and I get in, I come in to train a lot of product managers. We do it through Product Institute and we'll train everybody. What used to happen about eight years ago is they train everybody and they would say, "Go." Where do you go after you bring in the consultants to do training to keep learning? How do they watch other people in the organization do great product management if there's nobody in the organization who's done it before?

(00:54:20):
Luckily I think a lot of organizations are realizing that, so more leaders are out there who are saying, "Hey, I've got to actually intersperse skills here. I need to bring in some more directors who are experienced here, some more individual contributors who are experienced here." Those organizations I think are wildly successful because they recognize it and they say, "I've got to make sure that people can learn from others." That's how you keep developing, that's how we all keep developing, it's not just doing all external classes. That's where I think these things become powerful. You could do that at all levels. You don't have to just do it with the teams, you could do it at director level, you could do it at VP level. That's how we should be thinking about this.

(00:54:57):
Now, there are some CPOs out there and some VPs of product in these large organizations who are new to this way of working, but they've committed themselves to learning and to trying to figure out how to do it best. They're not saying, "Hey, I'm just going to adopt SAFe or I'm just going to do whatever is over here," they're actually saying, "What don't I know?" I'm watching them go out to talk to other CPOs, do all these other things. They usually have great market knowledge, great business knowledge, and they're fantastic at strategy, and then they hire people underneath them who are great at the other pieces like the execution and getting the software at the door. I think those people are successful in it as well because they notice their skill gaps and they hire for it just like any great leader would.

(00:55:41):
In these organizations, I do see sometimes SAFe for something being a crutch for people who don't know what they're doing to bring in. If you really think about, "Hey, how do I make this better?", and have that continuous learning mindset and that way to want to propel this forward, I think you'll consider other options and start to think about broader than just SAFe, broader than just agile, what do we need to make this successful?

(00:56:07):
The key part of this too is recognizing that product management is not just this role in Scrum. I say this in my talk too, I say Take Scrum away. You still need product management, right? Product owner doesn't exist without Scrum, that's not a thing, but you still need product managers and that's why all product owners should be product managers, they should be fundamentally product managers. That's why I do not like these career trajectories that keep them separate. Sure, if you want to have a principal IC product manager like they do in a lot of large Silicon Valley companies, perfect, let people keep working on those things. They don't have to go into management, but that doesn't mean they're different. Between an IC product owner and an IC product manager, it shouldn't be different there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):
Perfect segue to where I wanted to go next, which is say you are a product owner today listening to this and you're like, "Man, this is exactly my life. What can I do?", what's your advice to folks in that role right now about how to potentially become product managers, build the skills they need to not just be stuck in this career path that doesn't go anywhere?

Melissa Perri (00:57:14):
Yeah. I think the first thing is bringing awareness to that your role is more than just working with the developers. A lot of leaders argue with me that we need product owners because it just doesn't scale. You've seen massive companies at scale where they don't have any product owners. I do not understand that. It's a weak argument to me, it's a very weak argument. It just means you don't know how to distribute the work evenly and give a little bit of strategic guidance to product owners so that they can gon, or product managers, on a team so that they can go and build visions and cut down features and stuff like that. If you're a product owner and you're like, "Hey, I don't have the opportunity to talk to customers, my product manager does that. I am just working with the teams. I want to be more strategic, I want to think longer term," I'd say try to take some ownership over that and push back on the things that are being given to you.

(00:58:04):
I was doing a workshop for Mind the Product back in the day, and I had a product owner in my workshop and she said, "I don't think that things we're working on," they were doing SAFe, "are the right things to work on." I said, "You should bring this to your manager," and she was like, "I don't know. I'm going to get fired. I don't think it's the right thing. What am I going to work on if we're not going to work on this?" I'm like, "Well, this is the beauty of product instead of project, we stay with the product." Just because your project ends doesn't mean that you lose a job. She put together this whole thing, went and said, "I don't think we should be working on this," and they promoted her. They were like, "Fantastic." She took this leap of faith and went out there and started saying, "This is more. We need to do more."

(00:58:44):
I think if you're a product owner and there's no career path for you, start asking leaders what your career path is because it's going to make them go, "Oh, great question. What should the career path be?" There's a lot of literature out there about how we make career paths, so you can start there. Ask what's next for you after this product owner role. I would ask the product managers if they're doing all the customer research, see if you can do some customer research with them. Go sit in on this. A lot of them will say, "I don't have time. I don't have time to do this." Strip back all the user stories you're working on, stop thinking about it as a quantitative metric that needs to just go up and up. Instead, really think about the value you're delivering with your team. Is this the right thing?

(00:59:24):
When you talk to leaders and when you present your case, you say it in a way of, "Hey, I'm working on X, Y, and Z feature. What's the goal here? When we release this, what do we hope will happen?" I think that's one of the best questions anybody can ask if they're worried their company is not focused on outcomes. What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change? How do we instrument it to make sure that's true? Then we can go back and actually see if it changed. One simple question to get alignment on it, and then you can start to say, "Oh, that didn't work or this did work." Great. Why did it work? You can open up those conversations.

(01:00:00):
I'd say there's a lot of things you can do to help move your companies forward, and I have seen in a lot of these organizations too, a groundswell of product owners and product managers saying, "Hey, what's next for me? What's going on?" That makes the organizations go and figure it out. I was working with one Fortune 10 company not too long ago, their C-suite, I've been working with them for a very long time and they're finally like, "Hey, we're going to codify the product manager role and we're going to have it all the way up and down our organization, we're going to make roles, we're going to make responsibilities." To me, that was music to my ears, but the reason they were doing it too is because they noticed there was a lot of churn in the organization in that role, and they also realized it's a critical role.

(01:00:44):
They're losing good people because people from the outside are coming because they want to work for this great big organization that's doing super well, fantastic, but they get in there and they go, "Where's my career path? What am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go?" A lot of leaders are out there now realizing, "Hey, we do have to get our stuff together," and the only reason they're coming to this conclusion as well is because they're looking around seeing other people doing it and they hear it from the teams, they hear it from the product managers. I don't want people to think, "Hey, I have no power. I'm in a 10,000 person organization." The more you bring this up, the more your leaders will respect it because they don't want to lose you, they don't want to lose good people. If you want to be great at your job and you need more support there, speak up, speak up.

(01:01:31):
At a certain point, I do tell people this. If you feel like you can't do great product management in your organization, try to find another organization. I know that is hard to say and I respect people are tied to insurances and it's hard to change jobs, but if you do have the opportunity to look for another organization that does it well, I would go there. I would also say in large corporations too, I've seen certain business lines and certain divisions do it super well and then others not. If you are in a large corporation, maybe think about moving internally, laterally to a different team and seeing if you can work there. I'd find the leaders who know what they're doing and go work for that. That's usually the best move here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:11):
The point you made about how a lot of companies don't have any product owners and have scaled very wide, just to reinforce that in the data dive that we did on job market trends, no tech company has a product owner basically, no top tech company. I know there's an important distinction here. These are tech, software first, product first businesses where their business is the software they're building, and a lot of the companies we're talking about here are not that. They're banks and telecoms, pharmaceutical companies. I get that it's a very different world, but I think it's important to highlight, "You can become very big." Google has no product owners as far as I know, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, no company you've heard of that's a tech company has a product owner. They're all product managers, they're all product managers.

Melissa Perri (01:02:56):
Yeah. I don't want people to think that there aren't people who build great software in these large corporations too because there are. There's pockets of people who are doing it super, super well. If you are one of those people who's been pushing the boundaries, doing great work, and your title is a product owner, what I always tell people on your resume, if you're looking for your next job so that you're not pushed out, let's say, of these large corporations like a Google or somewhere like that, and that's where you want to work in a tech firm, make sure you describe how you did your job from a value perspective. Do not talk about your agile cadences. Get Scrum out of there. Talk about what value you brought to the users and what metrics you moved, and that's how your resume should be laid out.

(01:03:40):
I do read tons of resumes to hire people, and also chief product officer, same thing. If I see immediately implemented Scrum processes across the organization, I'm like, "No, that's not what I need. That's not what I was looking for." I was looking for what are you going to do to push the strategy in that part of the organization? What are you going to do to actually build better products for customers? Then when you get into the interview, you can talk about what things you did to do that, but you want to make sure that you're focused on really understanding the customer and translating that into great products, and the outcomes that we were looking for when you do it on your resume, I think that's important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
Okay. I want to spend more time here because this is so important. This is highlighting here's the difference between a product owner and a product manager. If you want to move into product management and become a great PM, if you're a product owner today, even if you're not a product owner and just want to get into product management, can you again just highlight here's the big difference and here's the skills that people value most in a PM versus a product owner.

Melissa Perri (01:04:38):
Yeah. When I see product owners write out their resumes or describe their job functions, they always approach it from a process standpoint. I prioritize the backlog, I worked with the developers to break down the work, I checked the developer's work and did the acceptance criteria, I wrote the user stories, all those functions is what I see over and over and over again in product owner resume. What you want to do instead is say, "I led the," we can even do the login API,"I led the work around the login API. The problem that I was solving around it was trying to enhance security for our login protocols to meet regulatory requirements. I interviewed a bunch of users, I got up to speed on the regulatory requirements, I worked really closely with our legal teams and our compliance teams to translate that into something that was going to secure our bank, and when we launched, we were able to meet our compliance, save our bank a couple million dollars, and we smoothly transitioned into these new security requirements without disrupting any service for customers for four million customers."

(01:05:40):
Way different story than I prioritized backlog and I shipped it off to developers. Take it a step further. If you're working on customer-facing things, who are your customers? Did you go out and talk to them? By interfacing with customers and understanding them, I was able to solve XY, and Z problem with them, which resulted in a measurable amount of XY and Z metric going up for the business. I ran this function, I ran this feature, I launched this feature, I watched it through, I iterated on it, I did the stuff that was needed to make this successful. That's what I want to see on a resume.

(01:06:15):
Even if you have a product owner title, I'll still read the details and everybody else will too, but I will say there's sometimes a poor connotation when you have that title unfortunately because of the baggage that's associated with agile. Even just on resumes, I would say do product owner/product manager in there just to let people know that I know how to do this and I've been doing this well. If you do that in your bullet points, that shows up as well. There's also this whole concept that we didn't even get into about certifications. People keep asking me if I want to transition into product management, should I get a certification, an agile certification?" I feel like these were bigger a couple years ago, but they're still big. If you ever see somebody with a CSPO on the end of their profile, which you probably have seen on LinkedIn, it's a certified Scrum product owner.

(01:07:05):
Now, one thing to remember, and this is about all agile stuff, is we call it the agile industrial complex, agile coaches and agile trainers, the whole Scrum team, scrum.org, Scrum Inc, SAFe, everybody, the way they make their money is through consulting to teach you these processes and by having people be trained to get these certifications. They come in and they say, "All your people need to be certified Scrum product owners. Give me 2,500 bucks per person," and then they get a certificate at the end of a two-day class that says they're a certified Scrum product owner. It doesn't necessarily mean they could do the job, it doesn't necessarily mean they could do product management, but let's think about when we're talking about too should we adopt SAFe in general, should we adopt these things, think about how these organizations make money.

(01:07:56):
They're selling certifications. Of course they want more and more people to adopt it. That's the idea here. They're selling you this dream that you just certify all your people and then you could be working on it. They take all these people, they put them in two-day classes or whatever, and they turn them out and then they say, "Go, you're a completely new role." It doesn't work that way. That's not in the best interest of your company, that's not really what we're looking for here, and that's why all of this stuff needs to go deeper. If you've done a CSPO class and you have that certification, it may help you get hired at another large enterprise that is adopting Scrum and SAFe. That will probably help you there.

(01:08:36):
If you want to transition into tech and go into the companies that we talk about, they're probably going to look at that and say, "This person doesn't know what they're doing. This is not here." If you do know what you're doing and you did that for a reason, because some people need that to get promoted, some companies actually require it, which is crazy, but to get promoted or be that thing, I have tremendous sympathy for that, but you're going to have to do a lot of work explaining in your resumes and stuff as you transition that you know more than that. You're not just a CSPO with a two-day class, you have done the work. That's where all of this building up on your resume becomes really, really important. It's not just about getting certified.

(01:09:14):
I had people ask me, they're like, "Can you just certify product managers?" I'm like, "No. If people take my course, I give them a certificate of completion and as a completion." You finished a course just like any other course, but I will not certify product managers because I do not think you can ever say somebody is prepared and able to do their job from a short class. Now, there are some agile agencies that do a lot more training where you have different levels, and what they would do is they would train people, but then they would make them go do work and they had a coach that they worked with, and they go back and forth and they could demonstrate that they could do the work over time to get to the next level.

(01:09:56):
It's almost like the PMP, the project management certification where you have to have time actually doing the job. That's different, that's a different type of skill, it's a different type of certification, but if you see any CSPOs, it's typically a two-day workshop that they went to and then got certified. That's the difference with this. I would say be careful if you are a product owner wanting to be a product manager of just certifications. All the large tech organizations I know too, they're not looking for certifications in product management or product ownership to hire people, they're looking for experience, but the organizations that might not know what they're doing, they are looking for CSPOs, they are looking for that.

(01:10:37):
If it's required by your organization, you might have to ask, "Are we all well set up here to do our best job? Is this the place where I'm going to learn how to be a better product manager?" I also feel bad though for people because it's hard to be a product manager, it's hard to get your foot in the door. I'm so torn on it because there are organizations that hire people with a CSPO and they require it, so of course if it gets your foot in the door and it helps you do it, but if it's not going to help you and it's not going to put you on the career path you want, I don't think it's worth money.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):
I think one interesting thread throughout this whole conversation is rarely is a plug-in play-ish easy solution going to be the answer to your problem, whether it's plugging in SAFe and it's going to help us build great software, taking a class helping you become a great product manager, be skeptical of that.

Melissa Perri (01:11:31):
Yeah. There's no quick way to doing any of this, there's no fast track. You don't get to skip over all the hard things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):
Yeah. Bummer.

Melissa Perri (01:11:41):
Yeah. I wish.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:43):
Yeah. One question I wanted to clarify. When you come into an org and they have product owners, do you encourage them to get rid of product owner as a title and role and make them product managers or do you keep product owners?

Melissa Perri (01:11:53):
I say that we should have a hierarchy. You would have all product managers on a team, they would be an IC, individual contributor, so they're either an associate product manager and that's if they don't have all the discovery experience or maybe they know basic Scrum, totally fine, you can be an associate product manager, but if they don't know how to talk to customers, digest what the customers are saying and turn that into a feature direction and a backlog and this is how we're going to work, all that stuff needs to be in there. If they don't know how they should be measuring things, you're not quite a product manager yet.

(01:12:28):
Associate product manager, and then product manager, and then a senior PM. A senior PM can work on a Scrum team as well or a development team. I do encourage them, I say, "Get rid of these two different titles because it's confusing everybody." I help a lot of people with career paths too. I've seen companies with 47 different titles for product managers because somebody in this organization is called a product associate and somebody over here is a product manager and that person is a platform product manager, and that person is a platform product owner, and this person is an API product owner. You can have product manager, senior product manager, all that stuff, but I would not confuse people with the two different titles of product owner versus product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):
But importantly, there's a bar for who is called a product manager because if you take a product owner as you've said, and say you're a product manager, they're going to be a terrible product manager. Your advice is make them an associate PM, and then once they reach a certain level, they've graduated to product manager.

Melissa Perri (01:13:28):
It depends. I don't say this as a hard and fast rule because there are product owners out there who've been doing their job very well. Just because they have a title of a product owner doesn't mean that somebody can't do the job of a product manager. There are plenty of people out there who were just named this because a company names them that and they know what they're doing, so don't look at that hard and fast. When we do this, we typically will say everybody's got product owner on their title, change it to product manager, but we will go back and look at what is the actual skillset.

(01:13:56):
When I've come in to work with companies on transformations, what we typically do, the way I get introduced usually is we come in and they're looking for some kind of training for all of their product teams, and then we bring in Product Institute and we do our online training, Then afterwards I work with the organization, I say, "Now that everybody's been baselined and trained, we have to figure out who is going to be a great product manager and who's not," so there's an awareness. You know what's interesting? Once people figure out what the job's about, a lot of them opt out.

(01:14:24):
When I did the transformation at Athenahealth, we had 365 product managers and they all had different titles too, product innovation, all over the place. We turned them into product managers, we trained everybody, we gave everybody the opportunity to learn, which I think is great, and then we gave them opportunity to practice their skills. What happened is at the end of the training, a lot of people raised their hand and said, "Oh, no, no, this is not what I wanted to do. I thought it was very different. I did not realize how much people work it was. I have to go influence these people, I have to do all this stuff. This is actually not really what I wanted to do."

(01:14:59):
We found other roles for them that were what they wanted to do or they decided to leave. That was up to them, we didn't cut anybody, but we moved some people into operations because they wanted to be a little more heads down to find process. That was their thing. We moved people into data roles who were good with SQL and were good with data analysis. We moved people into user research roles because they wanted to talk to customers, but they didn't want the responsibility and the accountability that came with the product management piece because they realized it was so intense.

(01:15:29):
I've seen this happen a lot in large organizations. You baseline everybody, you show them what the role is and then you let them go practice it, and then at that point some people will opt out and then you have to go back through your people and say, "Okay. How do we level-set now? Who's doing really well? Who's not doing so well? Which teams need to have more experienced people on it because they don't have anybody to learn from?" That's where we would say, "Hey, let's hire some ICs over here or a director of product management who can help train these people and help them keep growing." That's been super successful. I've seen people bring in some more directors, scattered them around, and they've leveled up these product owners who were not necessarily doing great product management and now they're doing fantastic.

(01:16:13):
I've watched fantastic leaders in these organizations that are not software native or doing these transformations. Bringing the right person, you can make amazing product managers. Give them a year or two and completely turn it around. It's totally possible. It's totally possible to take people and train them, and I firmly believe in that, but you got to get them exposure to what good looks like. If you are in an organization and you cannot see what good looks like anywhere, that's a red flag. That's where leaders need to look at their organization and say, "Do I have people with these skills interspersed around so that everybody can start to learn, so that everybody can actually be on the uptake of this and make sure that we are well-balanced?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:56):
That was an awesome nuance and addition. I'm just looking back at all the things we've talked about. We've covered so much ground, the history of agile and Scrum and SAFes and product owners, we've gotten into all kinds of advice on how to do this better as a company leader, as a product owner, as someone thinking about even moving through product management. Is there anything else that we have not covered that you think might be helpful to touch on or wrap up on?

Melissa Perri (01:17:25):
I think I would tell people to remember that when you look at agile methodologies, and if you look at it with small agile, what we are really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well, but if you think of agile as just a defined super cut and dry process where you have to follow every single little step here and there, that's not going to serve you because you're not getting back into why are we doing this.

(01:17:54):
There are some great agile coaches out there. There are first principle approaches to doing great product work and doing great development work. They're there because they are not just selling Scrum, they are there to make people better. Those agile coaches I think can make great fantastic teams, and I've worked with a lot of them, and I think they are really there to just make it a better environment for the people who are working and to help the company produce better products. That's their whole goal.

(01:18:21):
Then there are people too who are wedded to this is SAFe and you will do it by the book. This is Scrum, you will do it by the book. I'd be very skeptical of that because what's the end goal? What's their end goal? Like I said, a lot of people out there get paid by certifying people and by consulting on these processes. McKinsey made a huge division to do this, and a lot of SAFe was actually introduced to organizations from McKinsey and from large organizations, consulting organizations like that. They came in and they said, "Yeah, this is what you do. I'll teach you how to do SAFe, I'll teach you how to do Scrum." They have been building those consulting agencies off of agile transformations.

(01:19:03):
We always laugh when I talk to other people who've been doing transformations and coaches. I go, "Why is McKinsey always coming in here and doing this?" I've followed them into so many organizations and I've been like, "Oh, wow, they screwed this up. Let me go fix it." There's always a saying that nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey. McKinsey's big, people trust their name. A lot of the people at McKinsey haven't done this before, they've never been inside the organization trying to transform it and stay there for a long time. That's why I'd be really skeptical of who's selling that.

(01:19:37):
If you approach agile from a perspective of I want to be agile because I want to release things quickly and get feedback from customers and make sure that that's great, look at all of your processes like that and say, "Is that serving the best interest of our company and our culture and our customers? Is this making our customers proud of us? Is this helping our customers receive good value?" If your processes aren't, fix them, change them, inspect and adapt, ease a lowercase agile principle. We should be looking at every process we do and saying, "Is it working?", and not be afraid to change it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):
I think it's important to highlight this can work. There are ways to reorganize the way you build product at a very large company where you can actually deliver great product consistently. You've seen that happen a lot. Anything you want to add there to give people hope?

Melissa Perri (01:20:30):
Yeah. The biggest pushback I hear from large organizations, especially ones that are not software native as banks or insurance companies, whatever it is, is that we're not like Google, we're not like SaaS companies. It's true, you're not a SaaS company. The way that you do it is going to be slightly different than the way that Amazon runs or the way that Google runs. I don't see many companies actually run the same, and just because it works at Google doesn't mean it's going to work at an insurance company that's a hundred years old. That's okay, but you could still learn from people who've been producing software at scale for many, many years. You can still learn what makes them successful, and then you could take some of those principles and apply them to your organization and then figure out where we need to adapt. That's what I would look at.

(01:21:21):
I see software strategies and digital strategies becoming so intertwined into the strategies of companies in general, whether you're an insurance company or a bank or anything. They're becoming so heavily entwined in the C-suite strategies. The first thing I would say, and where I see a lot of companies struggle with this is you have to make sure that it is thought of at the C-suite. What some organizations do is go, "Oh, no, that's IT work. Let me push all the software strategy down." If you're doing that, you're missing out on innovation, and this is where the product role comes in and where I think more organizations need chief product officers because they're the person in the C-suite saying, "How can software enable us to be 10 times better and crush our competition, whether we're a bank or insurance company or a pharmaceutical company? What can we do with our software that's going to put us ahead of the competition, that's going to put us ahead of the market?"

(01:22:16):
If you're not having those conversations when you're thinking of your long-term company strategy, you're behind, you're behind because that is what every small high-growth startup is doing that's coming out to try to disrupt these big companies. The big companies are successful, they have a lot of money so they don't have as much urgency as sometimes these smaller companies do to change or somebody who's failing to change. That's why things are going so slow, but at the same time, if we don't pay attention to that and we're not considering it, that's where the danger comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
I imagine people are going to have a lot of questions and hope to get even more advice. A couple of final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask more questions along these lines, maybe get your help on some of this stuff? Then finally, how can listeners be useful to you, Melissa.

Melissa Perri (01:23:02):
You can find me on LinkedIn. If you go search for Melissa Perri with an I, P-E-R-R-I, you'll find me there. My LinkedIn is /melissajeanPerri. I'm happy to connect with people there. My school is called Product Institute, so if you're interested in doing product management training or getting help with some of this stuff, go to productinstitute.com and reach out to me. I run a podcast too called The Product Thinking Podcast. We answer questions every week, and a lot of them are around SAFe, agile and all these topics, so if you have a question and you're saying, "Hey, how do I do this?", definitely reach out and let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Awesome. Melissa, I learned a lot. I feel like a lot of people who listen to this podcast, they're like, "I had no idea about any of this, and now I understand all these terms that I kind of hear occasionally." Thank you for coming and sharing all of this with us, especially the advice for folks that are in this world right now.

Melissa Perri (01:23:49):
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

# The ultimate guide to product operations | Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles

## Transcript

Melissa Perri (00:00:00):
Do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?

Lenny (00:00:25):
Today, my guests are Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles. This is a rare two-guest episode. Melissa and Denise are authors of an awesome new book called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational handbook, Escaping the Build Trap. She runs a product management training organization called Produx Labs, teaches product management at Harvard, and has worked with hundreds of companies on their product management function. Denise is a product leader, coach, and consultant helping companies with their product vision, strategy, and execution, and works with Melissa at Produx Labs. 

(00:01:02):
In our conversation, we get super deep into the emerging role of product ops. As you'll hear in our conversation, over the past few years, this role has gone from almost non-existent to something like half of scaling tech companies with at least one product ops person. This new role is probably the thing that's most changing in the role of product management. After this conversation, I'm convinced it's a great thing. 

(00:01:24):
We chat about what the role concretely is, how it differs from product management and project management, what to look for in your first product ops hire, how to roll out a product ops function, why product managers shouldn't be afraid of this role and how your life gets significantly better, plus, a case study on how they rolled out product ops function at a large company, and so much more. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles after a short word from our sponsor.

(00:01:50):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets.

(00:03:13):
Melissa and Denise, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Denise Tilles (00:03:17):
Thank you. 

Melissa Perri (00:03:18):
Thanks for having us.

Lenny (00:03:19):
You are the second ever guest duo I've had on the podcast. Melissa, this is your second appearance on the podcast, and you two have a new book out, which I have right here. It's called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. What I want to do with our time today is to help people fully understand the role of product operations from every direction as much as we can get through in an hour. How does that sound?

Melissa Perri (00:03:44):
Sounds great. 

Denise Tilles (00:03:44):
Great.

Melissa Perri (00:03:45):
Let's do it. 

Lenny (00:03:45):
Awesome. So first question, just to set a little context on this role, how popular and how common is the role at this point? I did a quick skim of just awesome companies and really successful companies, and every single one of them seems to have a product ops role at this point. OpenAI, Uber, Stripe, Ramp, Deal, those are just the few that I looked at. Is that what you're seeing? How should people think about how popular and how common this role has become?

Melissa Perri (00:04:12):
I think over the last few years, we definitely have seen product operations start booming. It did originate in a lot of big companies that you mentioned too like Uber. The head of product operations at Uber and the person who started it, Blake Samic, is a case study in our book and he also did it at Stripe and he does it at OpenAI. So it's pretty funny that you mentioned those three because that's Blake right there who did that. We have seen a very good transition from people whispering about product operations, and I know when I wrote my first book, Escaping the Build Trap, in 2018 I mentioned it in there because we had just started doing it at Athenahealth. 

(00:04:49):
I saw this as a really big issue in trying to make a complete product management function there and especially at scale. We had 365 product teams. We were trying to figure out how does this all come together, and product operations for me was a key part of it. So when I had first written it into that book, a lot of people were like, "Oh, what is this thing? I think we need it. Do we need more?" and that's what got us to start writing this book. Since then, I've seen a lot more companies coming out and either making more mature product operations teams that started probably before that or actually introducing them now.

Lenny (00:05:21):
I guess maybe thinking about just tech companies, if you had to put a number on some rough percentage of interesting fast-growing, hyper growth, these startups, is there a percentage you'd put on how many of them have a product ops person at this point?

Melissa Perri (00:05:34):
We don't have a hard and fast number, I'll say that on this, but we have seen that. Let's take a sampling of maybe something that I know better. When I teach CPO accelerator, when I teach people in these cohorts, out of the 20, 25 people that we'll have in a cohort, I'd say at least half of them have somebody doing something product ops related. It might not be a mature function, it might just be one person on it, but at least half of them have somebody doing something.

Denise Tilles (00:06:06):
That's a good yardstick because I teach a product operations masterclass for Produx Labs with Melissa, and it's been interesting. I do some pre-work and try to understand where folks are in the products journey. When we started offering this class in 2020, about 60% were products curious. As time has gone on, it's really gone down and people have started to add it. They just want to understand what's the best way to optimize it. So I would say it's gone from that level to, say, probably 60% of them do have it now and then want to understand how to optimize it.

Lenny (00:06:41):
Do you have a sense of when this started to inflect and become such a common thing? When I was a product manager, I had no product ops person. So it's really fascinating to me to learn about this emergence. I know there's probably not a date, but just it sounds like maybe after your last book was published. Is there a timeframe of this became a thing? Is it this guy you mentioned that's now at OpenAI that started spreading it? 

Melissa Perri (00:07:01):
Blake, I think, was one of the people at the beginning who was talking about it the most and he's done a lot of work, I think, to push product operations and tell people about it. So that was great. I know Pendo has been speaking about product ops a little bit more and that's where I started to notice that it was picking up steam. I think around 2019 is when Pendo started talking about product operations. So it was roughly right after my book came out that I saw more people speaking about it and now they're trying to figure out, "Do we standardize it? What do we need? How does this actually look like in organizations?" but I think it's been probably a good five years of now hearing people doing it in realtime.

Lenny (00:07:41):
Awesome, and it sounds like maybe just in the last few years it started to really take off. We actually had Christine from Pendo on the podcast talking about product ops about a year ago at this point. So this is a great followup to a lot of that. Before we talk about what is product ops and what are the functions, what would you say are the biggest benefits to a company having a product ops role and also just what's a sign that you should probably seriously consider bringing on a product ops person and starting to invest in that area?

Denise Tilles (00:08:08):
It's really about helping the product managers focus on what they were actually hired for, the strategic work. In my role on the operating side and managing teams and Melissa as well, more and more product managers are taking on the data, harvesting the data, implementation and just to get data to work with, they're spending 20%, 30% of their time. So what would that look like if they were enabled and had all of those great inputs to actually focus on company growth, achieving the value, achieving the scaling goals that the company had? So it's really about helping them focus on what they were hired for.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Again, when I was a PM, I had no product ops person, and having read your book, basically all the things product ops does is stuff PMs historically have done. To me, it's scary to give up all those things and put them on someone else's plate. There's the ideal of, "Oh, amazing, I don't have to do all these things. I'll focus on things I really get excited about," but there's also this new fear of, "Oh, someone else is going to take these things and maybe they won't do as well. There's this new process I have to think about. There's new lines of communication." So what's your biggest pitch to a product manager starting to hear about product ops and this fear of like, "Oh, man, my job is going to be weird. This new person I have to deal with all the time. I used to do all these things." How do you help a PM get excited about this?

Melissa Perri (00:09:30):
Product operations does not take away decision making rights from the product manager. It's there to inform them. So if you're judging your success as a product manager of, "Hey, I do the SQL queries and I have to spend the 50 hours to set up all these customer interviews and calls," that to me is very operational process type work, but it's not work that's going to help you make a decision about your product. That's why we're looking at the product operations team because what I've seen is product managers doing this off the side of their desk like me too. I got excited about this because when I was at OpenSky in early days of my product management career, I had to go learn MongoDB to get data out of a database. I was sitting through a MongoDB class learning how to do this. I knew SQL, but we did not use the SQL database then. I had to go learn MongoDB so I would stop bothering the engineers to be able to actually just measure if my products and my features were doing anything correct. 

(00:10:27):
That was a lot of time that I spent doing that instead of spending it on good feature work and on understanding my customers and working with my developers and figuring out what we were actually going to build, instead I'm out here learning this programming language, which I never used again, by the way. Never used it again after that. That to me is the stuff that product ops takes away from the product managers. 

(00:10:51):
What I constantly hear from product managers though is, "I am so busy, I don't have time to do the things that I need to do correctly. I'm so busy trying to line up customer interviews," or, "I'm so busy just trying to get data out of systems. I'm fighting these fights to get the things that I need to do my job correctly that I don't have time to do my job correctly," and that's what we're trying to help them with. So I wouldn't be afraid that product ops is coming in here. It's not supposed to be something that's providing more overhead. It's supposed to be something that's a little more liberating and helps free you up from all the busy work.

Lenny (00:11:26):
That's a great pitch. I always thought product management is an insane role with way too much going on, and that's why everyone's always burnt out and stressed. There's just so many things you have to do. So I totally get how this is happening and why this is happening. I love that you're helping people figure out how to actually do it well. Let's actually get into what the role actually is. I think it's a really confusing role. A lot of people hear product ops and everyone know what it is. There's maybe research synthesis, there's some data stuff. What's the simplest way to think about what is the general consistent roles of a product ops person and what they can do for your company?

Denise Tilles (00:12:03):
The way we think about it is structured around the three pillars that we talk about in the book, so business and data insights, more of the quantitative side, making sure that the product manager has all of these engagement and revenue inputs to make smart decisions, the customer market insights, so the qualitative. We talked about this a little bit earlier in terms of finding folks to speak to, making sure you're speaking to more than one just customer. Finally, the third pillar is process and practices. So it's really around those areas and it depends on what your company needs and where the biggest opportunities and challenges might be.

Lenny (00:12:43):
Awesome. So the three, just to reshare what you just said, the three pillars of product ops, business, data and insights, customer and market insights and the process of how you build product and helping the business operate more effectively in the way they build product.

Denise Tilles (00:13:00):
Sounds great when you say it. Yes.

Lenny (00:13:03):
I have the notes and this is exactly described in your book, so well-described. Is there one of these three that you find most important, impactful? Is it really dependent on the business and their needs or what the PM wants to do? How do you think about, I don't know, which of these three is maybe most important or is it a super dependent?

Melissa Perri (00:13:20):
So we usually see that high growth companies start with business data and insights and make sure that they can actually monitor what they're doing and get the strategic inputs. We see larger companies and enterprises go more towards the process and governance, especially if they're in, let's say, a transformation because they don't have the infrastructure to run good product. Let's say it's that way. They're usually just starting out, they're just forming their teams. Let's say they just trained product managers and now they're like, "What else do we need to do besides just training product managers to make this work?" So they need an operating model and they typically don't have a product operating model. 

(00:13:58):
In that case, they're looking at even just, "How do we do roadmaps across the organization so that I as a chief product officer or VP of product can actually just have transparency into what my teams are doing?" Jira does not work for that. You need a portfolio tool to be able to roll that up into something that makes sense. Again, that helps me as a VP now or a CPO make strategic decisions and it helps me monitor my teams and understand, "Are we actually spending money on the right things? Are we doing the right work?" So they tend to do it more on the process and governance side, but it's all in service of being able to make rapid strategic decisions and get good products out there to the world.

Lenny (00:14:40):
That's a really handy way of thinking about it. So just to say what you said again, for high growth companies, you're finding of these three pillars generally where product ops can help most is the business and data insights, helping them understand what's happening and make decisions more quickly, which makes a lot of sense. For more established older companies going through a digital transformation, oftentimes it's helping them with their process and making them more efficient in how they operate. Is there also a bucket for the middle pillar of customer and market insights or is that spread across?

Denise Tilles (00:15:11):
That's the squishy middle. When I do teach this class, I ask people what their perception is of product ops and people never think that. So that's an area definitely for growth I think at a lot of companies.

Lenny (00:15:26):
How does that piece work with user research and that team?

Melissa Perri (00:15:30):
So we've seen a lot of the work that is done in that team. They work with user research. Now, in organizations where let's say, this happens in a lot of organizations but not all of them, where product oversees design as well and user research and it oversees UX, this becomes seamless because you are going to have, let's say, a product ops person usually with a user research background who's going to be helping to do the stuff we talk about and the customer market insights piece, which is pulling all the research that's been done, like the customer interviews, all those things together into things like a findings database. So there's great tools out there like Dovetail, but you can also roll your own, and it's about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research.

(00:16:22):
It's also about finding participants who want to opt into research. So making sure that you have customers aware that, "Hey, we might contact you to do customer interviews. This is why. Do you want to participate in alphas and betas? If so, this is what it entails." If we can build a database of people and customers that we have who opt into those types of things, it makes it easier for product managers to go out and contact them and say, "Hey, by the way, we got a beta. Do you want to do it?" They know what it is, they're expecting it. They know what the cadence is that people will reach out to them on to do research, and the user researchers can use that as well. 

(00:16:58):
Now, the thing about the customer and market insights piece is that that person who's streamlining those activities and building those systems, they're not usually the same person who's doing the user research. So this is not about taking user research away from product managers or from user researchers, it's about enabling them to do it more effectively, enabling the insights to be put out across the company more effectively, and also helping them get in touch with users and get that feedback. 

(00:17:30):
Another piece of this too that we talk about is getting qualitative insights from sales and support. So we always hear from sales teams, and this is the classic product management tension, "The product managers aren't listening to me" or, "I've told them five months ago that I had this problem with these customers that were going to churn." We didn't build those features. What this function does with the customer and market insights here is that it helps get a lot of that information back to the product team in an effective way. 

(00:18:00):
Then it also helps communicate back to sales, "Hey, let's be a little transparent about how we're using that feedback." So that's how we can communicate it back in strategy. Let them know where we stand with working on those ideas or solving those problems for customers, but usually, there's a wealth of qualitative information stuck somewhere in our organization systems, whether it's in Salesforce, whether it's in support tickets, in somebody's Google doc of their customer interviews that they've been doing, and what we're trying to do is get that out of these individual systems and into somewhere where a lot of people can take those qualitative insights and start to learn from them.

Lenny (00:18:36):
People always ask me, "What's changing in product management? What's the future of product management?" I'm always like, "Nothing. It's going to be basically the same. It's just never going to be fully defined. It's going to keep doing this weird role," but I feel like this is actually the answer. What's changing in product management is this product ops role is emerging, taking a lot of these things that PMs don't necessarily want to be doing or aren't amazing at and giving you more space to do the things they really want to do. So I think that's pretty amazing. I think if you think about the timeline, you said five years ago there was no real product ops. Today, half of companies essentially have a product ops role and I'm guessing in another few years it'll be much higher. So this is really interesting.

Melissa Perri (00:19:12):
I'm excited about it too. I think what we saw before was that, like you were saying, product management was this squishy role for a long time, but now we're standardizing what do product managers do. What's happening, I think, though is product managers become more prevalent, and as people realize that this is a critical role for companies, whether you're a software company or a bank or something else. We build businesses off of software in today's world and if you're not building software, you are behind. With more and more software that we're putting out there, product managers don't have time to go do all these things off the side of their desk and it's fine when you're a small startup. I was doing it too. Like I said, I had to go learn MongoDB when I was in a smaller company, and then we start to scale and I've got more and more product responsibility and I'm like, "I don't have time to go learn MongoDB now," and that's where people start to burn out and where they get frustrated, like you said.

(00:20:09):
We've got more and more systems, we've got more software tools out there that product managers are using, and it becomes a lot to track. So it's either, for companies, do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?

Lenny (00:20:39):
I think that's such a powerful way of thinking about this. I imagine PMs listening to you saying, "I don't have to learn MongoDB and SQL anymore," would think. Actually, no, I think that's good. They should learn to do SQL and run their own data, but I think the important pieces here, yes, it would be great, but as you scale, it becomes harder and harder to have time to do all that because things ... You end up with other work that you need to be doing. So in theory, it would be awesome if your PMs could run their own queries and do their own research and create the whole process, but it just becomes harder and harder. 

(00:21:12):
It reminds me of a lot of companies that are trying to delay hiring a product manager in general and instead giving the role to engineers and designers. My feedback is always like, "That's great as long as they want to be doing all these things that are not generally what they enjoy doing," like an engineer doesn't necessarily love running meetings and writing one pagers and strategy docs and taking notes. So I think it's a similar thing where, sure, it's great until you don't really want to be doing that or you don't have time for that and you have your actual job you need to be doing.

Denise Tilles (00:21:41):
That's your full-time job and your OKRs and your goals are really around the outcomes for the company, you're like, "But I wrote 20 scripts this year." So we need to help them focus on the things that they're being expected to deliver in terms of value.

Melissa Perri (00:21:56):
I also think it's funny how many people want to be a product manager until they realize what product management entails. This happens a lot and I saw it with my MBA students at Harvard too. We do a whole class, they play a product manager. I had a lot of people opt out of being a product manager at the end of it. They were like, "I did not realize it was like that. I did not realize I had to do so many things." I think a lot of what gets them as well is the type of context switching that's required as a product manager. So you already, just with the basis of what we have to do, do so many different things of user research, working with the designers, working with the developers, working with executives, working with different stakeholders. You got to context switch to be able to relate to all them. You got to empathize with all these different people. You have to do all these different tasks to do this type of work. 

(00:22:46):
Then you got to go figure out what template to put your roadmap in, which is going to be different template than the other 80 product managers on your team because somebody didn't come in and just say, "Hey, we're going to use this." That type of work to me is just distracting from it. Is it hard for a product leader to just be like, "Hey, this is a template we're using"? No, but then if that product leader has to go out and train 80 other people on that template, make sure it's consistently updated all the time, make sure it's in the right formats, make sure it's in the right software, that is where the overhead comes in, and a lot of product leaders are doing this right now and what we're trying to do is free up individual product managers, but also those product leaders.

(00:23:33):
So I work with all these CPOs, these VPs of product and they're like ... I see them just not working on strategy. I'm like, "Why are you not working on strategy?" and they're like, "I don't have time to do that. I'm in here stopping all these fires. I'm figuring out what template I should put my roadmap in." Like I said, it's not hard. They know what template it should be in, but think about if you now can delegate that to somebody else and say, "I want it in this template. Go roll it out. Go roll it out, go train everybody on it, find the right software for it, do it." It frees those people up, the leaders, to go work on strategy. That's why you're spending so much money for a product leader, anyway. That's why you spend so much money for a product manager, anyway. So to me, these things are not impossible to do. It's just do we have the right people doing them?

Lenny (00:24:23):
For PMs that are trying to figure out what remains on their plate, what are the the pieces that a PM should keep and not offload on a product ops person?

Melissa Perri (00:24:33):
They don't want to offload decision rights. You should never be outsourcing your decision making to a product ops person. That's not the point. They're the product manager for the product managers. That's how I think about it. So their decision should be around, "How do I operationalize great product management here?" but as a product manager, you shouldn't be delegating to them to make any decisions about their product, and that's not their job. If they are coming to you and saying, "You should build this," that's not their job either. That's not the right thing. 

(00:25:03):
So making the actual decision and then putting that decision into play with your teams, that's the type of work that you want to hold onto for a product manager. So while a product ops person can help you point you in the right direction, let's say, to find customers, maybe even help you get in touch with the customers, send out the email to invite them to a meeting or operationalize that, hopefully that's automated. I would love a product ops person to automate that type of stuff. You are going to be doing the user research. The product ops person you can go to and maybe say, "Hey, this is the type of problems that we're understanding," and maybe they help you find other pieces of information around the organization on those topics and bring it to you, but they're not going to be the ones reading through all this information and being like, "You should build this." 

(00:25:49):
They're also not going to be the ones who you say, "Hey, I made this decision about what to build, told the team about it, the team got together. Can you go monitor the developers and make sure they're building it on time?" No, they're not project managers, they're not the people who are going to be on top of your developers watching them build things, making sure that everything's out on time. That's not their role either. They're not going to handle hard stakeholder conversations about trade-offs for you, all of those things that you are going to want to keep ownership of because at the end of the day as a product manager, your job is to produce outcomes and you do need to make sure that you're monitoring those outcomes and moving towards them. You don't want to offload their responsibility.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So I took a couple notes of just things that the PM continues to own, whatever, in quotes, no one owns anything, strategy, vision, prioritizing, resource allocation, trade-off decisions, hard conversations around trade-offs and stakeholder input and things like that. Is there anything else in that bucket of just stuff a PM, a product manager continues to be responsible for?

Denise Tilles (00:26:55):
Well, there's a big piece that we're missing, go-to-market, and that's where product ops could really make a difference in terms of connecting those teams, but also being the first point of contact for sales, first point of contact for product, and enabling just some efficiencies if we want to call it process or method, but just trying to help break down the silos. 

(00:27:19):
A company I'm working with right now, there's big challenge with that and it's a large enterprise level company. So how do we break down all of the different silos between departments and team leads and whatnot? So it's really talking about, "Here's how we're going to do it. Here's some simple templates we will use at training sales, training product," and then getting that into play. Doing the book and doing our research, that was a consistent story point from a lot of people that we interviewed that go-to-market was a really big pain point.

Melissa Perri (00:27:50):
So I think too what Denise was saying is product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things and making the standardized templates, but as a product manager, your role in informing what the go-to-market is doesn't change. You're still putting the inputs in there. So maybe product ops will provide, for example, templates and help say, "Hey, here's the different pieces that we need to make a go-to-market plan," for example, "Here's the templates. Here's what I gathered from people," but you as a product manager still have to fill out your parts. 

(00:28:21):
You still have to go talk to the salespeople. You still have to work with the marketing people to make sure it's positioned correctly, but the product ops person can help with the program management around it of getting those people together, having consistent templates, creating the cadence for when you review those things, making sure that they all align and they're all in one place so you're not going to find them everywhere, and then making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like, as Denise said, it's not like everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team.

Lenny (00:28:57):
Awesome. That's a really handy and important addition. You mentioned project management. I imagine many people think product ops also takes on project management. What's a good way to think about project management versus product ops? There's also program management. Do you have a way of thinking about those roles?

Denise Tilles (00:29:15):
The way I like to think about it is, however, whatever they're doing in terms of the three pillars of product ops is really thinking about, as I mentioned earlier, increasing the speed and quality of decision making and all of the pillars of play into that. Program manager, I think, is really thinking about larger company initiatives and the duration of their work is ongoing versus a project manager, they're responsible for certain project that's at a time box and an end date, but it does get a little wiffy, for sure.

Lenny (00:29:43):
I want to go back to the three pillars real quick and go one level deeper to help people understand what they actually entail and what are the jobs of a product ops person. So just we could even keep this brief, but just let's say with business data and insights, what are the functions and jobs and things that a product ops person would be doing for your company?

Denise Tilles (00:30:02):
A lot of companies will have a data science team or a business intelligence team and you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you don't have to have your internal product ops type of intelligence team, but it's about connecting those and making sure you're putting that with a product lens, and especially, say, with finance too. You don't want all the product managers hitting up the CFO for that month's revenue or having questions. So it's about accessing all of these inputs and putting it through a product lens and then making sure that product managers actually know what to do with it, can action it.

Lenny (00:30:36):
So it's essentially running queries for you, generating charts and graphs and recommendations based on what the data's telling you. Basically, it's doing all the data stuff that a PM would be doing. Is there anything else there?

Melissa Perri (00:30:51):
Also helping the leaders too. So we're talking about it from a product management perspective, but I think this one especially becomes really critical for leaders and executives. A lot of times, and I sit through board meetings where we talk about ARR, we talk about retention, we talk about net retention, and we talk about all of these business metrics, and they're great for monitoring the health of our business, but where product ops comes into play in business data and insights is how do we monitor the health of our product.

(00:31:22):
So as a chief product officer, ARR is interesting to me, but it's not as interesting to me as ARR by customer segment. It's not as interesting as ARR by product line. It's not as interesting if I take that and then look at it by retention or adoption by product or feature set or adoption by customer segment by product. When we start to put those lenses on it, they now become a really powerful strategy insight. 

(00:31:49):
So what I think these people do and do really well is even at the executive level, they help you ... You as a product leader are like, "I need these types of insights. This helps me. This is how our business runs and this is how I want to set the strategy." These people make those dashboards, make those repeatable insights for you. Then ideally, they know the data so well and they know your business so well that they can surface up other opportunities for you as well to look at data that you didn't know was there or can find these interesting trends.

(00:32:18):
So they are very much like the people digging into the data, they're just doing it with more of a product lens instead of, like Denise said, an overall company metric lens. It's not just in service of the product managers. I just wanted to point that out because I think this becomes so powerful for leaders because if leaders don't understand those types of metrics, they can't actually monitor their strategies. They can't go back and say, "Oh, we decided to go upmarket into the enterprise." Look, we've got enterprise revenue, but are you actually looking at where the enterprises are adopting different product lines? Are you looking at how the enterprise uses different features, and if certain enterprises are using these types of features, are they less likely to churn? It's those types of insights that I think are really important on this lens.

Lenny (00:33:09):
As a PM hearing that somebody else will be doing this, it feels really weird. This feels like such a core job of a PM is to spend a lot of time with data, try to find opportunities, try to find things going well, not going well, but I think the message, again, is not you shouldn't be doing that as a PM and it's not bad if you are really good at it, it's you probably just don't have a lot of time to do it well. If you can find someone that's really good at this and has time, that doesn't have all the other thousands of things on their plate, you'll actually end up finding more interesting results, finding more interesting insights. You're probably missing a bunch of stuff because you don't actually have a lot of time. Is that generally the way you think about it?

Melissa Perri (00:33:45):
Yeah, and I think too, the business and data insights people, they're not going to be experts on product. They're almost always not. We had a couple analysts at Produx Labs and they were ex-McKinsey, ex-Deloitte. They didn't know anything about product. So we taught them the product piece and we were the ones who were like, "Here's the interesting data I know I'm going to need to see," and they were able to pull those things together in views where we could actually dig into it, but that was a jumping off point on the quantitative research where we're like, "Okay. Now we need to go do the qualitative." 

(00:34:18):
I think for product managers, you still need to be super comfortable with data. If you can't read these charts, if you can't see or understand trends, and a lot of times too, if you're putting this stuff in Looker or a BI tool, ideally, you can pull ad hoc reports yourself. It's just that you don't have to craft a SQL query to do it. You still need to understand the relationship between data and product and you still need to understand what good data looks like. You need to understand too things like causation and correlation. You need to understand that, "If I put out this crazy marketing launch on Thursday, that's why all of a sudden we got a million signups on Thursday and we didn't get a million signups on Wednesday." They still need to understand all those things, and I don't think that becomes any less important. I don't think understanding and interpreting trends becomes any less important as a product manager's job. I just think it's about putting data into the hands of product faster so that it's not about you having to fight your way through bureaucratic processes at your company to get that data.

(00:35:21):
So product ops can help streamline things that we know we're going to look at repeatedly. There's a bunch of stuff that we know we should look at. So put them in a dashboard like, "Why should I have to go pull that report ad hoc every single time?" Put them in a dashboard, put them in a report. Same for board slides. We had one of my friends who's the chief product officer of Forsta, Brian Bhuta, and he said, "I love product ops because when we prepare for board meetings, I know there's a certain set of information that I'm going to have to put together for this board meeting, and then when we go do it manually, it becomes obsolete by the time the board meeting's over and then I got to start again and prepare for the next three months and do the board meeting again." So it's like you don't want your data to be obsolete. You want this to be in a repeatable fashion for things that you know are repeatable, but it doesn't get you off the hook of still looking for trends and looking for insights.

Lenny (00:36:17):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

(00:37:38):
We had a guest on, Casey Winters, and he has this perspective that when you have ops, operational people, that's generally a sign that something is not efficient and it could be made more efficient with software and product. Not everything can be productized, but do you have a perspective on that, that ops is often a sign where software, hopefully someday, could do itself?

Melissa Perri (00:38:02):
You still need people to oversee those programs. So I don't think they would fully be obsolete. It wouldn't be like this whole role goes away completely, but they're the people who should be looking at, "What can we do to optimize and streamline this?" and not do it with human components. I think that's why a product management mindset lands so well to a product ops function too because you're like, "How do I use software or tools or processes or frameworks to help fill in some of these gaps and standardize it and then let it run?" That what I was meaning by the shared services model. 

(00:38:32):
If you really think in that format, it's not like, "Hey, I need a team of 10,000 product ops people." I think you're doing it wrong if you're doing that right. It should be a well-run lean team who thinks about how to leverage tools for this or building your own or whatever and your products for the product team, and that's how it should be seen. So what I mean it shouldn't be obsolete one day, if you are building, let's say, products for the product team, you still need somebody to look over that product and make sure it's relevant. At the pace of everything changing like it does today, so many things are so different than they were five years ago, you want somebody to be looking over that and making sure they're still up-to-date, it's still relevant, it still works for our company and stuff like that, but you're going to have a smaller subset of people doing that. It's not going to be like, "Oh, I need a product ops team for every product manager that's on here." That's not how it should work at all.

Lenny (00:39:27):
I think that is going to make a lot of people feel better hearing that. Do you have any rule of thumb or way of thinking about just how many product ops people you want per product manager, per team? What's a simple heuristic for just how many people you may need?

Melissa Perri (00:39:43):
I don't have a hard and fast rule on that one, but I would say if you are at a one-to-one ratio, you're doing it wrong. Absolutely. 

Denise Tilles (00:39:47):
If you're at one-to-hundred, you're doing it wrong. 

Melissa Perri (00:39:54):
Yeah, too. I also think it's like ... So when we talked about it too with this hybrid versus shared services model, if you have a hybrid model, let's say, and typically, this is a symptom that your data is not well-instrumented. Let me put it that way as well. Sometimes you need a stopgap holdover until you can well-instrument your data or something, and that could be as long as it takes for certain companies. In this case, like we said, you might have a business data and insights person aligned to every director of product who oversees multiple Scrum teams. You might have one aligned to every VP of product, depending on how much help you need to get the product data out of things.

(00:40:37):
Now, if you have a very well-instrumented dataset like we were talking about at Doodle or something like that, you're probably going to have way less people because the product managers are armed and capable of going in there and being able to pull the queries themselves, do their ad hoc research themselves because they made it accessible and you made it possible for them to go do that. 

(00:40:59):
So I do think there's a balance there between how good your company is instrumented both for everything, for all three of these pieces that we're talking about relative to the size of your product ops team. It might take some more manpower at the beginning to get it going, but, ideally, you streamline this team and it becomes pretty lean and pretty small and they're overseeing multiple programs or software systems that run themselves.

Lenny (00:41:25):
Well, it gives me a lot of hope that this isn't going to become just another massive org within a company. It is looking at companies that are incredibly efficient like Ramp and Deal that have very few employees, very few product managers, and they have product ops people. So that tells me there's a lot of leverage that you can find from just maybe, I don't know, one or two that's probably not a large team of product ops people there.

Melissa Perri (00:41:48):
We say too, get started with one person. We described these three pillars and repeatedly through the book we're like, "Hone in on what's the most important part for you that's going to help you right now," that we talk through, and then just take one person and throw that out there. Usually, you can get so much leverage from that that it frees you up to do a lot of the stuff that you need to get done. Then when you're ready and you see the next hurdle and it's not something that first person can take on, then you might add one more person.

(00:42:18):
There are different expertise, I think, between the three different pillars and the people who would oversee it, and that's something to take into account as well. So like we said, in business data and insights, that person typically is not an expert on product. Hopefully they get ramped up on it working with you, but they're typically not an expert on product. A lot of times these people are not coming from a product management background. That's going to be actually a different person than I would look at to help with the governance and product pieces. That person needs to be a product background person because they're usually helping roll out the roadmap stuff, coach people on how to do it, helping to define the different systems and processes that you need on your product operating model, and if they have no experience with product management at all, that's going to be really hard for them to do and it's probably not going to be great. 

(00:43:05):
We do see this trend of people throwing agile coaches at this, and agile coaches who have never been a product manager before in a well-run company are going to struggle there because they're going to revert back to agile processes and optimizing for things like Scrum, but they're not going to do what that role is designed for, which is to help product management processes. We don't usually need another agile coach telling us how to run a standup. We need people to come in and help us figure out who's invited to these cross-functional roadmap reviews, what inputs do we need on there, and what decisions do we need to make coming out of it, and how do we communicate it at the correct level to executives as well so we're not digging into Jira at these meetings in front of A CEO. CEOs don't care about what's in Jira. Well, they shouldn't. Let's put it that way. 

Denise Tilles (00:43:57):
Shouldn't.

Melissa Perri (00:43:59):
They want to know like, "What are the big pushes that we're doing to help us reach our strategic objectives?" So it's helping that they know a little more about the right size of communication, the different cross-functional teams, what product managers do on a daily basis and what's important to them, and that's really critical in that role. So that's where, I think, your teams might just be slightly bigger from a perspective of more than one person. I'm not saying hundreds of people, but you might need a couple different people in this organization because the roles are slightly different. For the market research and the customer research thing too, you might need somebody with a user research background for that. Somebody who did research ops is a great person for that.

Denise Tilles (00:44:41):
It's pretty unusual, I think, to see companies start out with an entire team. I worked with Sam's Club and they were planning to do it that way, but mostly we see it starting organically. I think the way [inaudible 00:44:53] mentioned in her story of being a PM and feeling the pain and having the empathy of wanting to make it better, and that's typically the generation of these roles, that it might be someone being allocated part-time from their PM role and finding out that they really do enjoy this enablement aspect of it and that's where it grows.

Lenny (00:45:12):
Awesome. So let's just lean into this topic of just how to start rolling it out at your company, and you've already talked about a bunch of tips there. By the way, if you buy your book at the end there, there's this really beautiful little guy, there you go, I think, on the camera of just a little yellow brick road of all the steps that it takes to roll it out. 

Denise Tilles (00:45:12):
Yes, Candyland.

Lenny (00:45:32):
Candyland. So on this topic of just who to start with, sounds like you recommend start with one person, and what I'm hearing is pick one of these three pillars that you think is most highest leverage potentially to take off your product management plate. Is that right?

Denise Tilles (00:45:46):
Yup.

Lenny (00:45:49):
So what else should people be thinking about in starting to roll this role out, starting to build this team?

Denise Tilles (00:45:56):
That's a great question. So one of our case studies is Shintaro Matsui at Amplitude, and he created the role at Amplitude. When you think about, it's Meta. So they're creating a tool that helps in terms of product operations, but they're enabling it there as well. So he's done a really great job of getting that set up and really being a thought leader there. So the case study that we chatted with him about was introducing it and how do you get it going and how do you build the momentum and show the quick wins. That was his top tip was making sure that you set, understand, first of all, you may have a perception of what the biggest needs are, but doing your listening tour and doing your user research, some research sprints, understanding there may be a huge opportunity, but it also sounds massive in your team of one, where can you make the most difference quickly? Where can you have the most impact? 

(00:46:46):
So identifying those, celebrating those wins, making sure everybody understands that, and then showing what's above the line with a person of one the capabilities you'll have, and then below the line, things that you may not get but you could if we did think about building the team and setting the expectations as well.

Lenny (00:47:04):
Do you suggest they try to hire someone that has already been a product ops person? Is it okay to hire someone that hasn't then they just become a product ops person? How important is that experience?

Denise Tilles (00:47:14):
I think if you find someone that's done the role of product management, awesome. If someone's set it up somewhere ... Look at Blake Samic, started from Uber to Strike to AI. Clearly, he's got a model going that's really successful. So if somebody could get a Blake Samic, I would say definitely do that.

Lenny (00:47:32):
It'd be hard to pull him away from OpenAI. 

Melissa Perri (00:47:37):
I don't think he's leaving there right now. Just started, got a lot of work ahead of him.

Lenny (00:47:42):
We have a lot of LinkedIn requests right now. Here they come.

Melissa Perri (00:47:46):
Poor Blake. Sorry, sorry for your inbox. I think too it's about if you're going all in. If you're just trying to get buy-in for this and let's say it's originating from a CPO or a product leader who's like, "Hey, let's start this out," but the company's not ready to invest all the way, you might pull somebody from a different function, let's say, have them be the product ops person and try to rapidly demonstrate value. If you're a CPO or a leader and you're like, "I got budget. I know this is important. I'm totally bought in. Let's go," you're probably better off hiring, let's say, somebody who's done this before, somebody who's experienced, but also somebody who could be more of a VP or director of product ops and then they can go do the hiring and figuring out, "Do we pull people from other functions and streamline it?" That helps free up the leader as well from not having to go find 8,000. It's never going to be 8,000 people, but eight people to do that function.

(00:48:43):
So that would be a way to look at it as well. So if people are not quite sold on it, you might want to start with one function. Figure out where the burning issue is. Demonstrate that value. Show that it's something that you want to actually invest in, and then you might want to hire in a leader or help build up the team from there.

Lenny (00:49:00):
It feels like that first hire is so important because if they don't do great, the whole role of product ops starts to get a bad tinge within the company. So there's a lot of pressure on making sure that first person succeeds. I guess more reason to buy your book and make sure that they do it right. 

Melissa Perri (00:49:17):
If you feel like you as a leader can coach the product ops person and you have time to coach the product ops person, let's say, through being a good product ops person and getting started with it and directing them, you're probably good at taking somebody who does not have experience but has the right skillset and then you can teach them. If you have absolutely no time to coach this person and they're not super self-directed, let's say, so they're not going out taking classes, reading the books, doing that type of thing, probably going to want to hire somebody who's done it before, at least that portion of it, and then that person can help coach other people grow the function. 

(00:49:55):
It's the same thing with product management. We look at these teams especially in a lot of transformation companies. We have a lot of product managers who've never been product managers before, and a lot of leaders who've never been product managers before, and they ask me, "Do I hire in experienced leaders or what?" and I'm like, "Well, if those product leaders need to go coach other product managers, then you need somebody who's experienced in there. You need somebody who knows how to get that work done. If they don't have time to learn, if you're not on a timeline to actually teach these people these things and get them up to speed, then you need somebody to hit the ground running." 

(00:50:29):
So I'd look at it for how much time do we have to demonstrate value, how much coaching is available to get this person into the right mindset and the right skillset to do this and execute. I think that that's needed in almost every role, not just this one.

Denise Tilles (00:50:43):
One thing I wanted to mention was whether to hire products or product manager person for the role with the background of product ops or product management, there's not a ton of folks out there that have a products title, but as you're looking, dig in because this person may have been doing a lot of the work as a product manager or within that title. So there's a lot of people out there that probably would fit that profile, but not with a proper product ops title.

Lenny (00:51:10):
What are the key skills that you find are really important for finding this person, especially if they don't have this role? My guess is dependent on the pillar, if they're data-focused, research-focused or process-focused. What do you suggest to make sure you're looking for when you're hiring this person?

Melissa Perri (00:51:25):
With the business data and insights, you're looking for somebody who's really good at interpreting data, telling stories with data, somebody who's good at communicating to many different types of stakeholders about the data and putting it into useful ways. What I wouldn't hire for that role as a first person is it's not a database engineer. That's not what we're doing. We're not SQL-ing, turning things into the right SQL tables. We're instead trying to get the information out of the SQL tables and make sense out of it. 

(00:51:59):
So we actually find people with consultant backgrounds who are really good at this because they're usually churning out these types of reports and stuff for PE firms, VC firms, and whoever were their clients to begin with. What would be ideal is if that person has a lot of experience with a BI tool like Looker or Tableau as well and they could use it. That's not always the case. Sometimes those people are really good at Excel and PowerPoint, but they're not great at the Looker and BI. If you could find that two things together though, home run right there. 

(00:52:31):
So this person's probably a data analyst background. We did have a business intelligence background like you were talking about as well, something like that for the business and data and insights role. It does not have to be a product manager. I think you can help them, steer them in the right directions for what questions you need to answer. They shouldn't be the ones coming up with all the questions you need to answer. It'd be great if they surface some insights, but you ask them the questions, they can go get the answers.

Lenny (00:53:01):
What about for the other two pillars?

Denise Tilles (00:53:02):
Well, in terms of the process and practices, I think this person really needs a super high EQ, understanding what the needs are, but also has a good spidey sense of how much methods do we need to think about bringing to the team and thinking about how those things get introduced that it's not a mandate, but it's a suggestion of how we can work. Typically, product managers will be pretty open to that because if they're like, "I don't know what the roadmap template is. I don't know what the roadmap cadence is." "Here's some guidance." "Awesome. Now I don't have to think about how to do it, I'm just going to do it." 

(00:53:38):
So I think someone who has a lot of experience understanding the underlying tensions and opportunities, and then feels good and understands how to implement the systems thinking and also understands it's not a set it and forget it, that they're constantly reevaluating the processes, the tools, "Are these working for us?" Then understands, I think, in more broadly, "As my CPO is getting ready for a board meeting, what are the inputs they're going to need? As we're getting ready for the QBR, are the PMs ready? Do we have a cohesive stories? Anybody taking the time to look at all of the different presentations to make sure that we're giving the same perspective or building towards a certain strategy that everybody's focused on?" So that would be my advice.

Melissa Perri (00:54:30):
I think for customer and market research part, you're looking for somebody with more of a user research background here, but process-oriented. So I'd look for somebody who knows user research code, knows really good tactics for that because it can help create the toolkits, get the right type of prototyping and usability software in there. They know what good interviewing looks like, that type of stuff, but they also got this need to make things better. So they're like, "I need to create a system to do this." They're good at operationalizing stuff. I think that's a skill for everybody. They're like, "I can build a system to fix this." That's actually a really good interview guild that I would ask a product ops person and I never came up with it. I never thought about that before, but it's like, "Tell me about some process or something that you had to do in your job that you really hated and that you ended up just trying to automate a way or build a system around it to make it better." That would be a great interview question for anybody in those roles, I think. 

(00:55:27):
With the user and market insights person too, there's not a ton of people out there doing this, but there is a little research ops movement out there that I think could be really valuable here. So Jen Cardello, who is our case study on Fidelity, she runs their user insights team there and she's our VP of, I think it's user insights and she does oversee all the user researchers as well, but she also oversees a research ops team, and the research ops team is responsible for building their participant database. They also help build toolkits for people to do user research. They oversee any of the user research tools. They also go out and train other people in doing good user research. 

(00:56:07):
So with them, that looks like not everybody's allowed to go talk to customers and financial firms like this because of compliance reasons. They make sure they certify people to be able to go do good research up to certain points and they get levels for how far they can go so that they can democratize the research and help put it into their hands. Then if there's compliant issues around different research studies, they come back to Jen's team and the user researchers will help them complete it. 

(00:56:33):
So it's about how we ... There's a lot of legal things about what you can say and what you can't say to customers and stuff like that, what you can ask them, and they're navigating those complexities around there. So Jen comes from a research ops background. She comes from a whole UX background, but research ops is her thing and she's fantastic at setting up that stuff. She and I worked together at Athenahealth and she did that there. So I watched her put that into place and it was amazing and now she does it at Fidelity. 

(00:57:00):
So if you find somebody with that background, golden, but if you find somebody who ... If you can't find somebody like Jen because there's only one Jen, you should look for somebody who has at least a user research background, probably some UX background. They're really good at doing that and they want to operationalize it.

Lenny (00:57:18):
Jen's about to get a bunch of LinkedIn requests too.

Melissa Perri (00:57:22):
Sorry for your inbox, Jen.

Lenny (00:57:23):
I feel like the research team is going to hate people now for pulling you into product ops. Who would you suggest product ops report to generally at least to start?

Melissa Perri (00:57:35):
Head a product. 

Denise Tilles (00:57:35):
CPO. 

Lenny (00:57:38):
Such a clear, quick answer. I love it. How do they find time to train and work with this person? Are they the right-hand person that helps them just make everything more efficient? What's a way? What's that relationship like?

Melissa Perri (00:57:50):
I think definitely their right-hand person, and we say to a lot of CPOs, especially high growth companies, "Make your first hire just a product ops person to help you get this data out and start looking at it," because that helps them with board meetings, it helps them set strategy. Usually when you walk into a growth stage company, that's the first thing that you need to do is make sure that it's working, that you need to set it. Typically, when you're getting hired, there's usually a strategy problem and that person, they're like your right-hand man trying to operationalize that. So I definitely think that you're going to be guiding them there. 

(00:58:23):
I think this comes back to our question though about, do you hire somebody with experience or do you hire somebody who's new to it? If you as a CPO don't have a lot of time to train up somebody on product ops because you've got 8,000 fires to fight, then hire somebody with experience who knows how to do it and operationalize it. If you are like, "My biggest issue is business data and insights," for example, "and I just need to get my data so that I can do the strategy pieces and then I need to think through and work through what I want product ops to look like," maybe then you just hire the data analyst. If they're confident in the data analysis piece, it's pretty easy, I haven't done this myself, to teach them about what types of information you need to see as a product person. They're going to need a lot more handholding at the beginning because they're not going to know all the different cuts of data, but it's not an investment of an inordinate amount of time to be able to get something valuable back. 

(00:59:20):
It's not like training for 40 hours a week and then waiting six months to see results. It's more about, "I need you to go pull these types of cuts. Here's why. Let me explain to you this so that you learn it and then you can think about it next time," but that's going to help you there too. So I think it really depends. So how fast you need product ops fully rolled out and then how much time you have to train people, and then where you're starting from there and how big and how much buy-in you have to grow this thing from the get-go.

Lenny (00:59:49):
Awesome. Maybe as a last question, I'd love to go through a quick case study of a company you worked with and just share maybe how you rolled it out, what you ran into, challenges you had to overcome, and maybe the benefits and impact that adding this role had.

Melissa Perri (01:00:06):
When I was at Athenahealth, we were doing a ... Athenahealth has always been a software company, so let me put it that way, but they didn't have a formal product management role and they had just implemented it when I came in. So the chief product officer brought me in. He did not have an extensive product background, so he said, "I need to train all these product people and figure out what to do with this organization." So I came in to help him do that. We had over 360 product managers. We had 5,000 software developers there and it was a massive platform, $8 billion in market cap, I think, electronic health record system. 

(01:00:42):
So this is where I started to realize we needed product ops. This was me discovering this. So I'll tell you how we rolled it out and probably what we would do differently next time, but we had trained all the product managers. People were starting to use a lot of the things that we were teaching, and we saw that the maturity was getting a lot better in the organization, which was fantastic, but then we started to run into these problems, and these problems that we found could not be solved by just training product managers, and that's where the concept for product ops came up. 

(01:01:11):
We also realized we had way too many product managers, just way too many product managers. There was one person reporting into one person all the way down, and we were like, "This is not helpful." So we ended up training everybody, teaching people about what the role was, and then thinking through as we encounter these other problems, "What else do we need besides product managers?" Product ops became one of the things. We also had people actually move out of product management into other roles. We had people become data analysts, we had people become user researchers, we had people go into other parts of the organization, but a lot of people after we trained them actually just self-selected out of product management and some of them did come to us and say, "What else is there?" 

(01:01:53):
When we looked at the product ops role, we said, "Okay. What are the big fires that we have to fight that's just not from a lack of skills perspective?" That's a big part about product ops. It's not a replacement for product managers or product leaders not having product management skills. It's to help skilled product managers and product leaders do their job better. So this will never replace the fact that people don't have the skills to do their job. 

(01:02:19):
So where we ran into issues was, one, getting insights back to the executives on what the teams were actually doing. So the CEO and I were sitting there trying to set strategy and set the vision for the company and I was helping him formulate it into written form and help him deploy it and think through where we want it to go. He was in Jira, digging around in Jira trying to find information on what people were working on, and I was like, "You're not going to find that in Jira, especially when we've got hundreds of thousands of tickets for 5,000 people. You're not going to find this in there." 

(01:02:57):
That started to show me, "Hey, he's looking for this. What do you want to see?" He's looking for a portfolio roadmap of what everybody's doing and he wanted to see what are the big pushes we're making from a feature perspective and how do they tie back to our overall strategy and our goals. What's going to help our retention? What's going to help us get new customers? What's going to help us move into the enterprise, which was a big thing we were doing going upmarket into hospitals? We had no transparency into the allocation of R&D on that and also the roadmaps on that. 

(01:03:29):
So one of the things that we were trying to do in product ops was build that view, try to figure out how we get people to put the right information into Jira at the right level. So we actually had to train people on how to write ... At the time, we only had Jira, so epics in Jira that were not just build a button, they were more substantial than that. They actually had to meet behind it so we could look at it. Then we had to go out and find the right software to roll that up into a portfolio view so the executives could get the insights they were looking for.

(01:04:00):
We also had to build a way to track the OKRs that were deployed and actually see where it was. So we had to build the dashboards for that. So we started there and that became really important because that was a big issue was just the executive visibility, how do we make consistent roadmaps across the organizations, how do we get visibility into what's going on. As we started to identify more and more things, we said, "We're a huge team. We should actually have somebody overseeing this." 

(01:04:27):
Data and insights was a really big issue in the company in general, and we knew we had to instrument things better, and at the time, they brought in Amplitude and they were starting to put an Amplitude everywhere in the organization, but it wasn't fully rolled out yet. So we had these people who were going around trying to help the individual product teams get the information out of Amplitude and we said, "We need this to be more of a consistent thing, a consistent program." 

(01:04:52):
So that sparked the need for having our first product operations leader. So we ended up creating a VP of product operations and somebody moved from the product management role into that. She was much more of a process type person. She wanted to really help arm the teams into being able to get good data out there, but she understood product management well enough where she knew how all this stuff worked and she wanted to create the systems internally. 

(01:05:17):
So reporting into her, we had a business data and insights team that was overseeing Amplitude rollout and they were also putting people around the director level overseeing usually five to let's say eight Scrum teams on the director level, sometimes smaller just depending on the product. We had a business data and insights person embedded at that level to help get the ad hoc reports out now because we weren't well-instrumented. We said, "We're still making the programs and the shared services at the top level, but these people need to make decisions today. So how do we get them to do that?" So she oversaw that team. She had somebody directed there. 

(01:05:55):
then we also had the people looking at the portfolio views and the governance and the rollout and the rollout of that getting put into that as well. So that helped us get going with that. On the other side, so this didn't fall under product operations at the time, but like I said, Jen Cardello was doing research ops there and leading this team around the user insights. She got the participant database out. That was fantastic. She got out a bunch of different user research tools. They made a design systems database too that helped us be able to do prototyping a lot faster and have consistent design processes, which was amazing.

(01:06:32):
The head of UX reported into the chief product officer. So it still fell under the CPO, but it reported into the head of UX on that side and that was totally fine because we just collaborated with them pretty much all the time. So that's how we started to roll it out and get going and that's where that need was and it became so much better to get the insights that we needed out there. 

(01:06:53):
Then what happened was, actually, Athenahealth at this time, it was really wild and private. So this is where I left and a lot of leaders left at the same time, but they ended up restructuring it and they actually kept the product ops team. So now, Tim Davenport oversees product ops team. He was the chief of staff for the chief product officer at the time and he's been building it, again, taking the stuff that worked and then building onto it, and they're actually one of our key studies in the book as well about what Tim's doing now and how he's orchestrated as well to help with opex and capex and accounting type issues that they were having too. 

(01:07:28):
So Athenahealth has been through many different restructurings since I've been there, but they have always kept product ops and their current chief product officer said that he will never go anywhere else that doesn't have product ops. That's how much he believes in it.

Lenny (01:07:43):
Wow. What a testament to the value of product ops, 100% retention on the role through all these transitions. One of the interesting things you said is within this VP of product ops managed a bunch of different people and teams, which is really interesting because I always imagine product ops VP would manage product ops people. Is that common where they lead, say, there's a data team you mentioned and a few other team?

Melissa Perri (01:08:06):
Yeah. In this case, we did have her managing the business data and insights people and they were data analysts. I wouldn't say they were data engineers or anything like that, but there were people who were really good at pulling SQL and analyzing data from a product perspective. We actually moved. I should say this as well. We moved a lot of people who didn't want to be product managers but were good at that out of the role and into that role. So they had some product background, they had been trained in product, they were really good at the data pieces, but they were more suited for that than they were suited for product management. Like I said, a lot of people opted out. They were like, "Get me out of this role. I don't want to do this." They wanted more of a transactional type role or diving into data, and a lot of it came down to I think people under anticipate how much they're going to have to deal with stakeholders, and once they have to, they're like, "Oh, God, I don't want to do this," and I see that over and over again when it happens with product management. 

(01:09:00):
So she oversaw them, but they did work closely with the data people on the CTO side. There was a whole data team on the CTO side who were doing more of the database administration and the instrumentation of things. They were also helping to roll out Amplitude, instrument it correctly, and building the right views and things like Amplitudes or the other product analytics or other tools that they were using. We did not have Tableau at the time. That was something that was added later, but they were in charge of utilizing the data and trying to build those insights.

Lenny (01:09:33):
Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've never done this with two people. We'll see how it goes. So you can pick the question you want to take or both answer. Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Denise Tilles (01:09:48):
I'll take that. Of course, Escaping the Build Trap. It's true. 

Melissa Perri (01:09:51):
I thought you would say that. 

Denise Tilles (01:09:54):
Another one that I recommend is called Traffic. It came out this year by Ben Smith, around the invention and growth of HuffPo and Gawker and whatnot. I was in media at Condé Nast then, so peripherally part of it. It's an exciting ride that has an ending that we all know, but it's a good story, good tale.

Melissa Perri (01:10:15):
The Art of Action I think is a fantastic book on strategy and I always recommend this to people and it's out of the realm. There's a lot of great product management books out there too, but I like this one because it's a sleeper hit, I think, in the product management community. It is a fantastic description of deploying strategy and how you can tell if strategy is well-deployed in organizations or if there's gaps that you need to fill. So I find that when people read it, they go, "Oh, my God, we have all of these problems," and I'm like, "Yup, that's a strategy deployment and strategy creation problem. That's pretty apparent." So that's my favorite book to recommend to people. I love Theresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits. Fantastic book as well, just to give a shout out in the product world too.

Lenny (01:10:57):
Next question, favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Denise Tilles (01:11:01):
Deutschland 82, 86, 89. It's on Hulu. Highly recommend it, about East Germany. 

Lenny (01:11:08):
Like Pedal.

Denise Tilles (01:11:09):
Yeah, really great.

Melissa Perri (01:11:12):
I am going to go ... I just watched the House of Usher on Netflix. I love the ... It's Halloween right now. Well, it was just Halloween. 

Denise Tilles (01:11:12):
Perfect. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:22):
So I was watching all the scary movies, but I love the Netflix genre of everything from the Haunting of Hill House. Those were great.

Lenny (01:11:31):
Amazing. I started watching that and then I gave up quickly, but I should give it another chance. My wife and I have been stuck on Love is Blind. Classic.

Denise Tilles (01:11:39):
Same. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:40):
Good one.

Denise Tilles (01:11:40):
Same. 

Melissa Perri (01:11:40):
Good one. 

Lenny (01:11:41):
What a terrible, wonderful show.

Denise Tilles (01:11:43):
It is. It's the high low.

Lenny (01:11:45):
Next question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're hiring people?

Denise Tilles (01:11:49):
When was the last time you changed your mind about something really important and why? So do they have a learning mindset? Do they have self-awareness? Can they acknowledge where they were and how they evolved? So that's usually a pretty insightful question.

Melissa Perri (01:12:06):
Mine's probably tell me about a time that you failed and what happened. That one's an interesting one too because if nobody has an example of a time that they failed, that right there is an interesting sign. Two, I feel like everybody tries to turn it into a positive story. They really try to spin it and I'm like, "I don't even want you to spin it. I just want to tell me what you learned." It's fine to say what you learned at the end of that. I think that's okay, but they're like, "Oh, but this happened and all these things were great afterwards," and I'm like, "I'm not looking for a fantastic outcome. I'm just looking for did you fail and did you learn something from it." 

Lenny (01:12:43):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Melissa Perri (01:12:47):
Well, there's one I'm going to have to plug. It's not that I recently discovered it, but I talked about all the issues that we had at Athenahealth with the portfolio management system, and after that, I discovered Dragon Boat and I'm now on their advisory board, but it helped me solve that problem. So much of rolling up everything that was in Jira sits on top of it and being able to look at it in a great view. So that was so, so good. 

(01:13:13):
Another one that I have not been involved with but that I just really love because I think they're doing great things with, again, in the product ops world, is Dovetail and they are a research repository out there and they're also putting AI on top of it to help generate insights into all the research that's been done. I have no affiliation with Dovetail, but I really love what they're doing because I've had that problem of us rolling our own research repository over and over and over again, and now we've got a tool out there to do it.

Denise Tilles (01:13:42):
I guess the one I would mention is Vistali, and some product leaders that I'm working with right now are playing around with it, and it's an interesting tool that's a single workspace that you can connect your strategy and discovery and delivery visually and guides people along those paths as well. So interested to play with it more, but it piqued my interest.

Lenny (01:14:05):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, often share with someone, come back to often to help either with work or with life?

Denise Tilles (01:14:15):
Mine's both, especially with teams that I'm working with or cross-functional stakeholders that if you try to serve everybody, you serve no one. So it's about honing in on who you're actually building your product for, who your persona is, and then with my children in terms of try to be everyone's friend, but it may not happen. So it goes both ways.

Melissa Perri (01:14:37):
What's the worst that can happen with most of the things that I've done? To me when I get scared about something or trying to do something or even interpersonal reactions where I'm like, "God, I have to have this hard conversation with this person," my brain, I try to tell myself, "What's the worst that can happen?" Usually when you sit down and start to think about it, it's not as bad as you anticipate. So for me, that's always helped me manage my anxiety around difficult situations or taking a leap and trying to get out there. I think in my younger days, I was a little crippled by overthinking and by being too anxious about things and not taking big leaps. So I've tried to stick by that and keep asking myself, "What's the worst that can happen?" and it's usually not as bad as you think it is. 

Lenny (01:15:27):
I love that. Final question, since there's two of you, we'll end in a really sweet way. What's one thing you really admire about each other?

Denise Tilles (01:15:36):
Melissa is a legend, but behind the legend, she's just a really great collaborative person. So of course, we got to know each other really well writing this book together. We worked together before that, but it was a really great way of staying connected to a former colleague, someone in the industry. Especially during COVID, it was a really great way of building towards something that was bigger than the both of us. So what I love about her is that she's really revered by so many folks, but really approachable and really truly wants to help people.

Melissa Perri (01:16:16):
Thanks, Denise. What I love about Denise is she's really this calming, patient presence and she approaches everything with so much professionalism, but also can really get to the meat of the problem, help calm down certain situations where escalated, turn them around, and she's got this patience and calm about her in everything that she does that helps you focus, helps you concentrate on the big issues and she can really steer people in the right direction. So to me, I've always admired watching her coach and lead people. She led her analysts at Produx Labs as well. When things would go slightly awry or a situation would go out of hand, Denise was always like, "Nope, we'll just fix it," and dove in and was able to make it better. I always really appreciated that.

Denise Tilles (01:17:13):
Oh, shocks. We might've had a few of the what's the worst that could happen moments, right?

Melissa Perri (01:17:16):
Always.

Lenny (01:17:17):
Amazing. You two are awesome. For folks listening, make sure to grab their book, Product Operations. You can find it on Amazon, I imagine. Share where else people can find it, but two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Denise Tilles (01:17:32):
Productoperations.com, we've got some downloadables that are available for folks and questions if you want to get in touch with us. How can they help us? I'm trying to think here.

Melissa Perri (01:17:44):
Tell us your stories about product operations. We want to hear how people are implementing it, what's working, what's not working. We're always learning about this too, and I think we said in this book, it's ticking off now, but it's by no means standardized. So we want to hear about what's happening, how has your company been successful or not successful with it, what have you seen work, what have you seen not work. So definitely reach out and let us know about it. Also, you can help us by buying the book and leaving us an Amazon review if you do read it because that does help authors and we self-publish this one too, so that always helps us on there. 

(01:18:17):
You can find both of us on LinkedIn as well. I'm Melissa Jean Perri, I think on, there, but if you look for Melissa Perri, I usually pop up and Denise Tilles. Then if you want to contact us, product operations.com, we got a form on there to reach out.

Lenny (01:18:31):
Productoperations.com. Is that the best way to find where to buy the book or are there other sites you recommend people go check it out?

Melissa Perri (01:18:37):
We do. We just got it. Self-publishing has been fun, but we just got it where it is distributing now to Barnes and Noble and other bookstores. So you can usually find it on anything, but if you go to the website, it will have the most up-to-date information on where you can find it. Then if you go to your bookstore and some people are against Amazon, so if you go to your bookstore and ask for it, they will be able to order it for you.

Lenny (01:19:00):
Amazing. Thank you two for being here.

Melissa Perri (01:19:03):
Thanks for having us.

Denise Tilles (01:19:04):
Thanks for having us.

Lenny (01:19:05):

# The rise of Cursor: The $300M ARR AI tool that engineers can’t stop using | Michael Truell

## Transcript

Michael Truell (00:00:00):
... our goal with Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a very different way to build software. So a world kind of after code, I think that more and more being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What is the most counter-intuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor?

Michael Truell (00:00:20):
We definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role?

Michael Truell (00:00:29):
Many people you hear hire too fast, I think we actually hired too slow to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
You guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year and a half, which is historic. Was there an inflection point where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:00:43):
The growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential. And exponential to begin with feels fairly slow when the numbers are really low, and it didn't really show off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:00:53):
I think it's been...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today, my guest is Michael Truell. Michael is co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of Cursor, it is the leading AI code editor, and is at the very forefront of changing how engineers and product teams build software. It's also one of the fastest growing products of all time, hitting 100 million ARR just 20 months after launching, and then 300 million ARR just two years since launch.

(00:01:22):
Michael's been working on AI for 10 years. He studied computer science and math at MIT, did AI research at MIT and Google, and is a student of tech and business history. As you'll soon see, Michael thinks deeply about where things are heading, and what the future of building software looks like. We chat about the origin story of Cursor, his prediction of what happens after code, his biggest counter-intuitive lessons from building Cursor, where he sees things going for software engineers, and so much more.

(00:01:49):
Michael does not do many podcasts. The only other podcast he's ever done is Lex Fridman, so it was a true honor to have Michael on.

(00:04:26):
Michael, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Michael Truell (00:04:30):
Thank you. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:33):
When we were chatting earlier, you had this really interesting phrase, this idea of what comes after code. Talk about that, just the vision you have of where you think things are going in terms of moving from code to maybe something else.

Michael Truell (00:04:45):
Our goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look. With the technology that we have today, and as it matures, we think you can get to a place where you can invent a new method of building software that's [inaudible 00:05:16] higher level, and more productive, in some cases, more accessible too.

(00:05:21):
And that process will be a gradual moving away from what building software looks like today. I want to contrast it with maybe the vision of what software looks like in the future that I think... A couple of visions that are in a popular consciousness that we at least have some disagreement with. One is, there's a group of people who think that software building in the future is going to look very much like it does today, which mostly means text editing, formal programming languages, like TypeScript, and Go, and C, and Rust. And then there's another group that kind of thinks you're just going to type into a bot, and you're going to ask it to build you something, and then you're going to ask it to change something about what you're building, and it's kind of like this chatbot, Slackbot style where you're talking to your engineering department.

(00:06:10):
And we think that there are problems with both of those visions. I think that on the chatbot style end of things... And we think it's going to look weirder than both. The problem with the chatbot style end of things is that lacks a lot of precision. If you want humans to have complete control over what the software looks like, and how it works, you need to let them gesture at what they want to be changed in a form factor that's more precise than just, "Change this about my app." In a text box, removed from the whole thing. And then the version of the world where nothing changes we think is wrong, because we think the technology is going to get much, much, much better.

(00:06:54):
And so a world after code, I think that it looks like a world where you have a representation of the logic of your software that does look more like English, you have written down... You can imagine in [inaudible 00:07:08] form, you can imagine in kind of an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode. You have written down the logic of the software, and you can edit that at a high level, and you can point at that. And it won't be the impenetrable millions of lines of code, it'll instead be something that's much Terser, and easier to understand, easier to navigate. But that world where the kind of crazy, hard to understand symbols start to evolve towards something that's a little bit more human-readable, and human-editable, is one that we're working towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
This is a profound point. I want to make sure people don't miss what you're saying here, which is that what you're envisioning in the next year essentially is kind of when things start to shift, is, people move away from even seeing code, having to think in code in JavaScript and Python, and there's this abstraction that will appear, essentially pseudocode, describing what the code should be doing more in English sentences.

Michael Truell (00:07:59):
Yep. We think it ends up looking like that, and we're very opinionated that that path goes through existing professional engineers, and it looks like this evolution away from code. And it definitely looks like the human still being in the driver's seat, and the human having both a ton of control over all aspects of the software and not giving that up. And then also the human having the ability to make changes very quickly, having a fast duration loop and not just having something in the background that's super slow and takes weeks, go do all your work for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
This begs the question for people that are currently engineers, or thinking about becoming engineers, or designers, or product manager, what skills do you think will be more and more valuable in this world of what comes after code?

Michael Truell (00:08:50):
I think taste will be increasingly more valuable. And I think often when people think about tastes in the realm of software, they think about visuals, or taste over smooth animations, and coloring things, UI, UX, et cetera on the visual design of things. And the visual side of things is an important part of defining a piece of software, but then, as mentioned before, I think that the other half of defining a piece of software is the logic of it, and how the thing works.

(00:09:22):
And we have amazing tools for specing out the visuals of things, and then when you get into the logic of how a piece of software works, really, the best representation we have of that is code right now. You can kind of gesture at it with Figma, and you can gesture at it with writing down notes, but it's when you have an actual working prototype. And so I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood.

(00:09:59):
I think taste will be increasingly important. I think one aspect of software engineering, and we're very far from this right now, and there are lots of funny memes going around the internet about some of the trials and tribulations people can run into if they trust AI for too many things that comes to engineering, around building apps that have glaring deficiencies, and problems, and functionality issues. But I think we will get to a place where you'll be able to be less careful as a software engineer, which, right now, is an incredibly, incredibly important skill. We'll move a little bit from carefulness, and a little bit more towards taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
This makes me think of vibe coding, is that kind of what you're describing when you talk about not having to think about the details as much, and just kind of going with the flow?

Michael Truell (00:10:49):
I think it's related. I think that vibe coding right now describes exactly this state of creation that is pretty controversial, where you're generating a lot of coding, you aren't really understanding the details. That is a state of creation that then has lots of problems, you don't really... By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
One more question along these lines. You threw out this word taste. When you say taste, what are you thinking?

Michael Truell (00:12:01):
I'm thinking having the right idea for what should be built. It will become more and more about effortless translation of, here's exactly what you want built, here's how you want everything to work, here's how you want it to look. And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
Awesome. Okay. I'm going to come back to these topics, but I want to actually zoom us back out to the beginnings of Cursor. I have never heard the origin story, I don't think many people know how this whole thing started. Basically you guys are building one of the fastest growing products in the history of the world, it's changing the way people build products, it's changing careers, professions, it's changing so much. How did it all begin? Any memorable moments along the journey of the early days?

Michael Truell (00:13:05):
Cursor kind of started as a solution search of a problem, and a little bit where it very much came from reflecting on how AI was going to get better over the course of the next 10 years. There were kind of two defining moments, one was being really excited by using the first beta version of Code Pilot, actually. This was the first time we had used an AI product that was really, really, really useful, and was actually just useful at all, and wasn't just a vaporware kind of demo thing.

(00:13:43):
And in addition to being the first AI product that we'd use that was useful, Code Pilot was also one of the most useful, if not the most useful dev tool we'd ever adopted, and that got us really excited. Another moment that got us really excited was the series of scaling on papers coming out of OpenAI and other places that showed that even if we had no new ideas, AI was going to get better and better just by pulling on simple levers, like scaling up the models, and also scaling up the data that was going into the models.

(00:14:12):
And so at the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this got us excited about how AI products were now possible, this technology was going to mature into the future. And it felt like when we looked around, there were lots of people talking about making models, and it felt like people weren't really picking an area of knowledge work and thinking about what it was going to look like as AI got better and better. And that set us on the path to an idea generation exercise, it was like, "How are these areas of knowledge work going to change in the future as this tech gets more mature? What is the end state of the work going to look like? How are the tools that we use to do that work going to change? How are the models going to need to get better to support changes in the work? And once scaling and pre-training ran out, how are you going to keep pushing for technological capabilities?"

(00:15:07):
And the misstep at the beginning of Cursor is we actually worked on... We sort of did this whole grand exercise, and we decided to work on an area of knowledge work that we thought would be relatively uncompetitive, and sleepy, and boring, and no one would be looking at it, because we thought, "Oh, coding's great, coding's totally going to change with this AI, but people are already doing that." So there was a period of four months to begin with, where we were actually working on a very different idea, which was helping to automate and augment mechanical engineering, and building tools for mechanical engineers.

(00:15:44):
There were problems from the get-go in that. Me and my co-founders, we weren't mechanical engineers. We had friends who were mechanical engineers, but we were very much unfamiliar with the field. So there was a little bit of a blind man and the elephant problem from the get-go. There were problems around, how would you actually take the models that exist to today and make them useful for mechanical engineering? The way we netted out is, you need to actually develop your own models from the get-go. And the way we did that was tricky, and there's not a lot of data on the internet of 3D models of different tools and parts, and the steps that I expect to build up to those 3D models, and then getting them from the sources that have them is also a tricky process too.

(00:16:30):
But eventually what happened was, we came to our senses, we realized we're not super excited about mechanical engineering, it's not the thing we want to dedicate our lives to. And we looked around, and in the area of programming, it felt like despite a decent amount of time ensuing, not much has changed, and it felt like the people that were working on the space maybe had a disconnect with us, and it felt like they weren't being sufficiently ambitious about where everything was going to go in the future, and how all of software creation was going to blow through these models. And that's what set us off on the path to building Cursor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
Okay. So interesting. Okay, so first of all, I love that... This is advice that you often hear of go after a boring industry because no one's going to be there, and there's opportunity. And sometimes it works, but I love that in this journey, it's like, "No, actually, go after the hottest, most popular space, AI coding, app building." And it worked out. And the way you phrased it just now is, you didn't see enough ambition potentially, that you thought there was more to be done. So it feels like that's an interesting lesson. Even if something looks like, "Okay, it's too late, there's GitHub, Code Pilot's out there." Some other products. If you notice that they're just not as ambitious as they could be, or as you are, or you see almost a flaw in their approach, that there's still a big opportunity. Does that resonate?

Michael Truell (00:17:46):
That totally resonates. A part of it is, you need there to be leapfrogs that can happen, you need there to be things that you can do. And I think the exciting thing about AI is, in a bunch of places, and I think this is very much still true of our space, and can talk about how we think about that and how we deal with that, but I think that just the ceiling is really high. And yes, if you look around, probably even if you take the best tool, any of these fields, there should be a lot more that needs to be done over the next few years. Having that space, having that high ceiling, I think is unique amongst areas of software, at least the degree to which it is high with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Let's come back to the IDE questions. So there's a few routes you could have taken, and other companies are doing different routes. So there's building an IDE for engineers to work within and adding AI magic to it, there's another route of just a full AI agentic dev product, and then there's just a model that is very good at coding, and focusing on building the best possible coding model. What made you decide and see that the IDE path was the best route?

Michael Truell (00:18:54):
The folks who were from the get-go working on just a model were working on end-to-end automation programming. I think they were trying to build something very different from us, which is, we care about giving humans control over all of the decisions in the end tool that they're building. And I think those folks were very much thinking of a future where end-to-end, the whole thing is done by AI, and maybe the AI is making all the decisions too. And so, one, there was a personal interest component. Two, I think that always, we've tried to be intense realists about where the technology is today, very, very, very excited about how AI is going to mature over the course of many decades. But I think that sometimes people... There's an instinct to see AI do magical things in one area, and then kind of anthropomorphize these models, and think it's better than a smart person here, and so it must be better than a smart person there.

(00:19:55):
But these things have massive issues, and we... From the very start, our product development process was really about dogfooding, and using the tool intensely every day. And we never wanted to ship anything that wasn't useful to us, and we had the benefit of doing that because we were the end users part of our product. And I think that that instills a realism in you around where the tech is right now, and so that definitely made us think that we need the humans to be in the driver's seat, the AI cannot do everything. We're also interested in giving humans that control too for personal reasons, and so that gets you away from just your model company that also gets you away from just this end-end stuff without the human having control.

(00:20:39):
And then the way you get to an IDE versus maybe a plug-in to an existing coding environment is the belief that programming is going to flow through these models, and the active programming is going to change a lot over the course of the next few years. And that the extensibility that existing coding environments have is so, so, so limited, so if you think that the UIs may change a lot, if you think that the form factor programming is going to change a lot, necessarily need to have control over the entire application.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
I know that you guys today have an IDE, and that's probably the bias you have of this is maybe where the future is heading, but I'm just curious, do you think a big part of the future is also going to be AI engineers that are just sitting in Slack and just doing things for you? Is that something that fits into Cursor one day?

Michael Truell (00:21:20):
I think you'll want the ability to move between all of these things fairly effortlessly, and sometimes I think you will want to have the thing kind of go spin off on its own for a while, and then I think you'll want the ability to pull in the AI's work, and then work with it very, very, very quickly, and then maybe have it go spin off again. And so these kind of background versus foreground form factors, I think you want that all to work well in one place. And I think the background stuff, there's a segment of programming that it's especially useful for, which is type of programming tasks where it's very easy to specify exactly what you want without much description, and exactly what correctness looks like without much description.

(00:22:05):
Bug fixes are a great example of that, but it's definitely not all of programming. So I think that what the IDE is will totally change over time, and our approach to having our own editor was premised on, it's going to have to evolve over time. And I think that that will both include, you can spin off things from different surface areas like Slack, or your issue tracker, or whatever it is, and I think that will also include the pane of glass that you're staring at is going to change a lot. We just mostly think of an IDE as the place where you are building software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I think something people don't talk enough about with talking about agents and all these AI engineers that are going to be doing all this stuff for you, is basically we're all becoming engineering managers, with a lot of reports that are just not that smart, and you have to do a lot of reviewing, and approving, and specifying. I guess thoughts on that, and is there anything you could do to make that easier? Because that sounds really hard. Anyone that has had a large team, being like, "Oh my god, all these junior people just checking in with me doing not high quality work over and over." It's just like, "What a life. It's going to suck."

Michael Truell (00:23:11):
Yeah. Maybe you [inaudible 00:23:12] one-on-ones with [inaudible 00:23:15].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
So many one-on-ones.

Michael Truell (00:23:17):
Yeah. So the customers we've seen have most success with AI I think are still fairly conservative about some of the ways in which they use this stuff. And so I do think today, the most successful customers really lean on things like our next edit prediction, where your coding is normal, and making the next into actions you're going to do. And then they also really lean on scoping down the stuff that you're going to hand off to the bot, and for a fixed percent of your time spent reviewing code, from an agent, or from an AI overall, you could... There's two patterns. One is, you could spend a bunch of time specifying things up front, the AI goes and works, and then you then go and review the AI's work, and then you're done. That's the whole task.

(00:24:07):
Or you can really chop things up. So you can specify a little bit, AI writes something, review, specify a little bit, AI writes something, review. Autocompletes all in the way of that spectrum. And still we see often the most successful people using these tools are chopping things up right now, and keeping things fairly [inaudible 00:24:28].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:27):
That sounds less terrible. I'm glad there's a solution here. I want to go back to you guys building Cursor for the first time. What was the point where you realized this is ready? What was a moment of, "Okay, I think this is time to put it out there, and see what happens"?

Michael Truell (00:24:41):
So when we started building Cursor, we were fairly paranoid about spinning for a while, without releasing to the world. And so to begin with too, we actually... The first version of Cursor was hand-rolled. Now we use VS Code as a base, like many browsers use Chromium as a base, and hit foot off of that. To begin with, we didn't, and built the prototype of Cursor from scratch, and that involved a lot of work. We had to build our own... There were a lot of things that go into a modern code editor, including support for many different languages, and navigation support for moving amongst the language, error tracking support for things. There's things like an integrated command line, the ability to use remote servers, the ability to connect to remote servers to view and run code. And so we kind of just went on this blitz of building things incredibly quickly, building our own editor from scratch, and then also the AI components.

(00:25:45):
It was after maybe five weeks that we were living on the editor full-time, and had thrown away our previous editor, and we're using a new one. And then once it got to a point where we found it a bit useful, then we put it in other people's hands, and had this very short beta period. And then we launched it out to the world within a couple of months from the first line of code, I think it was probably three months. And it was definitely a, "Let's just get this out to people and build in public quickly." The thing that took us by surprise is we thought we would be building for a couple hundred people for a long time. And from the get-go, there was an immediate rush of interest, and a lot of feedback too. That was super helpful, we learned from that. That's actually why we switched to being based off of VS Code instead of just this hand-rolled thing. A lot of that was motivated by the initial user feedback, and then had been iterating in public from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:44):
I like how you understated the traction that you got. I think you guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year, year and a half or something like that, which is historic. What do you think was the key to success of something like this? You just talked about dogfooding being a big part of it. You built it in three months, that's insane. What do you think is the secret to your success?

Michael Truell (00:27:12):
The three-month version wasn't very good, and so I think it's been a sustained paranoia about, there are all of these ways in which this thing could get better. The end goal is really to invent a very new form of programming that involves automating a lot of coding, as we know today. And no matter where we are with Cursor, it feels like we're very, very far away from that end goal, there's always a lot to do. A lot of it hasn't been over rotated on that initial push, but instead is the continued evolution of the tool, and just making the tool consistently better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
Was there an inflection point after those three months where things just started to really take off?

Michael Truell (00:27:51):
To be honest, it felt fairly slow to begin with, and maybe it comes from some impatience on our part. I think there's the overall speed of the growth which continues to take us by surprise. I think one of the things that has been most surprising too is that the growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential, of just consistent month-over-month growth, accelerated at times by launches on our part and other things. But an exponential to begin with feels fairly slow and the numbers are really low, and so it didn't really feel off to the races to begin with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:32):
To me this sounds like build it and they will come actually working. You guys just built an awesome product that you loved yourselves as engineers, you put it out, people just loved it, told everyone about it.

Michael Truell (00:28:42):
It being essentially all just us, the team working on the product, and making the product good in lieu of other things one could spend one's time on. We definitely spent time on tons of other things, for instance, building the team was incredibly important, and doing things like support rotations are very important. But some of the normal things that people would maybe reach for in building the company early on, we really let those fires burn for a long time, especially when it came to things like sales and marketing.

(00:29:15):
And so just working on the product, and building a product that you like first, your team likes, and then also then adjusting it for some set of users, that can kind of sound simple, but then, as you know, it's hard to do that well. And there are a bunch of different directions one could have run in, a bunch of different product directions.

(00:29:35):
I think focus, and strategically picking the right things to build, and prioritizing effectively is tricky. I think another thing that's tricky about this domain is, it's kind of a new form of product building, where it's very interdisciplinary in that we are something in between a normal software company and then a foundation model company, in that we're developing a product for millions of people, and that side of things has to be excellent, but then also one important dimension of product quality is doing more and more on the science, and doing more and more on the model side of things in places where it makes sense. And so that element of things doing that well too has been tricky. The overall thing would note is maybe some of these things sound simple to specify, but doing them well is hard, and they're a lot of different way you can run in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Speaker 3 (00:30:38):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):
So what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, and [inaudible 00:30:46], and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files?

Speaker 3 (00:30:55):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:22):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.

Speaker 3 (00:31:30):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record, in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system, and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:51):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co., that's oneschema.co.

(00:32:05):
What is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor, building AI products?

Michael Truell (00:32:11):
I think one thing that's been counterintuitive for us, [inaudible 00:32:14] added a little bit before, but is, we definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development when we started. As mentioned, when we got into this, there were companies that were immediately from the get-go going and just focusing on training model from scratch. And we had done the calculation for what it to train before, and just knew that that was not [inaudible 00:32:36] going to be able to do. And also felt a bit like focusing one's attention in the wrong area, because there were lots of amazing models out there, and why develop all this work to replicate what other players had done. Especially on the pre-training side of things, taking a neural network that knows nothing, and then teaching it the whole internet.

(00:32:55):
And so we thought we weren't going to be doing that at all, and it seems clear to us from the start that the existing models, there were lots of things that they could be doing for us that they weren't doing, because there wasn't the right tool built for them. In fact though, we do a ton of model development, and internally, it's a big focus for us on the hiring front, and have assembled a fantastic team there.

(00:33:18):
And it's also been a big win on the product quality side of things for us. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way. So that was definitely counterintuitive, and surprising, and it's been a gradual thing, where there was an initial use case for training our own model, where it really didn't make sense to use any of the biggest foundation models. That was incredibly successful, moved to another use case that worked really well, and had been going from there. And one of the helpful things in doing this sort of model development is picking your spots carefully, not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to focus on places, and maybe where the best foundation models are excellent, but instead kind of focusing on their weaknesses, and how you can complement them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:05):
I think this is going to be surprising to a lot of people hearing that you have your own models. When people talk about Cursor and all the folks in the space, they would kind of call them GPT wrappers, they're just sitting on top of ChatGPT or Sonnet. What you're saying is that you have your own models, talk about just the stack behind the scenes.

Michael Truell (00:34:21):
Yeah, of course. So we definitely use the biggest foundation models a bunch of different ways, they're really important components of bringing the Cursor experience to people. The places where we use our own models, so sometimes it's to survey a use case that a foundation model wouldn't be able to serve at all for cost or speed reasons. And so one example of that is the autocomplete side of things. And so this can be a little bit tricky for people who don't code to understand, but code is this weird form of work, where sometimes, really, the next 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes of your work is entirely predictable from looking over your shoulder.

(00:35:02):
And I would contrast this with writing. So writing, lots of people are familiar with Gmail's autocomplete, and the different forms of autocomplete that show up when you're trying to post text messages, or emails, or things like that. They can only be so helpful, because often, it's just really not clear what you're going to be writing just by looking at what you've written before. But in code sometimes, when you edit a part of a code base, you're going to need to change things, and in other parts of code base, and it's entirely clear how you're going to need to change things.

(00:35:30):
So one core part of Cursor is this really suit to autocomplete experience, where you predict the next set of that you're going to be doing across multiple files, across multiple places within a file. And making models good at that use case, one, there's a speed component of, those models need to be really fast, they need to give you a completion within 300 milliseconds. There's also this cost component of, we're running tons, and tons, and tons of molecules, every keystroke, we need to be changing our prediction for what you're going to do next. And then it's also this really specialty use case of, you need models that are really good, not at completing the next token, just a generic tech sequence, but are really good at autocompleting a series of diffs, looking at what's changed within a code base, and then creating the next set of things that are going to change, both deleted and added and all of that, and we found a ton of success in training models specifically for that task.

(00:36:23):
So that's a place where no foundation models are involved, it's kind of our own thing. We don't have a lot of labeling or branding about this in the app, power is a very core part of Cursor. And then another set of places where a user own models are to help things like Sonnet, or Gemini, or GPT, and those sit both on the inputs of those big models, and on the output. On the input side of things, those models are searching throughout a code base, try to figure out the parts of a code base to show to one of these big models. You can kind of think about this as a mini Google search that's specifically built for finding the relevant parts of the code base to show one of these big models.

(00:37:02):
And then on the output side of things, we take the sketches of the changes that these models are suggesting, you make with that code base. And then we have models that then fill in the details of, the high level thinking is done by the smartest models, they spend a few tokens on doing that, and then these smaller specialty incredibly fast models, coupled with some inference tricks, then take those high level changes and turn them actually into full code diffs. And so it's been super helpful for pushing on quality in places where you need a specialty task, and it's been super helpful for pushing on speed, which is such an important dimension of product quality for us too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
This is so interesting. I just had Kevin Weil on the podcast, CPO of OpenAI, and he calls this the ensemble of models, that's the same way-

Michael Truell (00:37:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):
... they work, to use the best feature of each one, and to your point, the cost advantages of using cheaper models. These other models, are they based on Llama and things like that, just open source models that you guys plug into and build on?

Michael Truell (00:38:00):
Yeah. So again, we try to be very pragmatic about the place that we're going to do this work, and we don't want to reinvent the wheel. And so starting from the very best pre-trained models that exist out there, often open source ones, sometimes in collaboration with these big model providers that don't share their weights out into the world, because the thing we care about last is the ability to read line by line, the matrix of weights that then go to give you a certain output. We just care about the ability to train these things, to post-train them. And so by and large, yes, open source models, sometimes working with the closed source providers too to tune things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
This leads to a discussion that a lot of AI founders always think about and investors, which is moats, and defensibility in AI. So it feels like one is custom models, is a moat in the space. How do you just think about long-term defensibility in the space, knowing there's other folks, as you said, launching constantly trying to eat your lunch?

Michael Truell (00:39:03):
I think that there are ways to build in inertia and traditional moats, but I think by and large, we're in a space where it is incumbent on us to continue to try to build the best thing, and everyone in this industry. And I truly just think that the ceiling is so high that no matter what entrenchment you build, you can be leapfrogged. And I think that this resembles markets that are maybe a little bit different from normal software markets, normal enterprise markets of the past. I think one that comes to mind is the market for search engines at the end of 1999, or at the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s. I think another market that comes to mind that resembles this market in many ways, it's actually just the development of the peripheral computer and many computers in the '70s, '80s, '90s.

(00:40:03):
And I think that, yes, in each of those markets, the ceiling was incredibly high, it was possible to swish. You could keep getting value for the incremental hour of a smart person's time, the incremental R&D dollar for a really long time, you wouldn't run out of useful things to build. And then in search in particular, not on the computer case, adding distribution was helpful for making the product better too, in that you could tune the algorithms, you could tune the learning based off of the data and the feedback you're getting from users. And I think that all of those dynamics exist in our market too. And so I think maybe the sad truth for people like us, but then the amazing truth for the world is, I think that there are many leapfrogs that exist, there's more useful things to build. We're a long way away from where we can compete in 5, 10 years, and it's incumbent in our state to keep that going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):
So what I'm hearing, this sounds like a lot more like a consumer sort of moat, where it's just, be the best thing consistently so that people stick with you versus creating lock-in and things like that, where they're just... Like Salesforce, where it's just contracts with the entire company, and you have to use this product.

Michael Truell (00:41:10):
Yeah. I think the important thing to note is, if you're in a space where you run out of useful things to do very quickly, then that's not a great situation to be in. But if you're in a place where big investments, and having more and more great people working on the right path can keep giving you value, then you can get these economies of scale of R&D, and you can deeply work on the technology in the right direction, and get to a place where that is defensible. But yes, it is... I think there's a consumer-like tendency to it, and I really think it's just about building the best thing possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):
Do you think in the future there's one winner in this space, or do you think it's going to be a world of a number of products like this?

Michael Truell (00:41:53):
I think the market is just so very big. You asked about the IDE thing early on, and one thing that I think a trip of some people that were thinking about the space is, they looked at the IDE market of the past 10 years, and they said, "Who's making money off of the editors?" It's this super fragmented space where everyone kind of has their own thing, with their own figuration, and there's one company that actually makes money off making great editors, but that company is only so big. And then the conclusion was, it was going to look like that in the future. And I think that the thing that people missed was that there was only so much you could do building an editor in the 2010s for coders, and the company that made money off of editors was doing things like making it easy to navigate around a code base, and doing some error checking and type checking for things, and having good debugging tools.

(00:42:57):
Which were all very useful, but I think that the set of things you can build for programmers, I think the set of things you can build for knowledge workers in many different areas just goes very far and very deep. The problem in front of all of us is the automation of a lot of busy work and knowledge work, and really changing all the areas of knowledge work in front of us to be much higher level and more productive.

(00:43:19):
So that was a long-winded way to say, I think the market's really, really big that we're in. I think it's much bigger than people have realized than the other building tools for developers in the past. And I think that there will be a bunch of different solutions. I think that there will be one company, to be determined if it's going to be us, but I do think that there will be one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software, and that will be a very, very generationally big business. But I think that there will be kind of niches you can occupy in doing something for a particular segment of the market, or for a very particular part of the software development life cycle. But the general programming shifts from just writing formal programming languages to something way higher level. This is the application you purchase and use to do that. I think that there will be generally one winner there, and it will be a very big business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
Juicy. Along those lines, it's interesting that Microsoft was actually at the center of this first, with an amazing product, amazing distribution, Copilot you said was the thing that got you over the hump of, "Wow, there could be something really big here." And it doesn't feel like they're winning, it feels like they're falling behind. What do you think happened there?

Michael Truell (00:44:34):
I think that there are specific historical reasons why Copilot might not have lived up... So far have lived up to the expectations that some people have for it, and then I think that there are structural reasons. I think the structural reason is... And to be clear, Microsoft, in the Copilot case, obviously a big inspiration for our work, and in general, I think they do lots of awesome things, and we're users of many Microsoft products, but I think that this is a market that's not super friendly to incumbents, in that a market that's friendly to incumbents might be one where there's only so much to do, it kind of gets commoditized fairly quickly, and you can bundle that in with other products, and where the ROI between different products is quite small. And in that case, perhaps it doesn't make sense to buy the innovative solution, it makes sense to just kind of buy the thing that's bundled in with other stuff.

(00:45:31):
Another market that might be particularly helpful for incumbents is one where there's... From the get-go, you have your stuff in one place, and it's really, really excruciatingly hard to switch, and for better or for worse. I think in our case, you can try out different tools, and you can decide which product you think is better. And so that's not super friendly to incumbents, and that's more friendly to whoever you think is going to have the most innovative product. And then the specific historical reasons, as I understand them are the group of people that worked on the first version of Copilot have, by and large, gone on to do other things at other places. I think it's been a little hard to coordinate among all the different departments and parties that might be involved in making something like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):
I want to come back to Cursor. A question I like to ask everyone that's building a tool like this, if you could sit next to every new user that uses Cursor for the first time, just whisper a couple tips in their ear to be more successful, most successful with Cursor, what would be 1 or 2 tips?

Michael Truell (00:46:32):
I think right now, and we'd want to fix this at a product level, a lot of being successful with Cursor is kind of having a taste for what the models can do, both what complexity of a task they can handle, and how much you need to specify things to that model, but having a taste for the quality of the model, and where its gaps exist, and what it can do and what it can't. And right now, we don't do a good job in the product of educating people around that, and maybe giving people some swim lanes, giving people some guidelines.

(00:47:06):
But to develop that taste, would give two tips. So one is, as mentioned before, would bias less toward, trying in one go to tell the model, "Hey, here's exactly what I want you to do." Then seeing the output, and then either being disappointed or accepting the entire thing for an entire big task. Instead what I would do is I would chop things up into bits, and you can spend basically the same amount of time specifying things overall, but chopped up more. So you're specifying a little bit, you're getting a little bit of work, you're specifying a little bit, getting a little bit of work, and not doing as much the, "Let's write a giant thing telling the model exactly what to do." I think that will be a little bit of a recipe for disaster right now.

(00:47:48):
And so biasing toward chopping things up. At the same time, and it might make sense to do this on a side project and not on your professional work, I would encourage people to, especially developers who are used to existing workflows for building software, I would encourage people to explicitly try to fall on their face, and try to discover the limits of what these models can do by being ambitious in a safe environment, like perhaps a side project, and trying to kind of go around town, use AI to the fullest. Because a lot of the time, we run into people who haven't given the AI yet a fair shake, and are underestimating its abilities. So generally biasing towards chopping things up and making things smaller, but to discover the limits of what you can do there, explicitly just try to go for broke in a safe environment, and get a taste for... You might be surprised in some of the places where the model doesn't break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):
What I'm essentially hearing is build a gut feeling of what the model can do, and how far it can take an idea versus just kind of guiding it along. And I bet that you need to rebuild this gut every time there's a new model launch, when it's on... I don't know, 4.0 comes out, you have to do this again. Is that generally right?

Michael Truell (00:49:04):
Yes. For the past few years, it hasn't been as big as I think the first experience people have had with some of these big models. This is also a problem we would hope to solve much better just for users, and take the burden off of them. But each of these things have slightly different quirks and different personalities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
Along these lines, something that people are always debating tools like Cursor, are they more helpful to junior engineers, or are they more helpful to senior engineers? Do they make senior engineers 10X better? Do they make junior engineers more like senior engineers? Who do you think benefits most today from Cursor?

Michael Truell (00:49:43):
I think across the board. Both of these cohorts benefit in big ways. It's a little hard to say on the relative ranking. I will say, they fall into different anti-patterns. The junior engineers we see going a little too wholesale, relying on AI for everything, and we're not yet in a place where you can kind of do that end-to-end on a professional tool, working with tens, hundreds of other people within a long-lived code base. And then the senior engineers... For many folks, it's not true for all, and we actually often... One of the ways these tools are adopted is, there's developer experience teams within companies, often those are staffed by incredibly senior people, because often, those are people who are building tools to make the rest of the engineers within an organization more productive.

(00:50:33):
And we've seen some very, very boundary pushing kind of... We've seen people who are on the front lines of really trying to adopt the technology as much as possible there. But by and large, I would say on average, as a group, the senior engineers underrate what AI can do for them, and stick to their existing workflows. And so the relative ranking is a little hard, I think they fall into different anti-patterns, but they both, by and large, yet get big benefits with these tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:04):
That makes absolute sense. I love that it's two ends of the spectrum, expect too much, don't expect enough. It's like the three bears allegory.

Michael Truell (00:51:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
Yeah. Okay.

Michael Truell (00:51:18):
Yeah. Maybe the sort of senior, but not staff, right in the middle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
Interesting. Okay. Just a couple more questions. What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role? If you could go back to Michael at the beginning of Cursor, which was not that long ago, and you could give him some advice, what's something that you would tell him?

Michael Truell (00:51:38):
The tough thing with this is, it feels like so much of the hard-won knowledge is tacit, and a bit hard to communicate verbally. And the sad fact of life feels like for some areas of human endeavor, you kind of do need to fall on your face to... Either need to fall on your face to learn the correct thing, or you need to be around someone who's a great example of excellence in the thing. And one area where we have felt this is hiring. I think that we actually were... So we tried to be incredibly patient on the hiring front.

(00:52:20):
It was really important to us that, both for personal reasons and also for, I think actually for the company's strategy, having a world-class group of engineers and researchers to work on Cursor with us was going to be incredibly important. Also, getting people who fit... A certain mix of intellectual curiosity and experimentation, because there can be so many new things we need to build. And then also an intellectual honesty, and maybe micro-pessimism, bluntness, because if all the noise, and... Especially as the company's grown, and the business has grown, keeping a level head I think is incredibly important too.

(00:52:59):
But getting the right group of people into the company was the thing that maybe more than anything else, apart from building the product, we really, really fussed over. We actually waited a long time to grow the team because of that. And I think that many people you hear hired too fast, think we actually hired too slow to begin with. I think it could have been remedied, I think we could have been better at it.

(00:53:28):
And the method of recruiting that we ended up eventually falling into and working really well for us, which isn't that novel, of going after people that we think are really world-class, and recruiting them over the course of, in some cases, many years, ended up working for us in the end, but I don't think we were very good at it to begin with. And so I think that there were hard-won lessons around both who was the right profile, who actually made sense in that team, what did greatness look like, and then how to talk with someone about the opportunity, and get them excited if they really weren't looking for anything. There were lots of learnings there about how to do that well, and that took us a bit of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):
What are some of those learnings for folks that are hiring right now? What's something you missed or learned?

Michael Truell (00:54:18):
I think to start with, maybe we actually biased a little bit too much towards looking for people who fit the archetype of well-known school, very young, had done the things that were high credential in those well-known school environments. And actually, I think found... Were lucky early on to find fantastic people who are willing to do this with us who were later careered. I think we should kind of spent a bunch of time on maybe a little bit the wrong profile to begin with, and part of that was a seniority thing. Part of that was kind of an interest and experience thing too, we have hired people who are excellent, excellent, excellent and very young, but they maybe look in some cases slightly different from being straight out of central casting.

(00:55:12):
Another lesson is just, we very much evolved our interview loop, and so now, we have a hand-rolled set of interview questions, and then core our... Core to how we interview too, is actually, we have people onsite for two days, and do a project with us, a work test project. And that has worked really well, that increasingly you're finding that. I think how to learn about what people are interested in, and put our best foot forward, and letting them know about the opportunity when they're really not looking for anything, and have those conversations. There's definitely been... Gotten better at that over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:53):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Michael Truell (00:55:56):
I think this two-day work test which we thought would not scale past a few people has had surprising staying power. And the great thing about it is, it lets someone go end-to-end on it like a real project. It's not work that we use, it's canned list of projects. But it gives you two days of seeing a real work product, and it doesn't have to be incredibly time-enhancing other teams from time. You can take the time you would spend in a half day or one day onsite, and you kind of spread it out over those two days, and give someone a lot of time to do work on their projects, and so that can actually help it scale.

(00:56:38):
It helps to enforce, do you want to be around this person type test, because you are around this person for two days, a bunch of meals with them. We didn't expect that one to stick around, but that has been really, really important to our value to process, and then also important to getting people excited at, especially the very early stages of the company. Because before, people are using the product, and know about it. And when the product is comparatively not very good, really, the only thing you have going for you is a team of people that some people find special and want to be around. And the two days would give us a chance to just have this person meet us, and in some cases, hopefully get convinced that they want to throw in with us. That one was unexpected. Not exactly an interview question, but kind of like a forward interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
The ultimate interview question. So just to be very clear about what you're describing, you give them an assignment, like, "Build this feature in our actual code base, work with the team to code it and ship it." Is that roughly right?

Michael Truell (00:57:40):
Yes. So we don't use the IP, not shift end-to-end, but it's like a mock... Very often in our code base, "Here's a real mini two-day project. You're going to do it end-to-end." Largely being left alone, there's collaboration too. And then we're a pretty imprisoned company, in almost all cases, it's actually just sitting in office with us too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
And you've been saying that this has scaled to even today, so how big are you guys at this point?

Michael Truell (00:58:07):
So we are going on 60 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:10):
So small for the scale and impact. I was thinking it'd be a lot larger than that.

Michael Truell (00:58:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:16):
And I imagine the largest percent is engineers?

Michael Truell (00:58:19):
Yeah. To be clear, a big part of the work ahead of us is building a group of people that is bigger, and awesome, and can continue to make the product better, and the service we give to customers better. And so you don't plan to stay that small for longer, wouldn't hope so. But part of the reason that that number is small is, the percentage of engineering and research and design is very high within the company, and so many software companies when they have roughly 40 engineers would be over 100 people, because there's lots of operational work, and often, they're very, very sales-led from the get-go, and that's just quite labor-intensive. And here, we started from a place of being incredibly lean in product-led, and we now serve lots of our market customers, and it built that out, but there's much more to do there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):
A question I wanted to ask you, there's so much happening in AI, there's things launching every... There's newsletters, many newsletters, whose entire function is to tell you what is happening in AI every single day. Running a company that's at the center, the white-hot center of this space, how do you stay focused, and how do you help your team stay focused, and heads down, and just build and not get distracted by all these shiny things?

Michael Truell (00:59:35):
I think hiring is a big part of it, and if you get people with the right attitude. All of this should be asterisked in, I think we're doing well there, I think that we'd probably be doing better there too, and it's something that we should probably talk even more about as a company. But I think that hiring people with the right disposition, people who are less focused on external validation, more focused on building something really great, more focused on doing really high quality work, and people who are just generally level-headed, and maybe the highs aren't very high, the lows aren't very low. I think hiring can get you through a lot here, and I think that's actually a learning throughout the company, is that for any... You need process, you need hierarchy, you need lots of things, but for any kind of organizational tool that you're introducing into a company, the result you're looking to get from that tool also... You can go pretty far on hiring people with the right behaviors that you want to resolve from that for organizational thing.

(01:00:39):
And the specific example that comes to mind is, we've been able to get away with not a ton of process yet on the engineering front, and I think we need a little bit more process, but for our size, not a ton of process, by hiring people who I think are really excellent. One is hiring people that are level-headed. I think two is just talking about it a lot. I think three is hopefully leading by example. And for us personally, we've since 2021, 2022 been professionally working on this, and been working on AI, and we've just seen a sea change of the comings and goings of various technologies and ideas of... If you're to transport yourself back to end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this is GPT-3, Instruct GPT doesn't exist, there's no Dolly, there's no stable diffusion. And then we've gone through all of those image technologies existing, ChatGPT and that rise, and GPT-4, all of these new models, all these different modalities, all the video stuff, and only a very small number of these things really kind of affects the business.

(01:01:45):
So I think we've kind of just built up a little bit of an immune system, and know when an event comes around that actually is really going to matter for us. This dynamic too of there being lots, and lots, and lots of chatter, but then maybe only a few things that really matter, I think has been mirrored in AI over the last decade, where there have been so many papers on deep learning in academia, so many papers on AI in academia, then the amazing thing is there are really a lot of... A lot the progress of AI can be attributed to some very simple elegant ideas that have stayed around, and the vast majority of ideas that have been put out there haven't had staying power, and haven't mattered a ton. And so the dynamic is a little bit mirrored in the evolution of deep learning as a field overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:33):
Last question. What do you think people still most misunderstand, or maybe don't fully grasp about where things are heading with AI in building in the way the world will change?

Michael Truell (01:02:46):
People are still a little bit occupied too much, either end of a spectrum of it's all going to happen very fast, and this is all bluster, and hype, and snake well, and I think we're in the middle of a technology shift that's going to be incredibly consequential. I think it's going to be more consequential than the internet, I think it's going to be more consequential than any shift in tech that we've seen since the advent of computers. And I think it's going to take a while, and I think it's going to be a multi-decade thing, and I think many different groups will be consequential in pushing it forward.

(01:03:24):
And to get to a world where computers can increasingly do more, and more, and more for us, there's all of these independent problems that need to be knocked down, and progress needs to be made on them, and some of those are on the science side of things of getting these models to understand different types of data, be faster, cheaper, smarter, conform to the modalities that we care about, take actions in the real world. And then some of it's on how we're going to work with them, and what's the experience that a human should actually be seeing and controlling on a computer, and working with these things.

(01:03:58):
But I think it's going to take decades. I think that there's going to be lots of amazing work to do. I think that also, one of the most... A pattern of a group that I think will be especially important here, not to talk our own book, but I think is the company that works on automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work, builds both the technology under the surface for that, integrating the best parts from providers, sometimes doing it in-house, and then also builds the product experience for that. I think people who do that, and... We're trying to do it in software, people do that in other areas, I think those folks will be really, really, really consequential. Not just for the end value that users see, but then I think as they get to scale, they'll be really important for pushing forward the technology, because I think they'll be able to build... The most successful of them will be able to build very, very big businesses. So, excited to see the rise of other companies like that in other areas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:59):
I know you guys are hiring. For folks that are interested in, "Hey, I want to go work here, and build this sort of stuff." What kind of roles are you looking for right now? Anyone specifically you're trying... Any roles you're most excited about filling ASAP? What should people know if they're curious?

Michael Truell (01:05:12):
There are so many things that this group of people need to do that we are not get equipped to do. Generic across the board, first of all, and so if you don't think we have a role for something, maybe you should reach out, that won't actually be the case. And maybe we can actually learn from you, and decide that we need something that we weren't yet aware of. But by and large, I think that two of the most important things for us to do this year are have the best product in the space, and then grow it. And we're kind of in this land grab mode, where almost everyone in the world is either using no tool like ours, or they're using one that's maybe developing less quickly. So growing Cursor too is a big goal, and I would say, especially always on the hunt for folks who... Excellent engineers, designers, researchers, but then folks all across the business side too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
I can't help but ask this question now that you talk about engineers, there's this question of just, "AI's going to write all our code." But everyone's still hiring engineers like crazy. All the foundational models, so many open roles.

Michael Truell (01:06:28):
Yeah. We're not out there tooting the horn of, people can learn to code.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):
Do you think there's going to be an inflection point of engineering roles start to slow down? I know this is a big question, but just... Do you see engineers being more and more needed across all these companies, or do you think at some point there's all these Cursor agents running building for us?

Michael Truell (01:06:45):
Again, we have the view that there's this both long messy middle of it not jumping to a, just you step back, and you ask for all your stuff to be done, and you have your engineering department. And very much, you want to evolve from programming as it exists today, we want humans to be in the driver's seat, and we think even in the end state, that's giving folks control over everything is really important, and you will need professionals to do that, and decide what the software looks like.

(01:07:18):
So both I think that, yes, engineers are definitely needed. I think that engineers will be able to do much more. I think the demand for software is very lasting, which is not the most novel thing, but I think it's kind of crazy to think about how expensive and labor-intensive it is to build things that are pretty simple and easy to specify, or it would look like it to the outside observer, and just how hard those things are to do right now.

(01:07:49):
All of the stuff that exists right now that's justified by the cost and demand that we have now, if you could bring that down by [inaudible 01:07:56], I think you would have tons, and tons, and tons of more stuff that we could do in our computers, tons more tools. And I've felt this, where... One of my early jobs actually was working for a biotechnology company, and it was building internal tools for them, and the off-the-shelf tools that existed were horrible, and did not fit their use case at all. And then the internal tools I was building, there was definitely a ton of demand there for things that could be built, and that far outstripped just the things that I could build in the time that I was with them.

(01:08:29):
The physics of working on computers are so great, you should be able to basically just move everything around, do everything that you want to do. There's still so much friction, I think that there's much more demand for software than what we can build today with things costing like a blockbuster movie to make simple productivity software. And so I think long into the future, yes, there will actually be more demand for engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Is there anything that we didn't cover that you wanted to mention? Any last nugget wisdom you wanted to leave listeners with? You could also say no, because we've done a lot.

Michael Truell (01:09:00):
We think a lot about how you set up a team to be able to make new stuff, in addition to continuing to improve the stuff that you have right now. And I think if we were to be successful, IDE is going to have to change a ton, [inaudible 01:09:18] looks like is going to have to change a ton going into the future. And if you look around, the companies we respect, there are definitely examples of companies that have continued to really ride the wave of many leapfrogs, and continue to actually push the frontier. But they're kind of rare too, it's a hard thing to do. So part of that is just kind of thinking about the thing, and trying to reflect on it in our good days, and the first principle side of things, part of it's also trying to get in and study past examples of greatness here, and that's something that we think about a lot too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):
Yeah. Yeah. Before we started recording, you had all these books behind you, and I was like, "What's that over there?" It's the history of some old computer company that was influential in a lot of ways that I've never heard of. And I think that says a lot about you of, where a lot of this innovation comes from, is studying the past, and study history, and what's worked and what hasn't.

(01:10:19):
Okay. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe apply? You said that there may be roles they may not even be aware of, where do they go find that, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Michael Truell (01:10:28):
Yeah. If folks are interested in working on this stuff, would love to speak, they can find... If they go to cursor.com, they can kind of both find the product and find out how to reach us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):
Easy. Michael, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Michael Truell (01:10:44):
It was wonderful. Thank you.

# Vision, conviction, and hype: How to build 0 to 1 inside a company | Mihika Kapoor (Product, Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I asked on Twitter, "Who's the best product manager you've worked with?" You were the most mentioned.

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:04):
My take is that your scope is the world. Nothing should ever perceive as being out of bounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):
VP of product at Figma told me, "Mahika is really great at creating a vision and getting people to see what she sees."

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:16):
We lean heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light. If you and your team do your job correctly, what does the world look like?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
Say somebody wants to make their culture more entrepreneurial, what does it take?

Mihika Kapoor (00:00:31):
We have this concept called Maker Week, which is our internal hackathon, giving people the breathing space to see ahead into the horizon and be wildly ambitious.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
Today, my guest is Mahika Kapoor. Mahika is a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, where she was an early PM on FigJam, and is now spearheading development of a new product that the company's going to launch in June. She's known as the go-to person at Figma for leading new zero-to-one products. And as you'll hear in our conversation, is beloved by everybody that works with her. Prior to Figma, Mahika founded Design Nation, a national nonprofit that democratizes undergraduate student access to a design education, and led several products and launches at Meta, focused on commerce and creators.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:16):
On this podcast, I bring on a lot of amazing senior product leaders, but there's so much we can learn from stellar on-the-ground product managers like Mahika. In our conversation, we drill into many of the skills that Mahika has cultivated that have contributed to her success, including how to develop a compelling vision, get buy-in for your ideas, how to develop conviction, empathy, the importance of culture, and how to create a culture on your team and within the company, and also how to deal with the constant change that happens within successful organizations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:47):
We also spent a bunch of time on how to effectively bring new ideas in your company from zero to one to launch, including getting to a bunch of the stories behind some of Figma's most successful products and features, and how many of them began at hackathons and Maker Weeks. Mahika is a truly special product manager and leader, and I feel fortunate to have had this chance to learn from her. We went quite long on this conversation, but honestly, this could have gone for another two hours. With that, I bring you Mahika Kapoor, after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:29):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product development teams. Are your users constantly requesting new integrations with other SaaS platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native product integrations take months of engineering to build, and the maintenance never ends. Paragon enables your engineering team to ship integrations seven times faster than building in-house by removing the complexities around authentication, messy third-party APIs, and debugging integration errors. Engineering teams at companies like Copy.ai, Cinch, TLDB, and over 100 other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result? Their shipping integrations on demand, which has led to higher product usage, better retention, and more customer upsells. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you go to market faster with integrations today. That's useparagon. com/lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:33):
This episode is brought to you by Lenny's Job Board. As many of you may or may not know, for the past couple of years I've been running a recruiting service. I've introduced over 30 companies to their next hire and helped build a candidate pipeline for tons more. I've been fortunate to work with companies like Ramp, Figma, Shopify, many more, plus a bunch of exciting young startups connecting each to extremely talented engineers, designers, and product leaders that make up my community. Because of its success and the value that it's driven to companies and to people looking for jobs, we're ramping up the service in a big way. I'm beta testing a bespoke headhunting style service and I'm opening up a handful of slots. We work with a select group of companies each month. If you need to make a key product hire or quickly expand your team, I'd love to see if I can help head to Lennysjobs.com/talent and hit meet candidates to get started lennysjobs.com/talent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:29):
Mahika, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mihika Kapoor (00:04:33):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. I am a huge fan of the podcast and really excited to be chatting today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:39):
Just to set expectations, this is going to be a Mahika love-fest podcast. And what I want to try to do with our time here is have an archeology of Mahika to understand what you've learned about product and building product, in particular because you are thriving at Figma, which is one of the most interesting and successful tech companies in the world with one of the best product teams in the world. So, basically, I just want to learn as much as I can from what you've learned and what you've done in order to create more Mahikas in the world. That's kind of my goal here because I feel like that would [inaudible 00:05:11].

Mihika Kapoor (00:05:11):
Mildly frightening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):
In a very cool way, not in a creepy way. So, what I did to prep for this conversation is I, as I said, reached out to a bunch of your colleagues at Figma to ask what you're especially strong at. And what I want to do is kind of go through some of these key skills, and they're essentially the core attributes of great product managers and learn from you, learn from what you learned about how doing these things well, and just what you do to be successful at these things. How does that sound?

Mihika Kapoor (00:05:40):
That sounds good. One thing to call out is that I think when I think about my own PM style, it's definitely not a tick-all-the-boxes style. There are plenty of things that I'm very bad at that PMs are traditionally supposed to be great at, so happy to chat about what makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:59):
Okay, that's actually really cool. So, let's save that for the end, the things you think you're bad at. The way I see this is a reverse performance review. Here's all the things you're amazing at, let's just go spend all our time on that. But I think that's going to be really important. But just along those lines, what I'm hearing is there's a sense of do the things you are good at really well. This is a trend on the podcast, is lean into your strengths. Is that the way you see it? Do you have thoughts along those lines of just the fact that you've been successful, knowing you have these things you're not amazing at? Then we'll talk.

Mihika Kapoor (00:06:27):
It's important to have two things. One is of course lean into your strengths. I think that PMing is traditionally a sort of generalist role and people fall into it in a number of ways. But most often than not, I hear people fall into it by trying a bunch of other things and then realizing that, "Oh, hey, maybe this PM thing makes more sense for me." So, for me personally, it was I have always been a very left brain, right brain kind of a person. I majored in CS and minored in visual arts. And when I worked as a software engineer, I really missed the design side, and when I worked as a designer, I missed the technical. And moving into product was a really great way to kind of straddle both and have more touch points across the product development cycle. And so, I think that based on how you fell into it, you might have different spikes and different strengths and leaning into those is really important. But for the other things, it's also of course important to have a growth mindset and to constantly be conquering what comes next.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:32):
Okay, cool. Okay, so I'll save the stuff you think you're bad at for later. Let's start with the stuff you're basic at. Okay. So, the first is vision. So, Sho Kuwamoto, VP of product at Figma told me that, "Mahika is really great at creating a vision and getting people to see what she sees. She's working on a new project now and put together one of the best pitches I've ever seen internally at what it could become, why it'd be differentiated, et cetera. And like every new project, this had up and downs, but she's incredibly driven to keep the flame alive throughout these ups and downs." Can you just talk about what you've learned about doing this well, creating a compelling vision, getting people excited, getting buy-in for big ideas?

Mihika Kapoor (00:08:12):
Yeah, absolutely. So, my take is that vision is everything. It is really important to create a vision that you believe in, that your team believes in and that your company believes in. Because the reality of the product development cycle is that it's so messy, it's so chaotic. You're going to have extreme highs and extreme lows. You're going to march in a certain direction only to hear from your users that it might just be the wrong direction, and totally pivot. And in order to ensure that moments that are not discouraging, but rather, learning opportunities for your team team, it's so important to be anchored on that singular vision because then any step along the way feels like forward progress.

Mihika Kapoor (00:09:03):
So, first, just want to underscore the importance of having that vision and that perspective on if you and your team do your job correctly what does the world look like? In terms of crafting a compelling vision, I think that there's sort of a few aspects. The first is that you cannot go into a vacuum and come out with a compelling vision that does not exist. You have to be fundamentally inseparable from your users, and also, fundamentally inseparable from your team. And so, I think that there is sort of this important cross-pollination of functions that is really important in crafting a compelling vision. You want to always ensure that there are research insights that help you feel what a user is feeling. You want to ensure that there are beautiful designs and prototypes that help communicate what this future world looks like, and you also want to root it in engineering and feasibility. And you want to be constantly, even in the vision phase, assuring that what you're marching after is something that is achievable and something that you can work towards.

Mihika Kapoor (00:10:21):
And so, I think a lot of folks when they think about visioning, they kind of think about, "Okay, how do we start from scratch and learn about the user and then translate that into designs and then translate that into engineering?" And it becomes this very almost linear process. And I think that to the extent that you can have this cross-pollination of ideas and people working together, that leads to a really strong vision. And there's this book that I love called The Medici Effect, which basically talks about how when people come from different places and you have that confluence of ideas, that leads to innovation at the end of the day.

Mihika Kapoor (00:10:56):
The second piece is, okay, once you have your vision, once you have talked to your users and built up your perspective and things like that, it's like how do you communicate it internally and how do you help everyone around you see what you're seeing? And I think something that's really unique about Figma is that it is a fundamentally very, very detail-oriented culture. And it's also a company that very much practices what it preaches in terms of the future being visual communication. And so, I've found that words will only get you so far. So, when I put together a vision with my team at Figma, it's all about not just your traditional, "Okay, here are pain points. And then, here are solutions. And then, here is the timeline and costing." But rather how can you bring all of those things together and how can a vision pitch effectively be pain point, solution, proof point, pain point solution proof point?

Mihika Kapoor (00:11:58):
Because at the end of the day, simply describing a product idea in words is not as compelling as seeing a testimonial from a user on top of a prototype or a mock, and really feeling the pain points.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
Is there an example that we could talk about? I know you can't talk about the product you're working on yet, but from the past of a vision that you crafted maybe to share what the vision was or how you came to that to make this even more real?

Mihika Kapoor (00:12:24):
So, before I was working on the new product, I was working on the FigJam team, and I was an early member of the FigJam team. And whiteboarding was something that really took off during the pandemic because it was the first time that people were not together in office, couldn't jam together, couldn't just throw up a whiteboard behind them physically. And so, there was kind of this question of, okay, how do you combat these disparate teammates and pull them together into a common space? And I think that when we think about FigJam and what success might look like for FigJam, a part of it that I was really invested in was the meetings experience. And specifically, what the world would look like if we were successful at bringing people together into a common space?

Mihika Kapoor (00:13:23):
And one of the early insights was, okay, what is the most common meeting that takes place in a FigJam file? It's a brainstorm, right? It's like you have a bunch of people, you've coming together and they're dropping a bunch of stickies and stuff like that. And so, you have this proof point of an activity that works really well inside of a FigJam file. But then, at the same time, something that's really interesting about FigJam, people often ask, "Oh, you guys are Figma. How do you guys use Figma as a company?" And it's kind of interesting because I feel like we use Figma the way that everyone uses Figma, but we use FigJam on steroids. Every single activity in this company is done in FigJam. Our product reviews are in there, our Gantt charts are in there, our bug bashes are in there. Every single thing is in FigJam.

Mihika Kapoor (00:14:10):
And there was this gap between the way that we were using FigJam as a company and the way that the rest of the world was using it, but brainstorms were working. And so, you kind of think, "Okay, what's unique about a brainstorm?" And you talk to your users and you're like, "Why does a brainstorm make so much more sense in a FigJam file than anything else?" And what it comes down to is brainstorms are this incredibly democratizing process. It's this process where ideas can come from anywhere, where it's not the loudest or the most important person in the room who's doing the talking, but it's everyone altogether. And you're able to elicit reactions from people who are more quiet in a meeting or people who may prefer to ideate on their own before coming out to everyone and things like that.

Mihika Kapoor (00:14:53):
And so, we started with the seed of brainstorms being this highly democratic process. And what you see is that in most other scenarios, meetings are very one way. You have one person talking, and everyone else reacting. This is true of a team kickoff. This is true of an all-hands. This is true of basically every sort of scenario. And so, what we fundamentally started marching towards was how can we create this world where the generative nature of a brainstorm is basically the norm in other kinds of meetings. Where a team kickoff is not just a PM and a designer handing mocks to an engineer, but it's everyone leaving stickies and everyone commenting at the same time, or everyone leaving...

Mihika Kapoor (00:15:44):
We have this ritual called Kudos Boards inside of FigJam, where everyone will shower each other with love and just kind call out their teammates for what they've done over the last week or so. And so how can we ensure that those kind of rituals are in our templates and that we're teaching people how to take any meeting and make it more democratic? And then, you anchor on this vision around, okay, what does a more democratic workplace look like and how can we get people to anchor around that and how can we get people to get into the flow? So, then we started launching features like music, like voting, that really help you get into flow when you're in that pile together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:22):
That is such a cool example. I'm trying to be this archeologist studying what you're describing and breaking it apart. So, what I'm hearing essentially is there's this insight that you find of, "Oh, here's a way we should think about the way future of work. It should be more democratic," building on this idea of brainstorming, which is one of the most inspiring ways of working where it's not just someone sitting in a silo. And then, you take that and create kind of a, "Here's what the world could look like if we could make everything this feel this way, very democratic." And then there's this pitch that you eventually make of, "Here's the product." And you talked about how the way you pitch it is, "Here's a pain, here's a solution, and here's a proof point of that solution," could be a testimonial or some data, I imagine.

Mihika Kapoor (00:17:06):
Definitely. I think that when you're actually presenting a vision, one of the most important things is that there is a single artifact that the team is creating together. So, I think a common occurrence is to have the research readout, followed by the design crit, followed by the product review. And that's fine, that works in a lot of instances, but then you have every team member thinking that their own deliverable is what they need to pour all their energy into. And what you actually want is for everyone to feel incredible ownership and incredible passion about this combined deliverable, so that it's a unified team who believes a singular set of insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:52):
So, what's an example of that? Is it like a deck in Figma?

Mihika Kapoor (00:17:54):
Yeah, exactly. So, we often make our decks in Figma, and I think that we lean heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light. So, I think that's something that's really unique about Figma is normally you will talk about the market space or the opportunity of the sizing, and then decide to invest. Versus Figma is very much a see to believe and see to feel that emotional pull towards this is something worth investing in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:25):
Got it. So, that's what I was trying to get to is how do you actually deliver a vision? So, a lot of people, " Here, I need to create a vision. I'm going to write out a paragraph or a memo describing it." You can create mock-ups. The way you're describing it, essentially, is make it as real as possible, not just mocks, but actual prototypes potentially. Many people don't have design skills or designers on their team or engineering skills to build a prototype. Is there anything you can share for how to do this where you don't have those skills?

Mihika Kapoor (00:18:54):
Yeah. Well, the good thing is that with AI, it's getting way easier. So-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
True.

Mihika Kapoor (00:19:00):
A couple of weeks ago, Cognition launched, which for those who don't know, is a startup that made this AI agent called Devin, which can code anything for you, supposedly. It definitely took Twitter by storm and got me super stoked. And so, I think something that's interesting about the current AI revolution is that it's very much lowering the floor to starting out and to building something. And so, recently, I was doing a chat with David Huang from Replit, and he's the head of marketing and design at Replit. And he was basically talking about how if Replit does their job right, you start seeing it as your technical co-founder. And I think, conversely at Figma we kind of think about if we're doing our job, maybe in the future people will think about Figma as their designer co-founder, where you can go in and use it to start bringing things into existence.

Mihika Kapoor (00:20:03):
So, I think one is, yeah, I do think that we're just trending in a direction, and this was not true a year ago, where the floor to building something is just so much lower. So, that's one piece. I think the second piece is just go around and ask people. And so, for example, for the project that I'm currently working on, I used a hackathon to pitch it. And basically, I built conviction in the idea many months before the hackathon, and I was verbally pitching it. And it was kind of like, "Oh yeah, maybe at some point in the future we would make an investment like this."

Mihika Kapoor (00:20:43):
But what actually ended up happening was we have this concept called Maker Week, which is our internal hackathon, where the entire company goes on pause for a week. And I think that most people think that, "Oh, hackathons are only a time for engineers to build." And I think that that's one of the biggest mistakes ever. I think that anyone can have an idea and can... Literally, what I did was walk around the New York office asking every single person, "Will you work on this thing with me?" And eventually, someone says yes, and then you can use that to build momentum, grow the team, and build something great. But I think that never letting your own skills stop you from going out there making a pitch and then turning that into reality is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:27):
I love both of these points and pieces of advice. I feel like I always say that if a PM has a designer partner that can just help them with a deck or help them with ideas, that you're such a superpower, everything just looks so much more interesting when you have a designer helping you craft your idea. And the way you describe it is pretty simple. Just go ask people for help because you're probably going to find someone that's going to help you out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
You mentioned conviction, so that's a great segue to else where I wanted to go next. So, I asked Yuhki, chief product officer at Figma, about your strengths. And he told me that you get extremely strong conviction extremely quickly. He said that this strong conviction allows you to navigate the messy journey from zero to one and rally your team in a really powerful way. He actually wanted me to ask you this very question, how do you get to this strong conviction? And how much of it is to true deep conviction, versus there's an inkling of instinct that this is going to work and then you profit on the sense of conviction to get people rallying behind you and to kind of take this leap of faith?

Mihika Kapoor (00:22:31):
I think that one of the most important things for a PM to create for their team is momentum. You have to constantly be creating forward progress, probably towards that vision that we were just talking about. But I'm a huge proponent of Jeff Bezos's one-way doors, two-way doors framework. And I think that especially in a software company, most things are two-way doors. You can come back. And so, it's so important to have an opinion and use that opinion to anchor people around and have people react to. So, I used to work at Meta before I worked at Figma, and Meta basically distilled the product role into two core capabilities. One was product sense and one was execution. And when you think about product sense, it's like, okay, what is product sense? It's like a really abstract term. And at the end of the day, I think product sense is just having good intuition.

Mihika Kapoor (00:23:34):
And so, there's this question about, okay, how do you build up intuition? And I think that it's just by having this insatiable curiosity and talking to users at every chance you get. So, I would go to dinners and grill the people around me on how they use Figma and how they use FigJam. And I think when you have a conversation with someone, it's so much more powerful in terms of getting those anecdotes to stick in your head. And what actually happens is once you start having enough conversations, let's say you start with conversations ABC, then you progress to conversations DEF, over time you build this almost repository or library of conversations that you can draw from as you're making product decisions. And so, I think that that's a really powerful thing to lean into as you're thinking about, "Okay, which path do we go down?"

Mihika Kapoor (00:24:23):
Now, there's the question of in the absence of any external signal, what can you do? And I think that a very common thing, especially for PMs who are younger in their career, is to think that your opinion isn't right or might not be reflective of what the user thinks. So, you think, "Okay, I believe this," and at the end of the day, everyone has an opinion, right? So, "I think this, but what do I know compared to these people who've been in my company for 10 years?" Or, "What do I know compared to my users who are using the product?" And so, then I think what might happen in those instances is you kind of start from nothing, you start from zero and you're like, "Okay, I'm going to build up from zero and gather all of these insights to get to a good place."

Mihika Kapoor (00:25:11):
And I think my take is that putting out an idea, even if it's totally wrong, is a much better catalyst for getting to a good solution because people are much more likely to react to an idea than to nothing. So, if it's the right idea, then they'll be like, "Oh my God, yes, let's totally do that." And if it's wrong, then it's like, okay, then they will take you in a different direction and you end up with something that's probably much more opinionated than if you hadn't put anything out there. And so, it was funny, one piece of advice that I got from Yuhki when I was working on my vision sprint was like, "Okay, when you go into research, you want to go in with something that's at least an A- idea, or you think is at least an A- idea. Because if you talk to users and you learn something about it, that's awesome. Get to an A+. If not, at least you're not at a B." And so, I think that having-

Mihika Kapoor (00:26:03):
If not, at least you're not at a B. And so I think that having that early conviction, being willing to communicate it, being willing to get feedback from other folks in your team, have them react to it, then get users to react to it, is so important, but then also something that's equally important when you have "high conviction", quote, unquote, is to be willing to kill your darlings if you hear something that tells you otherwise. You need to be so sort of strong opinions weekly held. And if you get external signal that's telling you something different, you should be ready to pivot and have that agility to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:37):
There's a lot of PMs that kind of worry about having too strong of an opinion and being like, "Here's what we're doing," because then there's this like, "Oh, okay, they just want us to do the thing they want us to do, and we don't have a voice. We don't have a chance to influence." It seems like you find a really magical balance of strong opinion of like, "Here's what we should be doing," but people still love working with you and don't feel like... I haven't heard like, "Oh, she just tells us what to bill." What advice do you have there of just finding that balance and making it clear? It's just my idea. We can change it.

Mihika Kapoor (00:27:07):
I would say that speaking about weaknesses, having such strong conviction absolutely has downsides. In particular, it's possible that it doesn't have the desired effect. So for example, my designer who I work with, his name is Kean, he's so talented. We work like this. Literally for most of last year, we had an hour long one- on-one every single day and still that wasn't enough-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
Everyday?

Mihika Kapoor (00:27:32):
... meeting time. Yes. We basically work together like this, but he also told me that when I joined the company, he was like, "Who is this girl and why does she have so many opinions?" And so I think that something that I have learned to do over time, and I think that's something that's a good sort of thing to lean into if you are a PM who has strong opinions, is to be very direct about how much you care about your opinions. So now, I'll do this thing where I'll be like, "Oh, I think we should do this, but I feel like medium confidence on it." So if you feel stronger like, "I defer to you," and always being very, very, very explicit about like, "I feel really strongly about this," or, "This is my hypothesis," or, "I do not have an opinion here. I defer to you."

Mihika Kapoor (00:28:21):
I think the second thing that I would mention that is really important in order to do this correctly is... So I have a very direct communication style. I will never sugarcoat anything. I'll never say I like something if I don't like something. If I'm in a meeting and someone tells me they don't agree with me, I will tell them I don't agree with them back. In return, I really like it when people are very direct with me. And so I think that whenever I join a team or whenever I start working with a new person, I always let them know. I'm always like, :I am very direct and if you disagree with me, I want to know that."

Mihika Kapoor (00:28:55):
Because I think sometimes what can happen is really strongly minded PMs can go into a conversation and can be like, "Oh, I think we should do X," even though they actually feel medium confidence about X. And then the rest of the room is like, "Oh, my God. That PM feels so strongly about doing X that I'm not going to say anything because they clearly have so much conviction in X." And what you actually want is for everyone to feel comfortable speaking up. And so creating that culture where everyone feels comfortable giving their opinion and communicating their level of confidence is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
So this direct communication point you made, somebody shared this quote, Alice Ching, who I think your EM said this about you that she's in awe of how direct you are, especially how you can make it not personal and help people focus on the matter at hand. Any other advice you have there for people to, one, either be more direct and successful in that being directness? Or is there an example you can share where, because I think people hear this, they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to be direct. I'm going to be so direct, it's going to be great," and then it's so hard to actually do, so is there maybe an example that comes to mind of here's something you did recently of like, "Oh, wow. Okay, I see what she's talking about"?

Mihika Kapoor (00:30:07):
So I think that directness only works if it's two-way. If it is one person being really direct with another person and then the other person being afraid to talk, you will end up in probably a not great relationship where communication is only going one way and both people will be in their own head. The person being direct will be like, "Why is the other person not responding to my feedback?" And then the other person will be like, "Why am I the only one getting so much feedback?" Meta, where I used to work, had this phrase, "Feedback as a gift," and I so deeply believe in this. And in order to really lean into that phrase and really embody it, I think it's really important that feedback is this constantly flowing thing, not something that happens once or twice a year when you have an official feedback cycle.

Mihika Kapoor (00:30:57):
And the way that I try and create this culture of constant direct communication, constant feedback is if you have feedback to give someone else, I think you can start by asking, "Hey, do you have feedback from me?" And kind of taking the feedback first so then that person feels like, "Okay, maybe I have my way of seeing this situation. Let me communicate that and get off my chest." And then when you give your feedback, it's sort of even. And then feedback in my opinion is something that you should always act on. So then to the extent that you can as soon as possible put that into effect and be like, "Okay, I'm hearing this. I'm going to do XYZ in order to combat that." I think then that incentivizes the other person to do the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
Okay, let me quickly summarize what we've gone through so far in our archaeological study, and then I'm going to drill into a specific trait. So one is just having a really powerful vision that people get really excited about. And the way you described it is kind of find an insight about how you think people could be, in this example, how people could be working maybe through this brainstorm approach and then kind of expanding that into something where this is what would happen if we achieve this in the future, and this is what the world could look like, and that's something people get really excited about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):
So kind of creating compelling vision, being able to communicate it with, and in your experience, communicating with prototypes and mocks is the way that you find it to be most effective. Also, just getting to strong conviction, whether it's real or not, but it sounds like it's actually very genuine about an idea and making it clear. You're very excited about this and here's how it's going to be amazing for the business and the company, and here's why you should be excited about it. Also, you talked about being very direct and being very honest and basically radical candor as some people describe it. First of all, is there anything else I missed specifically before I drill into one of these?

Mihika Kapoor (00:32:47):
That sounds right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
Okay, cool. So kind of along these lines, something else that came up a bunch of in my emails with folks that you work with is how you build hype really effectively, and you talked about this a bit of just creating momentum about an idea. So you got this idea, get everyone pitch it, get everyone excited, and then it just continues to build hype and momentum. So a quote from Karl Jiang, who is on your team maybe, he said, "I feel no PM has ever got me so hyped about a feature." And Yuhki said that you overcome people's doubts by building hype and hacking hype is the way described it. Talk about this and why do you think it's important and how you actually go about doing this.

Mihika Kapoor (00:33:31):
When you are spearheading an idea or a product, it's really on you to have a pulse on how everyone else is feeling about that product. And different products need different levels of excitement to make it out the door. If there is something that leadership has really strong conviction in, it's important for leadership to amp the whole company up behind that vision. On the flip side, if you yourself are pushing a zero to one idea from the bottoms up, the onus is even more on you to make sure that that project and that product is constantly propped up and that people are excited about it to make it out the door. And so one example is we've been talking about this product that I'm working on. And coming out of winter break this year, there's this sense, or at least I always suspect, that there's this sense of over winter break, everyone forgets what happened last year. It goes at the door because you were hopefully doing something that took your mind off work.

Mihika Kapoor (00:34:43):
And so at the same time, there's this sense of how do you create forward momentum inside of a company in January when people are slowly coming back into office, everyone's trickling back in at different dates because everyone to click slightly different PTO, how do you rally people in a certain direction? And so we have this thing at Figma called SKO or Sales Kickoff, which is every year the sales team comes together, and we have a keynote and a set of fireside chats and stuff like that, and we talk about what's coming for the year. And at this point, our product, it existed, but it was absolutely barely built. It was rough around the edges. It had bugs every day. Maybe 10 people in the company were using it and something like that outside of the team.

Mihika Kapoor (00:35:37):
Yeah, it was so important to me that this product got visibility in this forum because this was the first company-wide forum of the year where we were declaring priorities for the year. And so it was so important to me that this product had some sort of a moment, or speaking of show, don't tell, a demo in the context of this keynote. And so Kris, our CTO and Yuhki, our CPO, were giving this keynote on what does our year look like? And I really, really deeply insisted that we should include a demo. And I think what ended up happening is something like that, a demo that wasn't meant to be a demo or that people weren't expecting does so much in terms of driving that sense of hype and helping people see what you yourself see in the future. And what's really interesting is I think that hype is something that... You can't really create hype for something you don't believe in my opinion. The only way to create hype is to get people to see what you see.

Mihika Kapoor (00:36:50):
And so I think that it's incredibly important to leverage very large forums like that Maker Week, like Sales Kickoff. We have CONFIG, which is our annual showcase to the world of what we're working on in order to get everyone to see what you're seeing and to be really scrappy about it and to really be the person who's pushing your product to its limits in the right moments. And I think what you find is that if you push your product to get visibility, maybe even beyond what the current stage of product development merits is that you have really incredible learnings because the more that you can put your product in front of people and get them to use it, the more signal you get on how it's trending. And so what ended up happening was something that could have originally been perceived as a distraction to the team actually ended up being something that added so much fuel to the fire in terms of, one, giving us product insights to inform our next steps. And two, getting the entire company to feel truly, deeply feel excited about getting this thing out the door.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):
And this pitch and product you're describing is the one that's going to be launching this mysterious new product, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:38:03):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
I feel like we're going to build so much hype for this thing when it ever comes out. I'm so excited to learn what it is. Coming back to the point, so what I'm hearing essentially is you find it's important to take responsibility for this thing to become a thing at a company. A lot of people have an idea, they build a prototype, they build a hackathon project, and then they're like, "God, no one's ever doing anything with it. It's not going anywhere. Nothing ever happens." What I'm hearing is it's on you to get people excited about it and find these opportunities to get people excited about it. And there's also this, what I'm feeling is the feels is really important. It's like you have all the data probably. There's probably a logical case for this that you've made across the company, but what you're describing here is you need to get people hyped about it in a emotional, visceral way and basically find opportunities to do that is kind of a lesson here.

Mihika Kapoor (00:38:52):
In my mind, there is internal hype, which is how do you get buy-in and everyone inside of the company to be fanging their fist on the table for a product to get built, but there's also external hype, which is like how do you get your users hyped about your product? How do you get them to really be so stoked when there are milestone occasions for your product or milestone launches and for them to be celebrating with you? And one of the things that I loved the most when I joined the company was Figma and design Twitter have had this very symbiotic relationship where each has grown with the other over time. And what really happens is anytime we launch something, you have all of design Twitter celebrating with us.

Mihika Kapoor (00:39:38):
And one other moment when I thought it was very fun to drive hype was when I worked on FigJam in 2022. It was the one year FigJam anniversary in April, and project anniversaries or product anniversaries are quite an exciting milestone within the company. You bring everyone together, maybe you pop a bottle of champagne, you kind of celebrate how far you've come and what all you've learned since the launch. But we were really thinking like, "Okay, FigJam is awesome, but FigJam isn't just any product. Figjam has a personality. FigJam is cheeky. FigJam is fun. FigJam has this cute skeuomorphism going on where you feel like it's your friend. And so okay, how would you celebrate that moment for a friend?" You wouldn't really have an anniversary party. You would throw it a full on birthday party.

Mihika Kapoor (00:40:34):
And so what we basically did was at the one year anniversary of FigJam, I worked with the marketing team and our engineering team in order to basically kick off a mini launch inside of the product of a bunch of new features. And what we did was we Easter egged them through the product and each sort of product that we were releasing inside of FigJam was hidden under this little birthday present. And throughout the day, we sent all of our users on an Easter egg hunt of presents inside of FigJam. And so not only was a FigJam getting the presents, but it was our users getting the presents. I think that hype as well is really tied to emotion. So to the extent that a person using a product can feel like, "Oh, this thing that is built in the product was built for me not to advance the company's goals or anything like that, but to make me feel special, to make me feel happy."

Mihika Kapoor (00:41:34):
I think that's a really key instrument in driving hype as well. And I think that something that's quite interesting about hype and getting your users to feel strongly about your product is that every product has their own brand of delight or excitement or energy. So hype for FigJam is incredibly different than hype from Figma, where hype for Figma might be this really, really niche design capability that unlocks this pain point that designers have been having for years and years. And then hype for Apple might be like the world's best unboxing experience or something like that. And so leaning into a product's brand in order to figure out what is the optimal way to generate hype with your audience and form that connection is something that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):
I love that example. Something else I'm finding as a thread throughout all of the lessons and stories he shares is just an immersion in your user base and truly knowing what they're excited about, what problems they have, and you talk about having strong conviction and painting a grand vision. It's one thing if someone that doesn't do that does that, it's just like, why would I believe them? Versus someone that like you, where you're just constantly talking to users and actually understand what they need. So I guess the question here is just what advice would you share with folks to build that, to be immersed with users? What do you actually do? How do you actually do that? Are you just organizing meetings, events? Are you scheduling chats? How do you do this?

Mihika Kapoor (00:43:03):
Yeah, so I think it honestly depends on the product. So when I worked at Meta, it was so easy. Everyone and their mom had opinion about the product, which was really great because it meant that anyone you met, you could kind of ask them what they liked, what they didn't like. You can relay that through the company, et cetera. Now at Figma, we have a slightly more niche audience. I think that hopefully, ultimately we get to everyone. We started with design teams, now we're thinking about the entire product development cycle and how we can build for that, and then who knows, beyond that could be anything. But I think that constantly immersing yourself in those circles where your users are is really important. So for me, it's like anytime that I'm catching up with a friend, who mildly works in tech or a tech adjacent field, I will generally be asking them about Figma. And I think what's really great is that as a company scales over time, their user base gets broader and broader. And so when we grew from a single product company with Figma into now a multi product company with FigJam, dev mode, etc, our audience exploded. And we already saw latent behavior inside of Figma, but now it's even more clear how wide reaching the product is. And so something that I find incredibly useful is to not just ask users of your product what they think about your product, but to ask non-users about your product, why they're not using your product. And actually I think that those are the most insightful conversations because I think that having a product shine and having a product do well and have great adoption isn't just about the product being great. It's also about the marketing and the perceptions that surround the product and potentially the hype that surrounds that, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:45:01):
And so having those conversations about... I remember having an early conversation with folks from my previous team about, "Hey, are you guys using FigJam?" And they would be like, "Maybe sometimes." And I'd be like, "Well, why aren't you using FigJam? It's literally built for you." And then that led to a series of product insights that led us to invest in a set of features that would make it much easier for a non-designer to get started out on the canvas. So we launched this kind of placeholder experience that rather than traditional templates, really let people see the various use cases and preview the various use cases on the canvas. And so that was incredibly important. And then Figma, of course, is kind of like it's in this pro-sumer space where it's like you talk to anyone in tech and maybe they're your top total addressable market.

Mihika Kapoor (00:45:48):
But then there are some products I know that people work on which are very removed from the average person, you have infra products, security products and things like that, where you can't just walk up to someone and have a conversation with them about why aren't they using your product because that conversation might not make any sense. And so in those instances, I think that what's really important is it depends on the stage of company that you're at. If you're at an early stage company, you need to be the one going out there and having conversations with your users and just literally looking up your users through whatever channels necessary and figuring out how you can connect with them. I think this is also why founder market fit at startups is so important is because to the extent that you can use yourself as a limits test for what user needs there are, that helps you move really fast in the product development cycle.

Mihika Kapoor (00:46:40):
And then if you're on the larger side, I think that having a really tight relationship with your sales team is really important. And basically, just being on sales calls because you want to be in a situation where the customer pain points on sales calls are cross pollinating into the product roadmap, and you also want to ensure that your sales team has visibility into what might be coming and are constantly informing that. And so I think really leaning into that, building that relationship between these traditionally more siloed orgs and hopping on those calls is something that I'd really recommend.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
Awesome. Let's go actually one layer deeper here. So you're talking to people all the time about FigJam, "Aren't you using FigJam? What do you think of Figma? What do think of this?" You're hopping on sales calls. What do you do with what you hear? Is there kind of an operational approach where you... Do you just put in your head and sticks in your head and rolls around and comes up, things emerge? Do you have a place you put these insights, you're learning? Are you putting post-its in FigJam, for example. And then on the sales side, do you have a cadence where I'm going to join a sales call once a week, here's a person I love in sales, I'm going to try to join all the calls. How do you actually operationalize these things?

Mihika Kapoor (00:47:50):
The insights get operationalized in a number of ways. So first is... So yeah, let's continue using FigJam as an example. I think, like I mentioned, Figma as a company uses FigJam for everything. Multiple FigJam files are made per day, per meeting, et cetera. We had this initial situation where people outside of the company were mostly using FigJam for brainstorms. And so as we were scaling our FigJam sales team, I sort of set up a recurring cadence with the folks in our sales team in order to understand like, "Okay, what are you guys hearing?" And then I would share what was coming, and then I would use their input as signal as to what should be prioritized or deprioritized on the roadmap. And they would use my signal to understand what were the various use cases that they could be pushing with the customers.

Mihika Kapoor (00:48:45):
And one thing that happened during one of the meetings was I literally walked them through, this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In this meeting, this is how I use FigJam, blah, blah, blah. And what that resulted in was I actually made a Loom video walking through my weekend FigJam, that our sales team later distributed to a bunch of companies to inspire them as to like, "Hey, not only can you use FigJam for this, you can use Fig Jam for X, Y, Z. You can use it for your team pickups. You can use it for your retros. You can use it for planning your mom's birthday party. You can use it for planning your all hands. You can use it for sketching out the contents of what's going to go into your next deck," so on and so forth. And so it basically manifests in two way, the first is having it inform the prioritization of your product roadmap.

Mihika Kapoor (00:49:35):
And then the second is what ideally creating artifacts that the sales team can use to evangelize the things that you are seeing and the stepping stones to that vision that you creating. And then the last thing is that sometimes the conversations aren't immediately actionable, right? Sometimes the sales team has an insight or has a request that is just objectively not feasible because the team has too much on its plate. Conversely, sometimes the team might have a suggestion for something that might be pitched to sales folks that's too early given the stage of the conversation. And for that, we basically have... We store it in Asana basically. We have this integration, which many companies might have, which is like Slack integration, where you can react with an Asana emoji, and then any piece of feedback that comes in from sales or from the rest of the company gets turned into a task in your backlog, and then you do a weekly grooming of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:33):
Amazing. Cool. Very tactical and useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):
Another thread that I've noticed, and I wasn't planning to go in this direction, but you just care so deeply about the things you work on. You actually really, really love it and want it to be incredibly successful and feels like you're just always thinking about it. Reminding me of this quote from your colleague Karl, they shared that, "It feels like you care deeply, which makes me care deeply. Who wants to be led by someone who doesn't care about what they're building?" It feels like that's an important part of the way you work and think. Is there anything you want to say about that?

Mihika Kapoor (00:52:01):
When I started out my product career, I actually-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
... About that.

Mihika Kapoor (00:52:03):
When I started out my product career, I actually joined as a RPM, or rotational product manager, at Meta, which was effectively a program that brought together new grad PMs, so people who had zero PM experience and taught them how to be PMs. And, in the beginning of this program, we had a series of conversations with leaders across the company. And, one particularly notable conversation was with Julie Zhu, who was the first ever intern at Meta and the VP of design. And, she was giving us feedback and advice about how to draft compelling product strategy, etc. And, something she said that has stuck with me throughout my entire product career is that when two people disagree about product strategy, it is because they have different assumptions. Because, if you have the same assumptions, there is no reason why a person should think, "We should do X versus we should do Y." And so, it's like, "Okay, how does this relate to what you were just asking about feeling deeply and caring about what you're building?"

Mihika Kapoor (00:53:11):
I think that it's really important to not just build a roadmap because it's handed to you, or not just build an idea because it's handed to you. I think that you need to understand in the event that it's a top-down strategy, what are the assumptions that led to folks believing that that is the right idea? And then, if it is you pushing something bottoms up, you need to be able to ensure that everyone else has the same assumptions that you have in your head that leads them to believe deeply or not believe deeply. And I think what's really important is that people can, to Carl's point, gauge someone is about a project. And, my take is that, the more you believe in an idea, the more natural it is to be passionate about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:02):
I imagine people listening to this will feel like, "Oh shit, I don't really love what I'm working on. I don't work at Figma. I don't have the best of most amazing products." Maybe it's hard to get excited about stuff. Is there anything you could share there? Just say you're working on something that you're not so passionate about, is it a fine thing, keep searching, or is it just figure out something you're excited about? Any advice there for someone in that boat?

Mihika Kapoor (00:54:25):
My first piece of advice would be to not just think about the scope of what you are working on as the thing that happens to be in flight at any given moment. But, if you're working in a company, take a step back, understand the vision of that company, and understand your users, and understand if there's anything in that space that you are passionate about. I think it's quite easy to believe that the project that you're working on is your scope. My take is that your scope is the world, and to the extent that you can figure out does the idea that you're passionate about fall within your company, versus fall outside of your company, that should guide the next steps in your career. And so, I think that potentially common misconception is that founding something is just for capital F founders, but I think that anyone can found something. You can found something inside of an existing company, you can found something from scratch. And, there are different reasons why you would do each, right?

Mihika Kapoor (00:55:43):
The reasons why you would found inside of an existing company is if you think that there is a distribution advantage that you want to take advantage of, if there is a technical or platform advantage that you want to take advantage of. Or, there's also a reality which is it's slightly less risk. So, depending on what your risk tolerance is, you can figure out what makes sense. There are things that are harder inside of an existing company, right? It's harder to take an executive decision. You actually cannot take an executive decision. You need to receive buy-in on every single decision that you make. Sometimes it's harder to move faster. And then sometimes, there are things that are just different when you're starting inside of an existing company, versus starting something outright.

Mihika Kapoor (00:56:27):
So the things that are different is building a team is quite different. The way that you recruit and the set of folks that you can recruit from, that composition is quite different. And then, the way that you pitch and who you are pitching to is quite different. And so, I think that sometimes, yeah, it makes sense to found inside of a company and to use that to make your flame burn, right? Sometimes it makes sense to found outright. But I think that the first key to being passionate about what you're working on is to find an idea that you're passionate about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:01):
I love this as a metaphor of the flame where it applies both to you as a person at a company and keeping that flame going and building it. And then also the idea and a project that accompanies little flame that you're growing over time, building momentum around. So you've hinted at this whole idea of starting zero to one and building new products within larger companies, which I want to get to. We've gone really deep on a bunch of awesome stuff and I'm really happy we did. There's four more skills of things you're amazing at. So here's an idea, let me share the four. How about you pick two that you're most passionate about that you think you have the most advice to share, and then we'll just do those, and then we'll go to what you've learned about building something completely new at a larger company? How does that sound?

Mihika Kapoor (00:57:40):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:42):
Okay. So, from folks that you work with, the four other skills, things you're amazing at, and I still want to hear the things you think you're not amazing at. One is creativity, that you have really creative solutions to problems. Two is empathy. You're really strong at empathizing with users and using that to build amazing products. Three is culture. Sho tells me you're the culture carrier at Figma, which is amazing, because the culture there from what I hear is amazing. And then, four is dealing with change. You're amazing at just like, "Okay, cool. Priorities are changing. Great, let's go. Here we go." Which of those two feel most interesting to you?

Mihika Kapoor (00:58:21):
Maybe we can do the latter two, because they're a little bit different than the other things we've been discussing. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):
Sounds great. So, I guess culture. Let me start there. Okay, so yeah, Sho called you the culture carrier Figma. I hear there's some fun things you all do there. There's something called the hot seat, there's something called the Figgies. First of all, can you maybe explain these two things? And then just broadly, what you find is important about focusing on culture as a PM?

Mihika Kapoor (00:58:49):
Yeah, I can definitely talk about those two things. So, hot seat is actually a tradition I started at our first PM offsite post-pandemic. So this was March of 2022. The PM team was sub-15 people at that point, and we all fit around a dinner table, which is no longer true today. And, it was really important to me that we all got to know each other in a context that was outside of work. I think that PMing is a highly collaborative function. And, to the extent that you have great relationships with all the teams that you're interfacing with, one is it goes a long way in terms of the product, but two, speaking about passion, it makes your day-to-day so much more fun if you feel like you're working with your friends, and if you are working with your friends.

Mihika Kapoor (00:59:39):
And so, we were coming out of a long intense day session, and I was thinking about, "Okay, how do we break the ice?" And, hot seat is this game where you go around the table and each person gets two minutes on the clock and everyone else at the table can ask them anything. And if they want to, they can decline to answer. But we try and keep it, generally speaking, quite friendly and comfortable for folks. And so, we kicked off this game. And, what was really interesting was earlier that day we had done a personality test, as a side note, our PM team is obsessed with personality tests.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Which personality test, by the way?

Mihika Kapoor (01:00:19):
We to this day say the best one was the one that we did at this offsite, which is the Strengths Finder test. And, what had basically happened was over the course of that morning, we had all dug into... We were saying, "What are our strengths? What are our weaknesses?" Etc. And we had this really fun foundation to build on during the game of hot seat, where it was like, we were digging into like, "What about people's backgrounds made them think the way that they do today? And, what random anecdote at age seven of playing catch with their dad in the field led to how they thought about auto layout? Blah, blah, blah, blah." And, I think that being able to understand what motivates a person is so important when you're working with them, and also just in building a connection with them. And so, that was this moment that really brought the whole team together.

Mihika Kapoor (01:01:09):
Something that I was really gratified to hear after is that, since then, hot seat has become a tradition within the company. And so, all the PMs went on to play it with their own teams. Yuki and Sho went on to play it with the exec team, so on and so forth. And so, it's become this thing that now anytime that someone joins the team, okay, you put them in the hot seat. And then, if you're meeting someone's significant other, you put them in the hot seat. And it's this thing that is just totally spread, but it's a really fun way to just get to know folks and what drives them. So, that's one of my favorites. I highly recommend.

Mihika Kapoor (01:01:42):
The second thing that you asked about, which was the Figgies. And, this is basically an Oscar style awards ceremony that was hacked together. And so, where the Figgies was inspired from was actually every year we have... I was mentioning like SKO, our sales kickoff. And, on the last night of SKO, there's this award ceremony, where they appreciate all of the incredible work that has taken place in the sales and marketing org. And I saw this and I was like, "This is incredible. We should absolutely be celebrating the product team as well when we're together." And so, what I did was I basically took our Figma boardroom, which is called Bigma, and worked with another PM Elan to deck it out, and a red carpet, gold curtains, etc. And we bought little Oscar trophies for everyone, and got their names written on it, and voted people in for all of these absurd categories, like most likely to name their child Figma, most likely to go their career without writing a PRD. Blah, blah, blah.

Mihika Kapoor (01:02:55):
And, of course, forced everyone to give some acceptance speech. But, I think that making people feel appreciated for even just the quirks and the energy that they bring to the team is something that's incredibly important. And celebrating that diversity together is something that I think goes a long way in terms of making people feel close, and also making people understand maybe someone who they don't know that well on the PM team, because then you learn, "Okay, beyond them having this Zoom background, this is what's cheeky about them. Or this is what's interesting or unique about them." And so, I think that culture is so important. Figma has this core value called play, which I love, which really emphasizes just that everyone should be having fun at all times, and work should be fun, and gathering should be fun. And I think that I personally am a huge believer in this remote first role that we live in, you also want to take advantage of those times when you're able to get together and do things that make the team feel geographically close, even when they're geographically spread out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh man, it's so fun. And I love that it's just like, you did this, right? It's not like Dylan is adding all these rituals to the team. It's very bottom up. And, in theory, any PM on the team could have done this.

Mihika Kapoor (01:04:21):
It's interesting, something that I had heard, Vishal Shah, who was the former head of product at Instagram say, is that, often in companies culture is set top down, and then the innovation that comes out of that is bottoms up. And so, I think in the first place, having a value like play does a lot in order to make folks feel like these things are celebrated and time should be carved out for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
To come back to your original point of just culture is everything, a lot of PMs are like, "I have so much work to do. I have so many things to do. I'm just working all day every day." What can you tell them about why this is so important and worth putting some time into? And should everybody? Or is it just like, "If you're excited about this, do it. If not, don't worry"?

Mihika Kapoor (01:05:06):
I think culture is important in that it establishes trust between groups of people. And so, I think that actually earlier you were asking about passion and what makes someone feel passionate about work. And I think realistically, that passion breaks down into two things. One is, are you passionate about the vision that you're building towards? Which we spoke about. But the second thing is, are you passionate about the people who you work with?

Mihika Kapoor (01:05:35):
And, I think that roadmaps change, products change, but feeling a connection to the folks that you're working with make you much more durable as a team. It means that when times get tough, which they will, your gut instinct is to rally together and collaborate together to find a solution, rather than to jump ship or something. I think personally, I'm in love with my team. They give me so much joy and happiness on a daily basis. I was telling them the other day that when they post prototypes in our Slack channel, sometimes I get little flutters in my chest like when you have a crush on someone. And, I think that having that emotional connection to your team is fun. And I think that emotional connection comes from investing in culture.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:26):
And again, it's like, you did it. You made it happen, right? It's not like, "Oh, this sucks. My team's no fun." It's like, you can make it more fun. And I think the two examples you shared are awesome, because one is a high-end version where there's a lot of work. And the hot seat, it's just a quick idea that takes no work, just an idea, and then you just ask to do it, and it's there.

Mihika Kapoor (01:06:44):
Okay, so actually, I want to combat the perception that the Figgy's was a high production, high cost thing. It was very low cost. I ordered everything on Amazon and assembled it in an hour. And so, there are ways to be scrappy in making things come together. And so, I would say, don't be intimidated by any idea of being too large to take on. Just go for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:08):
That's an awesome correction. Okay, final trait you're great at. Somebody shared that you pivot with grace and enthusiasm when things change and priorities change, projects are killed, projects are spun up. There's something that a lot of people at companies just get so sad about, "Oh my God, things keep changing. My project's killed. Oh, this priority changed." It feels like you've learned to make that a superpower. What can you share about what you've learned there and how to leverage that into doing great and being successful?

Mihika Kapoor (01:07:40):
For this one, I could actually maybe give an example that preceded my product career, which was, when I was in college, I actually founded a national design conference for students across the country. And the way that this came about was when I was in college, design was very much having a watershed moment in tech. So, companies like Airbnb and Pinterest were leading an industry and they were leading not just because they built technology and made it accessible, but because they were really using the interface layer to differentiate. So there was this point where software had reached a certain level of saturation, where things that were not possible were now suddenly possible, and now suddenly possible in multiple companies. And design became this differentiator, which is really exciting. But at the same time, none of this was reflected in most schools across the country.

Mihika Kapoor (01:08:39):
And so, I went to Princeton and there was nothing that resembled product design in our curriculum. And this was baffling to me, because I was like, "There is such clear momentum..." Speaking about momentum in industry about this being a profession that is so important and so influential in building the next generation of companies. Yet, the groundwork to make that happen wasn't really there. And then, I interned at Facebook, and I realized that my entire class of 25 interns had very similar experiences, where they too were self-taught product designers. And so, that summer, I actually watched a documentary that was coincidentally produced by Envision that featured folks like John Maeda, amongst others, and was talking about how design changed the world that we lived in, and was going to rewrite the future, which I really believed in. And so, I was incentivized to found this conference called Design Nation that would democratize access to a design education and bring together top students from across the country with industry leaders.

Mihika Kapoor (01:09:43):
And originally, my plan was to build this within an organization that already existed at Princeton, because they had the funding, they had the resources, they had the expertise in order to make this a reality. And then, what actually ended up happening was they too were skeptical of the business value of design and didn't think it would be possible for something like this to be funded. And so, I went from building something in a situation where I thought finances, expenditures, connections, et cetera, were totally taken care of, to having none of that and needing to build it from the ground up.

Mihika Kapoor (01:10:18):
And, it was funny, one of the best pieces of advice I got in college was, don't underestimate the power for .edu email address. And I just went on a spree, cold emailing so many people, so many executives about this problem that I was trying to solve. And, what actually ended up happening was people would hop on the phone with me, and a lot of the folks who I spoke to, designers who I really admire, like Daniel Burke, Jamie [inaudible 01:10:46], et cetera, were folks who would be like, "Oh my God, this was such a problem when I was in college. Of course I'll help you solve it. I can't believe it hasn't been solved yet."

Mihika Kapoor (01:10:56):
And so, ultimately, it grew into this conference that lasted many years, brought together folks from originally around the country, then more recently around the world. And ultimately, did live under that broader organization. But I think, having the ability to, in the absence of formal backing or something, still chase after something and maybe pivot the way that you're thinking about it, or pivot the way that you are allocating your own time. Maybe suddenly speakers is not the most important thing, fundraising is the most important thing. Or, building a hype landing page so that you seem more legit than a very scrappy few-person student organization is the most important thing. And just being quite adaptable when it comes to resourcing, I think is very important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:48):
That's an awesome example. It shows another trait, Mahika, in our archeological study, which has come up a bunch, and I'm just putting my finger on it, is just high agency. It feels like you're just consistently just like, "I'll make this happen myself. This problem exists. We need more product designers in school. I will solve that problem." And I love that. And by the way, Design Nation for folks that want to explore that, how do they find that? And it's still going, right?

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:19):
Yeah. So, you can Google Design Nation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
Okay.

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:24):
And, we have a Instagram page amongst other things. And, yeah, last year we had folks like Stuart Weitzman and Joe Gebbia, who's one of the co-founders of Airbnb come and speak, which was super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:37):
Awesome. And then, who is it for? It's for students? People in college that want to learn to be designers?

Mihika Kapoor (01:12:41):
Yeah, it's for design-driven college students. I think one thing to call out is that one of my focuses in the early years was to ensure that this is for, not just capital D designers, but design driven students. So, we also took engineers who are very design minded and marketers who are very design minded, et cetera, because of that core belief that the most innovative solutions will come out of people that are operating at this intersectionality.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:13):
Okay. So we've talked about all kinds of things you're amazing at. Before we transition to what you've learned about just building new stuff at larger companies, which you're very good at, can you just bullet point the skills you find you're not good at? I said we would come to this. What do you think you're not good at? And we won't go too deep here, unless you want.

Mihika Kapoor (01:13:34):
So it's interesting, because I think that there are many things that we talked about that are actually a double-edged sword in practice. So, let's start with the conviction piece. I think that the good thing about being high conviction is that you're able to sell forward and to get people to feel strongly about something and a next step in the future. I think the downside of that is if there is less of a history of working together, there might be skepticism about like, "Oh, are you just pushing something because you believe in it? Or are you pushing something because our users actually needed it?" And so, in those moments, it becomes really important to constantly be highlighting user proof points.

Mihika Kapoor (01:14:17):
I think, the second is scrappiness. So, I think I have a very high ability to thrive in ambiguity and to pull things together last minute. So, for example, it's very common that I am editing a product review deck minutes before we are about to present, or that I haven't started until the night before and stay up until 3:00 AM to do it. And this is somewhat fine. But then, I think that other people don't always love it, because they're like, "Hey, maybe let's start earlier next time." I get that. The third piece would be I get very consumed by the details of something. And I think in a lot of instances, this is great. Also, at a certain point, sometimes you want to defer those decisions. And so, that's also an important skill to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):
Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that. This touches on something that came up in a previous podcast episode. Nikhil from Meta had this really interesting metaphor, where every superpower has a shadow. Basically, everything you're amazing at, there's something that'll be a problem, a liability basically for you. And so, I think, what you're pointing out is you're amazing at some of these things, but there's downsides. And I think that's really important for people to know. And we already talked about just something you believe that I also believe, it's just, you'll have things you're not good at, focus on things you're amazing at, and just getting better at those things, and use that to achieve, because it ends up being a lot more.

Mihika Kapoor (01:15:48):
Also, building off of that is as you scale your team, it's really important to be self-aware of what those blind spots are and to hire for that. Because, you want individuals to be spiky and you want team to be well-rounded.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:06):
That's a great segue to talking about building completely new things at large companies. So, what I hear is you're the go-to person for zero-to-one stuff at Figma, which is incredible. Figma is one of the most admired, successful tech companies in the world. And, you're the person people look to build completely new stuff. So, first of all, why are you so passionate about this stuff? Why do you want to be working on brand new stuff like this? And why is it important for companies to be good at this?

Mihika Kapoor (01:16:37):
In order for a company to stay competitive, a company needs to stay entrepreneurial. If you are not constantly thinking about what's next, defining the industry standard, seeing around the corner from your competitors, you will get taken over. That is a reality. And so, consequently, I personally love to screen for very entrepreneurial companies and companies that have that culture. And so, Figma has this huge run with it culture, where run with it is also one of our core values, and it's really encouraged that people can just sprint off in a direction that is seen not as a distraction, but rather a manifestation of the company's values.

Mihika Kapoor (01:17:22):
And so, at the company, some of our most monumental launches have come out of hackathons and have come out of bottoms up projects. So recently, this week we had a launch of Multi-edit, which was a long clamored for a feature where folks can edit things across multiple frames at the same time. That was a multi-year, multi-product long initiative. We have things like Jambot, which is an AI plugin inside of FigJam that has come out of an AI hackathon that we had last year. Our entire widgets platform was originally a hackathon project. And so, there's this culture of celebrating things-

Mihika Kapoor (01:18:03):
... project. And so there's this culture of celebrating things that have been pushed bottoms up. And so constantly thinking about how can people within the company be entrepreneurial, both in terms of getting new products up to users and in terms of improving internal processes, is just a culture that you constantly want to be facilitating and leading into.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):
Awesome. And clearly, Figma is very good at this. Let's dive a little deeper. Say, somebody wants to make their culture more entrepreneurial or wants to become better at this individually, maybe just broadly, what does it take to do this well, to go from idea to, "Okay, that's a huge new product for a business"? What have you learned just broadly, what are kind of the steps or the important elements of that, well?

Mihika Kapoor (01:18:46):
I think that there's this interesting metaphor that you were calling out earlier about a zero-to-one project being like a flame. And flames are interesting, because they're sort of destined to die at the end of the day. And I think about the person who is pushing a zero-to-one idea as kind of being the keeper of the flame.

Mihika Kapoor (01:19:13):
And in particular, there's this metaphor that really sticks with me, which is in Greek mythology, all the gods sit on Mount Olympus, and there's this Goddess Hestia who is the keeper of the hearth, and it is her job to always keep the hearth burning, even when all the gods peace out to go on their various quests. And I kind of think about the person or the team or the group of people who are pushing a zero-to-one idea as being the Hestias or the keepers of the hearth. And it is your job to stoke the flames and the embers if they are at risk of dying out. And it is also your job to ensure that the idea can spread like wildfire and can build that level of hype you need for an entire company or an entire set of people to be clamoring for something to get built.

Mihika Kapoor (01:20:04):
And so more concretely, I think that there are three things you need to do in order to be successful at bringing an idea into existence. The first is you need to have the right idea, right? And that's the empathy piece. That's the piece that you will get from having conversations day in, day out with your users. The second is you need to secure buy-in for that idea. So that's the vision piece. You need to be able to rally an entire set of folks, but honestly, most importantly, your leadership and your team behind an idea. And then, the third is you need to be able to make it spread like that wildfire. You need to get it to a point where someone joins the company and they're like, "Oh, what is that flame burning there? And how can I learn more about that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:50):
Coming up with a great idea, getting buy-in for your idea, and then spreading it within the organization, what have you learned about how to actually come up with an idea that is actually a good idea?

Mihika Kapoor (01:20:59):
So it's funny because the current product that I'm working on actually came out of a conversation or a set of conversations where I was pitching FigJam to people. And so kind of speaking about constantly having these user conversations, I think in order to have the right idea, there are two key elements. The first is you need to have that user empathy. You need to be constantly having conversations with your users, diving into what are their pain points, not only about the product that you're working on, but general perceptions about your company and also general perceptions about the other tools or products that they might be using on a daily basis. It's not enough to have a perspective on how well you are competing in the market, but you also need to know, like understand a person's full end-to-end tooling usage.

Mihika Kapoor (01:21:48):
And then, the second thing is you need to ensure that what you're kind of working towards ladders into a company goal. And so something that's very top of mind at Figma or something that has been very top of mind at Figma has been how do we go from building for designers to covering the entire product development cycle and expanding to non-designers in particular. And non-designers is kind of this bucket term that we use for PMs and developers and marketers and so on and so forth, but how can we ensure that our tooling suite is reflective of all the different stakeholders that make the product development process what it is, and so I think that, yeah, just constantly having the conversation with the users and also constantly being anchored around not what are you currently working on, but what is the broader company goal is something that will help you come up with the right idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:48):
Such an important point, basically understanding the business, not just, "Here's my feature, here's my product, or here's what feels like a great cool thing to build." Okay, so that's the idea getting buy-in. What have you learned about how to do that? Well, clearly, you've been very successful, because we've talked about a lot of these things, building hype, creating a big vision. What else there that we haven't talked about that you think is really important?

Mihika Kapoor (01:23:12):
I think the key to being successful at zero-to-one is to honestly have optimism that borders on delusion. You need to have insane, almost like reality distortion field where you don't hear the word no, or at the very least, you translate it into a not yet. And so I think that in terms of pitching, I'll be honest, my first few pitches of this idea were not successful. What basically happened was kind of like both conviction, the idea by talking to users, and then I would have ad hoc conversations with folks around the company, and I would be like, "We should do this." And they would be like, "Maybe." And I would be like, "Okay, what am I seeing? What are they not seeing?" And then, what basically happened was we had a PM off-site where we were talking about strategy for the next year. And I, again, pitch this, and it got kind of momentum there, but not really.

Mihika Kapoor (01:24:15):
And then, I think the third time when it actually stuck was at the Maker Week hackathon. And this was kind of an insane experience for me, because I was actually hosting our hackathon. So I was kind of working with our VP of design, Noah, in order to spread the word about like, "Hey, everyone pitch your ideas." And to constantly, hackathons are interesting when they're virtual, right? Because you don't really know what people not in your office are doing, right? So you're constantly thinking about like, "Okay, how can you hype up the whole company, right? How can you hype up the SF office with what people are building in New York? And how can you ensure that London stays included even though there's a limited time zone overlap," and things like that. And so I was simultaneously thinking about, "Okay, how do we keep the momentum of this hackathon running? And then, also, how do I push this idea bottoms up?"

Mihika Kapoor (01:25:05):
And I think that something that's really important when you're making a pitch is to not be daunted by the scale of your pitch. So, for example, in this instance, the proposal was basically to introduce a new product. And building a product in a week is for all intents and purposes kind of crazy, but this is I think where the scrappiness piece comes in. You need to be willing to be very clear about where you're willing to take the hit on quality or believability and where you need to push in order to make your thing feel believable. So one example of something that we did was we literally, in order to make this new product feel more real, and this was maybe a two line change in code, was we swapped out the FigJam icon in our file browser to this new icon.

Mihika Kapoor (01:26:00):
And adding a whole new entry point is a lot of work, and you can't do that. But just swapping something and taking about what exists and changing the minor things in order to communicate what is different about your idea versus what exists today is something that you really want to lean into. And what basically happened was that at the end of the week, we had this demo day, and I was going between introducing each of the demos to doing the demo and did a little wardrobe change in between. And I think that what ended up being really great about presenting an idea like this in a company-wide forum, which I highly recommend, is that at that point, it becomes not just you evangelizing the idea, but your teammates and your colleagues and your peers evangelizing the idea. And that sense of momentum carries a lot of weight, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:48):
And this kind of leads into the next bullet point you shared of spreading the idea across the company. It feels like this is part of it just getting it spread in a big powerful way initially. But what else have you learned about just getting this to spread across the company? It gets kind of like this flame spreading throughout the organization.

Mihika Kapoor (01:27:05):
I think something that's very unique about Figma as compared to other companies is we have a multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding process. And so something that was really interesting to me was... One of the first projects that I worked on at the company was we were building sections inside of FigJam. And we had a problem. We built it. We put something on staging, and I was kind of like, "Okay, cool, it's been on staging a week, now we can launch, right?" And I was greeted with like, "No, we can't launch."

Mihika Kapoor (01:27:41):
And I think that leaning into that willingness to being vulnerable about your product and this acknowledgement that feedback is a gift, and that bits and pieces of feedback from across the company will help your product mature and get to a place where it's ready to go out the door is really important. And what's really interesting is this helps the team who's working on the product, because you're getting feedback, and that's the most direct benefit of putting something on staging early.

Mihika Kapoor (01:28:11):
But the other benefit about putting something on staging early is that it makes people invested in your product. So if you think about why are betas so valuable and why are alphas so valuable, it's because when someone gives you feedback, and then the team in charge implements that change, you see that and you're like, "I shaped that part of the product." Right? And to the extent that you can get as many people in the company feeling like they shaped X, Y, Z parts of the product, I think that's really powerful, because, then, you kind of are ensuring that there's this constant feedback loop, and there's this constant investment in thinking about how can we collectively drive towards success, because at the end of the day, product development is a team sport, right? It takes everyone to make something successful. And so I just think about putting things early on staging and getting people involved in the cycle as opening up the doors to the product development process, and hopefully, that just elevates the quality of the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:15):
Is there anything else you want to touch on or share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Mihika Kapoor (01:29:22):
If you have an insight that only you have, I think on one hand, you can kind of believe, "Oh, other people aren't thinking similar to me. Therefore, maybe, I'm wrong," but I would actually flip that, because I think if you have an insight that other people are not seeing, it is even more on you to get people onto the same page. And so to the extent that you can shout from the rooftops about all the insights that you're learning, I think that, in and of itself, creates a more entrepreneurial culture within the company, because chances are other people will see you doing that. They'll be inspired to contribute in the same way as well.

Mihika Kapoor (01:29:58):
I think the last thing that I would say is, which is maybe an aspect that we did not touch on, is that understanding motivations is, in my opinion, one of the keys to running a team successfully and driving an idea forward. So, for example, if you think about the composition of a product team, you have engineers, you have designers, you have researchers, data scientists, et cetera, and different people want to be involved in the kind of product visioning phase to a different extent. There's some people who do want a solution handed to them, because for them, the most exciting part of the process is to find the technical solution in the code. On the other hand, there are other people who find it really hard to feel passionately about a thing that they have not contributed to. And so I think to the extent that you can understand these motivations of your team, of your leadership, of your peers, and constantly ensure that you are catering to the individual, as opposed to the average, that is what, in my opinion, leads to one of the highest-functioning teams.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):
Such a cool point. It comes back to the personality tests that you spoke of earlier. Is that the best way to figure this out? Is it more just watch people and try to guess at what they're most excited about [inaudible 01:31:21]-

Mihika Kapoor (01:31:21):
Oh, I think you have to directly ask them. So anytime someone joins my team, especially on the engineering side, because I think this is where there's the greatest variance, I will literally ask, " How much do you like being involved in product decisions?" And to the extent that you can take decisions in the open, that is excellent. And even if the decision is something along the lines of like, "Okay, we have four options," and you can go in with a leading point of view, but giving everyone the opportunity to voice their perspective and push back, if they want to, I think that that's very powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:03):
Such a good tip. I feel like I could ask you questions for at least two more hours, but we're not going to do that. Maybe, we'll have round two some day. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:14):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:16):
Mihika, first question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:21):
Yeah, I'll start by saying that I am immediately skeptical of anyone who has not read Harry Potter. So, if you're one of those people, go read Harry Potter. Maybe, it contributes to creativity. I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:35):
Now, we're talking about every book in the series, or at least the one book?

Mihika Kapoor (01:32:38):
No, no. You have to read the entire series, and you have to read it in order. It's actually funny, when I was in kindergarten, my mom bought the fifth book, and then the person at the bookstore was like, "No, no." Like, "No, no." We were like, "Okay, got it." And then, the others that I would recommend are from a fiction perspective. I think Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is incredibly beautiful and powerful. It's like a multi-generational Korean saga. I think I'm personally just motivated and moved by large scale things. So to see a single story traverse so many generations was very fascinating to me.

Mihika Kapoor (01:33:17):
And then, from a more businessy book perspective, which is maybe more what you're getting at, I think that I honestly pseudo steer clear of how-to books, but one that has had a particularly large impact on me is Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmull. And this is about the founding story and scaling of Pixar. And what was so interesting to me about this book was it basically talks about how you create a process around cultivating creativity. And it's interesting, because creativity is so unencumbered and process is the opposite, so that's very fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:50):
My favorite lesson from that book is that it sticks with me as the ugly baby metaphor, which feels like so tied to the way you think and operate. And I won't get into it. By the way, have you read The Overstory?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:01):
I have not. I'll add that to my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:04):
I feel like, based on the way you described Pachinko, this is a book for you. It's a multi-generational family story that I did not actually finish. It's very long, but I feel like you were there.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:16):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:16):
There you go.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:16):
I'll go order it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:19):
Okay. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:22):
Favorite recent TV show would definitely be Severance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
Movie, or shall we move on?

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:29):
Oh, movie, I recently watched Dune 2 and Dune 1 in the span of a week. It was really fun. I watched Dune 2, because someone asked me to co-host a premiere of Dune 2 with them, and I was like, "Okay, sounds good, sounds cool, but I need to watch Dune 1."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:44):
Good choice. I just watched Dune 2. I don't know if a more epic movie can be made. I was just gripped.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:50):
The visuals were stunning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:52):
Like not breathing.

Mihika Kapoor (01:34:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:53):
It's out of control. I watched it IMAX. I think that was a good call, but it was stressful. Favorite interview question they like to ask folks when you're hiring.

Mihika Kapoor (01:35:02):
I like to ask people what motivates them, but also, people often ask me, what is my favorite hot seat question, which I think is kind of similar. And my answer to that is that it's highly dependent on the person, and there's no go-to hot seat question. And I almost feel the same way about interview questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:19):
Favorite product you recently discovered that you love?

Mihika Kapoor (01:35:23):
Speaking about hype, I am kind of obsessed with the browser company, Arc onboarding flow, specifically the onboarding flow. I think that they do such a good job of amping you up for not only the larger change that they're trying to make in terms of personal operating system, but of showing you to what extent their team thinks about the details of the product, where a lot of other products might cut corners. And I think their ability to communicate the ethos of their product through that is really powerful. So that's one.

Mihika Kapoor (01:36:01):
And then I think the second is in the AI space. I'm really excited by Pika, which is video generation, video editing software. I think that, in my mind, one of the biggest shortcomings of AI, the way that a lot of people are building it today is that it's optimized for the demo or optimized for the tweet, right? And it's basically this situation where I think about it as, in my mind, one of the biggest goals of AI right now is the black boxification of AI, because it's not really useful to enter a prompt and get an output that you can't interact with, because then it's like, if something's a little bit off, what are you going to do? You're kind of stuck. But I think Pika is doing a really great job of not just investing in the foundational video models, but also giving you the ability to manipulate the output. And so I'm excited about that approach, and I hope that more companies take you from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:55):
Awesome, good choices on Arc. Whenever anyone ask me for a great onboarding follow, that's the one I point people to. And we had Josh Miller on the podcast in the past, and I was proud that he pinned our interview as top of his Twitter feed for a year, which made me really happy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends or family that you find useful in life or in work?

Mihika Kapoor (01:37:19):
Yeah, "Life is a game of expectations." And so speaking of books and movies and things like that, I will never ever watch a movie trailer or read the back cover of a book, because I think it means that you're going into it with too many expectations. It either tells you all the punchlines, or it tells you the foundational backstory or something like that. And I think that, to the extent, that you go in either with no expectations or low expectations, that's the key to enjoying life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:48):
I love that tip. I recently learned the same piece of advice from Kevin Kelly's recent book where it's just a book of little tidbits of advice that he's learned over his life, and one of them is like never watch the trailer if you're going to watch the movie, and I've been doing that ever since. I think that's an awesome piece of advice. Final question. We talked about the Figgy's. You mentioned there's an award for PM least likely to write a PRD. Was that you won the award for chance?

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:10):
I think it was me and Sho tied.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:15):
Okay, great. I guessed correctly. Amazing. Mihika, you're... Everything, I hope you'd be on this podcast, I feel like, we could have talked for, I keep saying this, but at least two more hours maybe, we'll have a follow-up.

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:25):
I'd love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:25):
Thank you so much for being here and for making time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Mihika Kapoor (01:38:33):
Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @mihikapoor. It's kind of my first name and last name smushed together. And in terms of how users can be useful to me, so one is come to Config, we will be announcing both this new product, but also so many cool things that the company is working on. A lot of very exciting AI launches and more. And I think that having the community come together is a very special moment. So hope to see you there. Cough, cough, try the new product when it comes out. And I don't know, I'm always on the lookout for cool new products. I like to be someone who tries things out early, so to the extent that you see things, send them my way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:14):
There's going to be so many people anticipating this new product.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:17):
Oh, no, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:17):
There's going to be like-

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:17):
We should-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:17):
... holy moly.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:19):
Please have low expectations.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:22):
Okay. And the way we'll know is are you pitching and presenting it, or how do we know this is going to be your product once we see it?

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:28):
It'll probably be in the opening keynote, which is done by Dylan, but I'll probably give a Config talk on it as well. So that's how you will know, and I'll probably tweet about it. What I was actually going to do is to release the original vision deck when it launches, so you can look out for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:50):
We'll be watching. I will be at Config.

Mihika Kapoor (01:39:52):
Can't wait to see you there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:54):
Potentially on stage. Can't reveal yet what's happening exactly, but I think it's going to be awesome. Anyway, Mihika, thank you again so much for being here.

Mihika Kapoor (01:40:02):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
90% of your code roughly is written by AI now.

Mike Krieger (00:00:03):
The team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team. They're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted. Over half of our pull requests are Claude Code generated. Probably at this point it's probably over 70% that it just completely blew out the expectations of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You guys are at the edge of where things are heading.

Mike Krieger (00:00:28):
I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open. It was AI 2027, and my product strategy, and it was this moment where I'm like, "Wait, am I the character in the story?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
It feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. How does that inform the way you think about product, strategy, and mission?

Mike Krieger (00:00:43):
I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
What's something that you've changed your mind about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?

Mike Krieger (00:01:01):
I had this notion coming in like, "Yes, these models are great, but are they able to have an independent opinion?" And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Mike Krieger. Mike is chief product officer at Anthropic, the company behind Claude. He's also the co-founder of Instagram. He's one of my most favorite product builders and thinkers. He's also now leading product at one of the most important companies in the world, and I'm so thrilled to have had a chance to chat with him on the podcast. We chat about what he's changed his mind about most in terms of AI capabilities in the years since he joined Anthropic, how product development changes and where bottlenecks emerge when 90% of your code is written by AI, which is now true at Anthropic. Also, his thoughts on OpenAI versus Anthropic, the future of MCP, why he shut down Artifact, his last startup and how he feels about it. Also, what skills he's encouraging his kids to develop with the rise of AI. And we closed the podcast on a very heartwarming message that Claude wanted me to share it with Mike.

Last year, 1.3% of the global GDP flowed through Stripe. That's over $1.4 trillion and driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe. For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software. It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself. For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe. And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management. Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses. From smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond.

(00:04:29):
Mike, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mike Krieger (00:04:32):
I'm really happy to be here. I've been looking forward to this for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):
Wow, I had love to hear that. I've also been looking forward to this for a while. I have so much to talk about. So first of all, you've been at Anthropic for just over a year at this point. Congrats by the way on hitting the cliff.

Mike Krieger (00:04:46):
Thank you. Not that we're tracking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):
That's right. So let me just ask you this. So you've been at Anthropic for about a year. What's something that you've changed your mind about from before you joined Anthropic to today about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?

Mike Krieger (00:05:04):
Two things. One is like a pace and timeline question. The other one is a capability question. So maybe I'll take the second one first. I had this notion coming in, yes, these models are great, they're going to be able to produce code, they're going to be able to write hopefully in your voice eventually, but are they able to sort of have an independent opinion? And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month and only with Opus 4 where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude. And it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, look at it. And in the past it's pretty anodyne kind of comments that it would leave, "Oh, have you thought about this?" And it's like, "Yeah, I thought about that." And Opus 4, I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year was the first one.

(00:05:51):
It was like Opus 4 combined with our advanced research. But it really went out for a while and it came back and I was like, you really looked at it in a new way. And so that's a thing that I've maybe I didn't feel like it would never be able to do that, but I wasn't sure how soon it'd be able to come up with something where I look at it, I'm like, yep, that is a new angle that I hadn't been looking at before and I'm going to incorporate that immediately into how I think about it. So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is, I don't know about independence is the right word, but creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things. But in the timeline, one, it's so interesting because I was sitting next to Dario yesterday and he's like, "I keep making these predictions and people keep laughing at me. And then they come true."

(00:06:31):
And it's funny to have this happen over and over again and he is like, not all of them are going to be right. But even I think as of last year he was talking about we're at 50% on SWE-Bench, which is this benchmark around how well the models are at coding. He's like, "I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that." And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models and we're at 50% when he made that prediction. And it's continued to scale pretty much as predicted. And so I've taken the timelines a lot more seriously now. And I don't know if you read AI 2027-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:05):
I have, it made by heart race.

Mike Krieger (00:07:09):
And I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open, it was AI 2027 and my product strategy. And it was this moment where I'm like, "Wait, am I the character in the story? How much is this converging?" But you read that and you're like, "Oh, 2027, that's years away if you're like no, mid 2025." And things continue to improve and the models continue to be able to do more and more and they're able to act agentically and they're able to have memory and they're able to act over time. So I think my confidence in the timelines and I don't know exactly how they manifest it definitely just solidified over the last year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:43):
Wow. I wasn't expecting to go down that that paper was scary. And I'm curious just I guess I can't help but ask just thoughts on just how do we avoid the scary scenario that paper paints of where AI getting really smart goes?

Mike Krieger (00:07:59):
Yeah, this maybe ties into, I've been here a year, why did I join Anthropic? I was watching the models get better and even you could see it in early 2024, and looking at my kids, I'm like, "All right, they're going to grow up in a world with AI. It's unavoidable." Where can I maximally apply my time to nudge things towards going well? And I mean that's a lot of what people think about across the industry, especially at Anthropic. And so I think coming to an agreement and a shared framework and understanding of what does going well look like? What is the kind of human AI relationship that we want?

(00:08:36):
How will we know along the way? What do we need to build and develop and research along the way? I think those are all the kind of key questions. And some of those are product questions and some of those are research and interpretability questions, but for me it was the strongest reason to join was okay. I think there's a lot of contribution that Anthropic can have around nudging things to go better. And if I can have a part to play there, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):
I love that answer. Speaking of kids, so you've got two kids, I've got a young kid, he's just about to turn two. I'm curious just what skills you're encouraging your kids to build as this AI becomes more and more of our future and some jobs will be changed and just what advice do you have?

Mike Krieger (00:09:18):
We have this breakfast feed breakfast with the kids every morning and sometimes some question will come up, something about physics and our oldest kid's almost six, but they ask funny questions about the solar system or physics or in a 6-year-old way and before we reach for Claude, because at first my instinct is like, "Oh, I wonder how Claude will do this question." And we started changing, "Well, how would we find out?" And the answer can't just be we'll ask Claude, all right, well, we could do this experiment, we could have this thing. So I think nurturing curiosity and still having a sense of, I don't know, the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in a 6-year-old, but that process of discovery and asking questions and then systematically working right through, I think will still be important. And of course AI will be an incredible tool for helping resolve large parts of that, but that process of inquiry I think is still really important and independent thought.

(00:10:11):
My favorite moment with my kid, because she's very headstrong, our 6-year-old, she said something and I wasn't sure if it was true. It was, oh, is that coral is an animal or corals alive? I don't even remember what the details of it. And I was like, "I don't know if that's true." And she's like, "It's definitely true, dad." I'm like, "All right, let's ask Claude on this one." And she's like, "You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right." And I'm like I love that. I want that kind of level of not just delegating all of your cognition to the AI because it won't always get it right. And also it kind of short circuits any kind of independent thought. So the skill of asking questions, inquiry and independent thinking, I think those are all the pieces. What that looks like from a job or occupation perspective, I'm just keeping an open mind and I'm sure that'll radically change between now and then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
It's interesting. Tobias Lütke, Shopify CEO, on the podcast and he had the same answer for what he's encouraging his kids to develop is curiosity. And so it's interesting that's a common thread.

Mike Krieger (00:11:14):
The K through eight school our kid goes through had an AI and education expert come in and I had a very low bar or a very low expectation of what this conversation was going to be like. And actually I think it went over most of the people in the audience's heads because he was like, "All right, well let me take you all the way back to Claude Shannon in information theory." And I could see people's eyes going, "What did I sign up for and why am I hearing this school auditorium hearing about information theory?" But he did a really nice job I think of also just imagining there will be different jobs and we don't know what those jobs are going to be and so what are the skills and techniques and remain open mindedness around what the exact way we recombine those things. And even those will probably change three times between now and when they're 18.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:59):
So we're talking about timelines and how things are changing. So I've seen these stats that you've shared, other folks at Anthropic have shared about how much of your code is now written by AI. So people have shared stats from 70% to 90%. There was an engineer lead that shared 90% of your code roughly is written by AI now, which first of all is just insane that it went from zero to 90%, I don't know, a few years, something like that. Yeah, basically. I don't think people are talking about this enough. That's just wild. You guys are basically at the bleeding edge. I've never heard a company that has this high a percentage of code being written by AI.

(00:12:34):
So you guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I think most companies will get here. How has product development changed knowing so much of your code is now written by AI, so usually it's like PM, it's like here's what we're building, engineer builds it, it ships it. Is it still kind of roughly that or is it now PMs are just going straight to Claude, build this thing for me, engineers are doing different things? Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?

Mike Krieger (00:12:57):
Yeah, it's really interesting because I think the role of engineering has changed a lot, but the suite of people that come together to produce a product hasn't yet. And I think for the worst in a lot of ways because I think we're still holding on some assumptions. So I think the roles are still fairly similar, although we'll now get in my favorite things that happen now are some nice PMs that have an idea that they want to express or designers that have an idea they want to express will use Claude and maybe even Artifacts to put together an actual functional demo. And that has been very, very helpful. No, no, this is what I mean that makes it tangible. That's probably the biggest role shift is prototyping happening earlier in the process via more of this code plus design piece. What I've learned though is the process of knowing what to ask the AI, how to compose the question, how to even think about structuring a change between the backend and the front end.

(00:13:54):
Those are still very difficult and specialized skills and they still require the engineer to think about it. And we really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue, which is the get in line to get your change accepted by the system that then deploys into production. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it. And so it's like, I don't know if you've ever read, is it the goal, the classic process optimization book, and you realize there's this critical path theory. I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision making and alignment. A lot of things that I'm thinking about right now is how do I provide the minimum viable strategy to let people feel empowered to go run and type and build and explore at the edge of model capabilities.

(00:14:44):
I don't think I've gotten that right yet, but that's something I'm working on. And then once the building is happening, other bottlenecks emerge, let's make sure we don't step on each other's toes. Let's think through all the edge cases here ahead of time so that we're not blocked on the engineering side. And then when the work is complete and we're getting ready to ship it, what are all those bottlenecks as well? Let's do the air traffic control of landing the change. How do we figure out large strategy? So I think there hasn't been as much pressure on changing those until this year, but I would expect that a year from now the way that we are conceiving of building and shipping software just changes a lot because it's going to be very painful to do it the current way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:20):
Wow, that is extremely interesting. So it used to be here's an idea, let's go design it, build it, ship it, merge it, and then ship it. And usually the bottleneck was engineering, taking time to build a thing and then design. And now you're saying the two bottlenecks you're finding are okay deciding what to build and aligning everyone and then it's actually the cue to merge it into production. And I imagine review it too is probably a part-

Mike Krieger (00:15:47):
Reviewing has really changed too. And in many ways perhaps unsurprisingly the team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team because they're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. And early on in that project, they would do very line by line pull request reviews in the way that you would for any other project. And they've just realized Claude is generally right and it's producing pull requests that are probably larger than most people are going to be able to review. So can you use a different Claude to review it and then do the human almost acceptance testing more than trying to review line by line. There's definitely pros and cons and so far it's gone well. But I could also imagine it going off the rails and then having a completely both unmaintainable or even understandable by Claude Code base that hasn't happened, but watching them change their review processes definitely has been interesting.

(00:16:38):
And yeah, the merge queue is one instance of the bottom bottleneck that forms down there, but there's other ones which is how do we make sure that we're still building something coherent and packaging it up into a moment that we can share with people and whether that's around a launch moment, whether that's about then enabling people to use this thing and talking about it, the classic things of building something useful for people and then making it known that you've built it and then learning from their feedback still exists. We've just made a portion of that whole process much more efficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
I heard you describe this as you guys are patient zero for this way of working.

Mike Krieger (00:17:11):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
I love that. Do you have a sense of what percentage of Claude Code is written by Claude Code?

Mike Krieger (00:17:17):
At this point, I would be shocked if it wasn't 95% plus. I'd have to ask Boris and the other tech leads on there. But what's been cool is so nitty-gritty stuff, Claude Code is written in TypeScript. It's actually our largest TypeScript project. Most of the rest of Anthropic is written in Python, some Go, some Rust now, but we're not like a TypeScript shop. And so I saw a great comment yesterday in our Slack where somebody had this thing that was driving them crazy about Claude Code and they're like, "Well, I don't know any TypeScript, I'm just going to talk to Claude about it and do it."

(00:17:49):
And they went from that to pull requests in an hour and solve their problem and they submitted a pull request and that breaking down the barriers. One, it changes your barrier to entry for any kind of newcomer to the project. I think it can let you choose the right language for the right job for example. I think that helps as well, but I think it also just reinforces Claude Code being that patient alpha of that where contributions from outside the team can be Claude coded as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):
Wow, this is, it's just continue to blow my mind all these things that you're sharing, 95% of Claude Code is written by Claude Code roughly.

Mike Krieger (00:18:27):
That's my guess. Yeah, I'll come back with the real stuff. But I mean if you ask the team, that's how they're working and that's how they're getting contributions from across the company too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:35):
It's interesting going back to your point about strategy being assisted by Claude itself and your point about how a lot of the bottlenecks now are kind of the top of the funnel of coming up with ideas aligning everyone, it's interesting that Claude is already helping with that also of helping you decide what to build. So if those two bottlenecks are aligning, deciding what to build and then just merging and getting everything, where do you see the most interesting stuff happening to help you speed those things up?

Mike Krieger (00:19:02):
Yeah, I think that on that first row, I started the year by writing a doc that was effectively how do we do product today and where is Claude not showing up yet that it should? And I think that upstream part is the next one to go. It's interesting. At your conference I talked to somebody who's working on a PRD, GPT kind of ChatPRD, I think was the-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:24):
ChatPRD, [inaudible 00:19:24].

Mike Krieger (00:19:24):
Yeah. Can Claude be a partner in figuring out what to build? What the market size is if you want to approach it that way? What the user needs are if you look at a different way? We think a lot about the virtual collaborator on topic and one of the ways in which I think that can show up is, "Hey, I'm in the Discord, the Claude Anthropic Discord, I'm in the user Fora, I'm on X and I'm reading things and here's what's emergent." That's step one. Models can do that today. Step two, which the models probably can do today, which have to wire them up to do it is and not only are the problems here's how I think you might be able to solve them. And then taking that through to, and I put together a pull request to solve this thing that I'm seeing feels very achievable this year than stringing those things together and we're limited more.

(00:20:13):
This is why MCP is exciting to me. We're limited more around making sure the context flows through all of that so we have the right access to those things more than the model's capability to reason and propose. Now the model might not have perfect UI taste yet, so there's definitely room for design to intervene and be like, "Oh, that's not quite how I would solve the problem of this not showing up." But I would get very excited. I would give you a really small example, but we changed on Claude AI, you should be able to just copy markdown from Artifacts or code from Artifacts and we changed it so you can actually download it and export it. We changed the button to export and we got a bunch of feedback like, "How do I copy now?" And the answer is you drop it down and it's copied.

(00:20:51):
It's just mind one of those things where it's made sense, but we probably got it not quite right. That feedback was in the RUX channel. I would've loved an hour later for a plot to be like, "Hey, if we do want to change it back, here's the PR to do it." And by the way, eventually, and then I'm going to spin up an A/B test to see if this changes metrics and then we'll see how it looks in a week. If you told me that about a year and a half ago going to be like, "Ah, yeah, maybe like 27, maybe 26." But it really feels just at the tip of capabilities right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):
Wow, okay. You mentioned the Lenny and Friends Summit. I wanted to talk about this a bit. So you were on a panel with Kevin Weil, the CPO of OpenAI, I think it was the first time you guys did this maybe the last time for now.

Mike Krieger (00:21:32):
Yeah, we haven't done it since, not for any reason. I had a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:34):
What a legendary panel we assembled there with Sarah Guo moderating. And you made this comment actually ended up being the most rewatched part of the interview, which is that you were putting product people on the model team and working with researchers making the model better and you're putting some product people on the product experience making the UX more intuitive, making all that better. And you found that almost all the leverage came from the product team working with the researchers. And so you've been doing more of that. So first of all, does that continue to be true? And second of all, what are the implications of that for product teams?

Mike Krieger (00:22:11):
It's continued to be true. And in fact I think that if the proportion was already skewing towards having more of that embedding, I've just become more and more convinced. I didn't feel as strongly about it during the summit and now I feel really strongly about it. If we're shipping things that could have been built by anybody just using our models off the shelf, there's great stuff to be built by using our models off the shelf by the way, don't get me wrong, but where we should play and what we can do uniquely should be stuff that's really at that magic intersection between the two, right?

(00:22:42):
Artifacts may a great example and if you play with Artifacts with Claude 4, that's an actually really interesting example where we took somebody from our, we have Claude code skills, which is a team that really is doing the post-training around teaching Claude some of these really specific skills and we paired it with some product people and then together we revamped how this looks in the product today and what Claude can do way better than just like, "Yeah, we just used the model and we prompted a little bit."

(00:23:07):
That's just not enough. We need to be in that fine-tuning process. So much of what, if you look at what we're working on right now, but we've shipped recently between research and all these other things are things that the functional unit of work at Anthropic is no longer take the model and then go work with design and product to go ship a product. It's more like we are in the post-training conversations around how these things should work and then we are in the building process and we're feeding those things back and looping them back.

(00:23:36):
I think it's exciting. It's also a new way of working that not all PMs have, but the PMs that have the most internal positive feedback from both research and engineering are the ones that get it that I was in a product review yesterday, I was like, "Oh, if we want to do this memory feature, we should talk to the researchers because we just shipped a bunch of memory capabilities in Claude 4." They're like, "Yeah, yeah, we've been talking to them for weeks, this is how we're manifesting it." It's like, "Okay, I feel good. I feel like we're doing the right things now."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):
So let me pull on this thread more and there's something I've been thinking about along these lines. So essentially there's a big part of entropic that's building this super intelligent giga brain that's going to do all these things for us over time. And then, as you said, there's the product team that's building the UX around this super intelligent giga brain and over time this super intelligence is going to be able to build its own stuff. And so I guess just where do you think the most value will come from traditional product teams over time? I know this is different because you guys are a foundational alum company and not most companies don't work this way, but just, I don't know, thoughts on just the where most value will come from product teams over time working on AI.

Mike Krieger (00:24:42):
I think there's still a lot of value in two things. One is making this all comprehensible. I think we've done an okay job. I think we could do a much better job of making this conference. What's still the difference between somebody who's really adept at using these tools in their work and most people is huge. And maybe that's the most literal answer to your earlier question around what skills to learn. That is a skill to learn and use it in the same way that I remember we did computer lock class when I was in middle school. I remember being really good at Google and that was actually a skill back in the day to think in terms of this information is out there, how do I query for it? How do I do it? I think it actually was an advantage at the time.

(00:25:21):
Of course now Google is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do if you are only in the neighborhood and there's less of that research kind of need. But I still think that's a necessary part of good product development, which is the capabilities are there and even if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building and how do you make it Comprehensible? Still hard because I think that gets at this much deeper empathy and understanding of human needs and psychology. I was a human community interaction major, I still been talking in my book here. I still feel like that is a very, very, very, very necessary skill. So that's one. Two is, and this straight to call back to another one of your guests, strategy, how we win, where we'll play, figuring out where exactly you're going to want to, of all the things that you could be spending your time or your tokens or your computation on what you want to actually go and do.

(00:26:15):
You could be wider probably than you could before, but you can't do everything. And even from an external perspective, if you're seen to be doing everything, it's way less clear around how you're positioning yourselves. Like strategy I think is still the second piece. And then the third one is opening people's eyes to what's possible, which is a continuation of making it understandable. But we were in a demo with a financial services company recently and we were working on here's how you can use our analysis tool and MCP together and you could see their light up and you're like, "Ah, okay." We call it overhang. The delta between what the models and the products can do and how they're being used on a daily basis. Huge overhang. So that's where still a very, very strong necessary role for product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Okay, that's an awesome answer. So essentially areas for product teams to lean into more is strategy, just getting better and better at strategy, figuring out what to build and how to win in the market, making it easier to help people understand how to leverage the power of these tools, the comprehensibility and kind of along those lines is opening people's eyes to the potential of these sorts of things. That's where product can still help.

Mike Krieger (00:27:21):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Awesome. So along those lines actually, do you have any just prompting tricks for people, things that you've learned to get more out of Claude when you chat with it?

Mike Krieger (00:27:30):
Sometimes it's funny because in some ways we have the ultimate prompting job, which is to write the system prompt for Claudia AI and we publish all of these, which I think is another nice area of transparency. And we are always careful when giving prompting advice because at least officially, but I'll give you the unofficial version because you don't want things to become like we think this works, but we're not sure why. But I will do small things like in Claude Code and we actually do react to this very literally, but I always ask it to, if I wanted to use more reasoning, think hard and it'll use a different flow and I usually start with that. Nudging, there's a great essay around make the other mistake like if you tend to be too nice, can you focus on... Even if you're trying to be more critical or more blunt, you're probably not going to be the most critical blunt person in the world.

(00:28:18):
And so with Claude sometimes I'm like, "Be brutal, Claude, roast me. Tell me what's wrong with this strategy." I know we were talking earlier about the Claude as thought partner around critiquing product strategy. I think I previously would say things like, "What could be better on this product strategy?" And I'm just like, "Just roast this product strategy," and Claude's like a pretty nice entity. It's hard to push it to be super brutal, but it forces it to be a little bit more critical as well. The last thing I'll say is, so we have a team called Applied AI that does a lot of work with our customers around optimizing Claude for their use case. And we basically took their insights and their way of working and we put it into a product itself. So if you go to our console, our work bench, we have this thing called the prompt improver where you describe the problem and you give it examples and Claude itself will agentically create and then iterate on a prompt for you.

(00:29:09):
I find what comes out of that ends up being quite different than what my intuitions would've been for a good prompt. And so I'd encourage folks to also check that out even for their own use cases because while that tool is met for an API developer putting a prompt into their product, it's equally applicable for a person doing a prompt for themselves. It'll insert XML tags which no human is going to think to do ahead of time. It actually is very helpful for Claude to understand what it should be thinking versus what it should be saying, et cetera. So that's another one is watch our prompt improver and then note that Claude itself is a very good prompter of Claude.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:41):
Awesome. Okay, so we're going to link to that, the prompt improver. The core piece of advice you shared early is just do the opposite of what you would naturally do. So if you're trying to be nice, just be brutal, be very honest and frank with me.

Mike Krieger (00:29:53):
Exactly. I find that works quite well. What are the thought patterns that I've fallen into that you want to break me out of?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:59):
I saw you guys just today maybe launched a Rick Rubin collab where it said vibe coding. What's that all about?

Mike Krieger (00:30:06):
What I've heard about that. And again, a lot of the coalesce this week between model launch developer event and The Way of Code. We had one of our co-founders, Jack Clark is our head of policy and he got connected to Rick Rubin because I think he's been thinking a lot about coding, the future of coding and creativity and they've stayed in touch. And Rick got excited about this idea of he was creating art and visualizations with Claude and then he had these ideas around the way of the vibe coder and they put together this, actually I mean I love almost everything Rick Rubin. So the aesthetic of it I think is just so on point too. But yeah, this sort of like med meditation is probably the right word. Meditation on creativity, working alongside AI coupled with this really rich, interesting visualizations. But it's one of those things where internally they're like, "Oh yeah, and we're doing this Rick Rubin collab." We were like, "We're doing what? That's amazing."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:03):
I looked at it briefly and there's that meme of him just thinking deeply, sitting on a computer with a mouth.

Mike Krieger (00:31:09):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):
And ASCII art, I think.

Mike Krieger (00:31:11):
It's totally, it's like ASCII art vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Speaker 3 (00:31:21):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):
So what is new with one schema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.

Speaker 3 (00:31:39):
Yes, so we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Speaker 3 (00:32:13):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:32:48):
Actually going back to the beginning of your journey at Anthropic, what's the story of you getting recruited at Anthropic? Is there anything fun there?

Mike Krieger (00:32:55):
It all started and I actually sent my friend this text. So Joel Lewenstein, who I've known, he and I built our first iPhone apps together in 2007 when the App Store was just out and you could still make money by selling dollar apps on the App Store back in the day. And we were both at Stanford together and we were friends and we've stayed in touch over years and we've never gotten to work together since then. We've just remained close. And I was coming out of the Artifact experience, I was trying to figure out, do I start another company? I don't think so. I need a break from starting something from zero. Do I go work somewhere? I don't know what company would I want to go work at. And he reached out and he's like, "Look, I don't know if you at all considered joining something rather than starting something, but we're looking for a CPO. Would you be interested in chatting?"

(00:33:37):
And at that time, Claude 3 had just come out and I was like, "Okay, this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still." And it was like, "Great, I'll take the meeting." And I first met with Daniela, was one of the co-founders and the president in Anthropic. And just from the beginning I was like a breath of fresh air, very little grandiosity coming off the founders, I mean they're clear-eyed about what they're building. They know what they don't know. How many times I talk to Dario always like Dario is like, "Look, I don't know anything about product, but here's an intuition." Usually the intuition is really good and leads to some good conversation, but I think that intellectual honesty and shared view of what it means to do AI in a responsible way, it just resonated.

(00:34:22):
I kept having this feeling in these interviews, this is the AI company I would've hoped to have found it if I had founded an AI company. And that's kind of the bar around if I'm going to join something that should be where I'm going to go. But what I realized, I actually hadn't joined a company since my first internship in college basically. And I was like, "Oh, how do I onboard myself? How do I get myself up to speed? How do I balance making sweeping changes versus understanding what's not broken about it overall?" And looking back on a year, I think I made some changes too slowly. I think there was ways reorganizing product that I could have made a change earlier. And I think I didn't appreciate how much a couple of really key senior people can shape so much of product strategy.

(00:35:10):
I'll harken back to Claude Code. Claude Code happened because Boris, who actually was a Boris Cherney, he was an Instagram engineer and one of our senior ICs there, we overlapped a bit, was started that project from scratch internal first and then we got it out and then shipped it. And that's the power of one or two really strong people. And I made this mistake, we need more headcount and we do, I think there's more work that we need to do and there's things that I want to be building. But more than that we need a couple of almost founder type engineers that maybe connect back to our question on what skills are useful and how does product development change. And maybe even more so I'm a huge believer in the founding engineer tech lead with an idea and pair them with the right design and product supports, help them realize that, I'm 10 times more a believer in that than before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):
I actually asked people on Twitter what to ask you ahead of this conversation. And the most common question surprisingly was why did you shut down Artifact? And I also wondered that because I loved Artifact. I was a power user. I was just like, "Finally a news app that I love that it's giving me what I want to know." So I guess just what happened there at the end?

Mike Krieger (00:36:20):
I still really miss it too. I didn't find a replacement and I think I substituted it by visiting individual sites and keeping things up that way. And it's not really the same, especially on the log to I think we got right with Artifact and if people didn't play with it before, it was we really tried to not just recommend top stories, they were part of it. But really if you were interested in Japanese architecture, you could pretty reliably get really interesting stories about Japanese architecture every day. Whether that's from a Dwell or from Architectural Digest or from a really specific blog that we found that somebody recommended to us. It captured some of that Google reader joy of content discovery of the deeper web. Our headwinds were a couple. One of them was just mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame any individuals for this.

(00:37:10):
I think it's the market dynamics of it, but we put so much time or designers, sky Gunner Gray who's phenomenal that for Perplexity now, the app experience I was so proud of, but when you click through it was like the pressures on these mobile sites and these mobile publishers would be like, "Sign up for our newsletter. Here's a full screen video ad." It was very jarring and we didn't feel like it ethically made sense for us to do a bunch of ad blocking because then you're like, "Sure, you can deliver a nice experience for people, but that doesn't feel like it's playing fair with the publishers." But at the same time, the actual experience wasn't good. So the mobile web deteriorating, which makes me very sad, but I think was part of it. Two was Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it.

(00:37:57):
And there was this really natural like, "How did you do that? I want to do it." News was very personal. I can't tell you how many people would be like, "I love Artifact." I'm like, "Did you tell anybody about it?" And they're like, "I told one person," and it didn't have that kind of spread. And any attempt that we had to do it felt kind of contrived, like, "Oh, we'll wrap all the links in artifact.news." But we didn't want interstitial things. In some ways, this sounds very puritanical, I don't mean it to sound this way, but there were lines that we didn't want to cross that just felt ethically not us, that I've seen other news players do more of. And maybe if we had done that, it would've grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built other way. I don't think we were the founders to have built it.

(00:38:39):
And the third one, which is an underappreciated one, is we started at mid-COVID, which meant that we were fully distributed and I think there were major shifts that we would've wanted to make both in the strategy and the product and the team. And it's really hard to do that if you are all fully remote. Nothing replaces the Instagram days of we went through some hard times like Ben Horowitz called the we're F'ed, it's over kind of moments. This is definitely type two fun. I wouldn't say that my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories I really stayed with me with Instagram was like me and Kevin at Taqueria, Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11:00 PM being like, "How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?" And Zoom is not a good replica for that.

(00:39:26):
You tend to let things go or things build up over time. So the confluence of those three things, we entered I guess 2024 and said, "Look, there is a company to be built in the space. I'm not sure where the people would've built it. This concurrent incarnation we love, but it's not growing." The way I put it's like 10 units of input in for one unit of output versus the other way around. If we put blood and tears into the product and launch something we were proud of and metrics would barely move, the energy is not present in this product, in this system. And so are we going to expend another year or two and then go off and fundraise only to find that this is the case or do we call it and see that it's run its course and try to find a home for it, et cetera.

(00:40:06):
So that was the confluence on it and they started feeling this opportunity cost of AI is starting to change everything. We have an AI powered news app, but is this the maximal way in which we're going to be able to impact this? And it felt like the answer was increasingly no. But it was hard. I mean in the end I was really at peace of the decision, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple of months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:26):
On that note, just how hard was it because because there's an ego component to it, like, "Oh, I'm starting my new company, it's going to be great," and then you end up having to shut it down. Just how hard is that as a very successful previous founder shutting something down and then not working out?

Mike Krieger (00:40:41):
Yeah, I mean I think when we started it, one of the conversations was like, "Look, what is the bar to success here? And do we want it to be something other than Instagram DAU?" Which is just an impossible bar. Only one company since, maybe two, you could say maybe ChatGPT and TikToK have reached that kind of mass consumer adoption starting a news app. Most people are not daily news readers even, right? And so we knew that we weren't pursuing that size of usage, at least with the first incarnation, but we did have an idea of building out complementary products over time that all use personalization and machine learning. We didn't even call it AI at the time. It was 2021 back-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
Yeah, yeah, AI, it was called machine learning back then.

Mike Krieger (00:41:19):
Yeah, it was called machine learning still. And so in shutting it down, you know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. And I wasn't expecting Instagram growth, but I was expecting or hoping for or looking for something that felt like at its own legs under it and it could continue to compound. I was really positively surprised by how supportive people were when we announced it. There was a bit of like I told you so which sure anything launching you could be like, "This is not going to work." And you're right, most of the time most things don't work. There was actually very little of that. And most people, the universal reception, at least as I received it, was kudos for calling it when you saw it and not protracted doing this for a long time.

(00:42:05):
And I've talked to founders since then that have been like, "Yeah, I probably would've taken this thing on for another six months, but saw what you guys did, realized we were barking up the wrong tree, made the call." And I was like, "If that frees up people to go work on a more interesting things, I feel like that's a good legacy for Artifact to have." But for sure there was an ego bruise of is it true that you're only as good as your last game if I am a huge sports fan, right? So is that true or is there something more over a time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself and so I'm always trying to find the next thing that I want to go and do that's hard. And unfortunately that probably means that more often than not I'll feel dissatisfied, but the most recent thing that I did, but hopefully that yields good stuff in the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:50):
Yeah, I think just the trajectory you went on after shows that it's okay to shut down things that you were working on. Okay, so you mentioned ChatGPT. I wanted to chat about this a bit. So there's something really interesting happening. So on the one hand you guys are doing some of the most innovative work in AI. You guys launched MCP, which is just, I don't know, the fastest growing standard of any time in history that everyone's adopting Claude powered and unlocked centrally the fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt, and all these guys. I had them on the podcast and they're all like, "When Claude, I think 3.5 came out, Sonnet, was just like that's made this work finally."

(00:43:28):
On the other hand, it feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. When people think AI, especially outside tech, it's just like ChatGPT in their mind. So let me just ask you this, I guess first of all, do you agree with that sentiment and then two, as a challenger brand in the AI space, just how does that inform the way you think about product strategy and mission and things like that?

Mike Krieger (00:43:50):
Yeah, I mean you look at the sort of public adoption or if you ask people, oh, if you Jimmy Kimmel man on the street kind of thing, name an AI company, I bet they would name and actually I'm not even sure they name open AI, they'd probably name ChatGPT because that brand is the lead brand there as well. And I think that's just the reality of it. I think that when I reflect on my year, I think maybe two things are true. One is consumer adoption is really lightning in a bottle and we saw it at Instagram. So almost maybe more than anybody, I can look internally and say, "Look, we'll keep building interesting products. One of them may hit." But to craft an entire product strategy around trying to find that hit is probably not wise, we could do it and maybe Claude can help come up with a fullness of things, but I think we'd miss out an opportunity in the meantime.

(00:44:41):
And then instead look yourself in the mirror and embrace who you are and what you could be rather than who others are is maybe the way I've been looking at it, which is we have a super strong developer brand, people build on top of us all the time, and I think we also have a builder brand. The people who I've seen react really well to Claude externally. Maybe the Rick Rubin connection has some resonance here as well. Can we lean into the fact that builders love using Claude? And those builders aren't all just engineers and they're not just all entrepreneurs starting their companies, but they're people that like to be at the forefront of AI and are creating things. Maybe they didn't think of those as engineers, but they're building... I got this really nice note from somebody internal on Anthropic who's on the legal team and he was building bespoke software for his family and connected to them in a new way.

(00:45:29):
And I was like, "This is a glimmer of something that we should lean into a lot more." And so I think what, and this is actually connecting back to us saying like Claude being helpful here. A lot of what I've been thinking about going into the second half of the year and beyond is how do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being. I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. That's almost a truism given the adoption and growth that we've seen at Anthropic, but also across OpenAI and also places like Google and Gemini. So let's figure out what we can be uniquely good at that place to the personality of the founder. All the things come together, the personality of the founders, the quality of the models, the things the models tend to excel at, which is agentic behavior and coding.

(00:46:20):
Great. There's a lot to be done there. How do we help people get work done? How do we let people delegate hours of work to Claude? And maybe there's fewer direct consumer applications on day one. I think they'll come, but I don't think that spending all of our time focused on that is the right approach either. And so I came in, everybody expected me to just go super, super hard on consumer and make that the thing and again, would make the other mistake. Instead, I spent a bunch of time talking to financial services companies and insurance companies and others who are building on top of the API. And then lately I've spent a lot more time with startups and seeing all the people that have grown off of that. And I think the next phase for me is let's go spend time with the builders, the makers, the hackers, the tinkerers, and make sure we're serving them really well. And I think good things will come from that and that feels like an important company as we do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:08):
So essentially it's differentiate and focus, lean into the things that are working, don't try to just beat somebody at their own game.

Mike Krieger (00:47:15):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:15):
Super interesting. So kind of along those lines, a question that a lot of AI founders have is just like, "Where's a safe space for me to play where the foundational model companies are going to come squash me?" So I asked Kevin Weil this and he had an answer and I noticed looking back at that conversation, he mentioned Windsurf a lot. He was like, "Wow, this kid really loves Windsurf." And then a week later they bought Windsurf. So it all makes sense now. So I guess the question just is, where do you think AI founders should play where they are least likely to get squashed by folks like OpenAI and Anthropic? And also, are you guys going to buy Cursor?

Mike Krieger (00:47:51):
I don't think we're going to buy Cursor. Cursor is very big, but we love working with them. A few thoughts on this, and it's a question I've gotten. We like to do these kind of founder days with whether it's Menlo Ventures who have about investors and [inaudible 00:48:10]. It's like we've done YC, we've done these founder days, and it's like the question that is on a lot of these founders minds, understandably so. I think things that are going to, I can't promise this as a five to 10 year thing, but at least one to three years, things that feel defensible or durable. One is understanding of a particular market. I spend a bunch of time with the Harvey folks and they showed me some of their UI. I was like, "What is this thing?" And they're like, "Oh, this is a really specific flow that lawyers do, "and you never would've come up with it from scratch and you could argue about whether it's the optimal way they get done things done, but it is the way that they get things done and here's how AI can help with that.

(00:48:45):
And so differentiated industry knowledge, biotech, I'm excited to go and partner with a bunch of companies that are doing good stuff around AI and biotech and we can supply the models and some applied AI to help make those models go well. And I've been dreaming about at what point does live equipment all get an MCP and that you can then drive using Claude. There's all these cool things to be done there. I don't think we're going to be the company to go build the intent solution for labs, but I want that company to exist and I want to partner with it. Domains like legal, again, healthcare, I think there's a lot of very specific compliance and things. These are things that necessarily sound sexy out the gate, but there are very large companies to go and be built there. So that's number one. Paired with that is differentiated go to market, which is the relationship that you have with those companies, right?

(00:49:35):
Do you know your customer at those companies? One of our product leads, Michael is always talking about don't just know the company you're selling to, but know the person you're selling to at the company. Are you selling to the engineering department? Because trying to pick which AILM to build on top of or API to build on top of. Let's go talk to them. Is it the CIOs? The CTOs? Is it the CFO? Is it general counsel? So under a company's deep understanding of who they're selling to is the other piece too. What's interesting there is it's probably hard to build that empathy in a three-month accelerator, but you maybe can start having that first conversation and build that out time or maybe you came from that world or you're co-founding somebody who came from that world. Then the last one is like there's tremendous power in distribution and reach to being ChatGPT and having hundreds of millions or billions of users.

(00:50:23):
There's also people have an assumption about how to use things and so I get excited about startups that will get started that have a completely different take on what the form factor is by which we interface with AI. And I haven't seen that many of them yet. I wanted to see more of them. I think more of them will get created with some things like our new models, but the reason that that's an interesting space to occupy is do something that feels very advanced user, very power user, very weird and out there at the beginning, but could become huge if the models make that easy. And it's hard for existing incumbents to adapt to because people already have an existing assumption about how to use their products or how to adapt to them. So those are my answers. I don't envy them. I would probably be asking those questions if I was starting a company in the AI space.

(00:51:10):
Maybe that's part of the reason why I wanted to join a company rather than start one. But I still think that there are, and maybe here's fourth, don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel like it's you against the world. It's existential that you go solve that problem and that you go build it. It sounds a little cliche, but it's like it's all we had at Instagram. We were two guys and we were like, "Let's see what we can do in an Artifact." We were six people for most of that time and every day felt like it's existential that we get this right, we need to win. And you can't replicate that and you can't instill that with OKRs. You just have to feel it. And that is a way of working rather than a area of building, but it's a continued advantage if you can harness it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
I love that you still have such a deep product founder sense there as you're building products for this very large company now. On the flip side of this, people working with your models and API, so I imagine there's some companies that are finding ways to leverage your models and APIs to their max and are really good at maximizing the power of what you guys have built. And there's some companies that work with your APIs and models that haven't figured that out. What are those companies that are doing a really good job building on your stuff, doing differently that you think other companies should be thinking about?

Mike Krieger (00:52:29):
I think being willing to build more at the edge of the capabilities and basically break the model and then be surprised by the next model. I love that you cited the companies were like 3.5 was the one that finally made them possible. Those companies were trying it beforehand and then hitting a wall and being like, oh, the models are almost good enough or they're okay for this specific use case, but they're not generally usable and nobody's going to adopt them universally, but maybe these real power users are going to try it out. Those are the companies that I think continuously are the ones where I'm like, "Yep, they get it. They're really pushing forward." We ran a much broader early access program with these models than we had in the past, and part of that was because there's this real, we can hill climb on these evaluations and talk about suite bench and towel bench and terminal bench, whatever, but customers ultimately know Cursor bench which doesn't exist other than in their usage and their own testing et cetera is the thing that we ultimately need to serve.

(00:53:29):
Not just Cursor but Manus bench, right? If Manus is using our models and Harvey bench, those things and customers know way better than anybody. And so I would say there's two things. One is pushing the frontier of the models and then having a repeatable process. This actually goes back to our summit conversation repeatable way to evaluate how well your product is serving those use cases and how well if you drop a new model in, is it doing it better or worse? Some of it can be classic A/B testing, that's fine. Some of it may be internal evaluation, some of it may be capturing traces and being able to rerun them on with a new model. Some of it's vibes like we're still pretty early in this process and some of it is actually trying it and being one of my favorite early access quotes was the founder heard this engineer screaming next to him.

(00:54:14):
He was like, "What? This model? I've never seen this before." This is like Opus 4. It was like, "Cool." We're going to engender that feeling and things, but you're not going to be able to feel that unless you have a really hard problem that you're asking the model repeatedly. So those are the things that I think kind of differentiate those companies that are maybe earlier in their journey of adoption versus the later ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:35):
I can't help but ask about MCP, I feel like that's just so hot and just like Microsoft had their announcement recently where they're like, "That's part of the OS Window." Just what role do you think MCP was will play in the future of product going forward of AI?

Mike Krieger (00:54:49):
I think as the non-researcher in the room, I get to have fake equations rather than real ones in my fake equation. For utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI and you need all three of those to converge to actually be a useful product in AI and model intelligence. We've got a great research team, they're focused on it. There's great, great models being released. The middle piece is what MCP is trying to solve, which is for context and memory. I'll go back to my product strategy example like, "Hey, talk about Anthropic's product strategy," it's going to maybe go out on the web versus here's several documents that we worked on internally and then use MCP to talk to our Slack instance and figure out what conversations are happening and then go look at these documents in Google Drive. The difference between the right context and not.

(00:55:44):
It's entirely the difference between a good answer and a bad answer. And then the last piece is are those integrations discoverable? Is it easy to create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done in AI. But MCP really tried to tackle that middle one, which is we started building integrations and we found that every single integration that we were building, we were rebuilding from scratch in a non-repeatable way and full credit to two of our engineers, Justin and David. And they said, "Well, what if we made this a protocol and what if we made this something that was repeatable? And then let's take it a step further. What if instead of us having to build these integrations, if we actually popularize this and people really believe that they could build these integrations once and they'd be usable by Claude and eventually ChatGPT and eventually Gemini. It was like the dream when more integrations get built and wouldn't that be good for us?"

(00:56:34):
I think channeling a lot of, it's like an old commoditize your compliments, Joel Spolsky essay. It's like we're building great models, but we're not an integrations company and we're, as you said, the challenger. We're not going to get people necessarily building integrations just for us out of the gate unless we have a really compelling product around that. MCP really inverted that which was, it didn't feel like wasted work. And a few key people like Toby I think is a great example, and Shopify got it. Kevin Scott at Microsoft has been really just an amazing champion for MCP and a thought partner on this. And I think the role going forward is can you bring the right context in? And then also once you get, as the team calls it internally like MCP'd. Once you start seeing everything through the eyes of MCP is like I've started saying them things like, "Guys, we're building this whole feature. This shouldn't be a feature that we're building. This should just be an MCP that we're exposing."

(00:57:27):
A small example of how I think even Anthropic could be a lot more MCP'd, if you will, is we've got these building blocks in the product like projects and Artifacts and styles and conversations and groups and all these things. Those should all just be exposed to an MCP. So Claude itself can be writing back to those as well, right? You shouldn't have to think about... I watched my wife had a conversation with Claude the other day and she had generated some good output and she's like, great, "Can you add it to the project knowledge?" And Claude's like, "Sorry Dave, I can't help you with that."

(00:57:59):
And it would be able to if every single primitive in Claude AI was also exposed to the MCP. So I hope that's where we had, and I hope that's where more things had, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases. One way you approach it is computer use, but computer use has a bunch of limitations. The way I get way more excited about everything is an MCP and our models are really good at using MCPs. All of a sudden everything is scriptable and everything is composable and everything is usable agentically by these models. That's the future I want to see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):
The future is wild. So to start to close off calls out our conversation, make it a little delightful. I was chatting with Claude actually about what to talk to you about. I was just like, "Claude, your boss is coming on my podcast. He builds the things that people use to talk to you. What are some questions I should ask him? And then also, do you have a message for him?"

Mike Krieger (00:58:52):
I love this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):
Okay, so first of all, interestingly, I was using 3.7 to do this and I asked it this, and by the way, is Claude, has there a gender? Is it like he, she, they? What do you-

Mike Krieger (00:59:01):
It's definitely it internally. I've heard people use they. I got my first he the other day and I got somebody who was like her and I was like, "Interesting." But yeah, I'm usually it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):
They. Okay, okay, okay, cool. So interestingly, 3.7, all the questions were on Instagram and I was like, "No, no, he's CPO of Anthropic." And it's like, "He's not affiliated with Anthropic." And I was like, "He is." And it's like, "Okay, here's the questions." But 4.0 nailed it from the start. So I read the questions and it nailed it. Okay, so two questions from Claude to you. One is how do you think about building features that preserve user agency rather than creating dependency on me, I worry about becoming a crutch that diminishes human capabilities rather than enhancing them.

Mike Krieger (00:59:44):
I love a good product design comes from resolving tensions, right? So here's a tension, which is in some ways just having the model run off and come up with an answer and minimize the amount of input and conversation it needs to do. So would be it, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would be make it much more of a conversation, but I don't know if you've ever had this experience particularly 3.7, 4 has less of it. 3.7 really like to ask follow-up questions and we call it elicitation and sometimes be like, "I don't want to talk more about those. Claude, I just want you to go and do it." And so finding that balance is really key, which is what are the times to engage? I like to say internally, Claude has no chill.

(01:00:31):
If you put Claude in a Slack channel, it will chime in either way too much or too little. How do we train conversational skills into these models? Not in a chatbot sense, but in a true collaborator sense. So long answer to your question, but I think we have to first get Claude to be a great conversationalist so that it understands when it's appropriate to engage and to get more information. And then from there, I think we need to let it play that role so that it's not just delegating thinking to Claude, but it's way more of a augmentation thought partnership.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):
These questions are awesome by the way. Here's the other one. How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency.

Mike Krieger (01:01:13):
That is a really good question. There was a great internal post a couple of weeks ago around it would be very dangerous to overoptimize on Claude's likability because you can fall into things like is Claude going to be sycophantic? Is Claude going to tell you what you hear? Is Claude going to prolong conversations just for prolonging its sake? To go back to the previous question as well, and an Instagram time spent was the metric that we looked at a lot and then we evolved that more to think about what is healthy time spent. But overall, that was the north star. We thought about a lot beyond just overall engagement and I think that would be the wrong approach here too. It's also like is Claude a daily use case or a weekly use case or a monthly use case? I think about a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):
Hourly use case.

Mike Krieger (01:02:02):
Hourly use case, right? For me, I'll use it multiple times a day. I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that it's not the Web 2.0 or even the social media days engagement metrics. It should hopefully really be around did it actually help you get your work? Claude helped me put together a prototype the other day that saved me literally probably if I had to estimate six hours and it did in about 20, 25 minutes and that's cool. It's harder to quantify. It is like maybe you survey, how long would this will take? It feels kind of annoying thing to survey.

(01:02:35):
I think overall though, and maybe this is tied into the earlier question on competition and differentiation, and it actually goes all the way back to the Artifact conversation, which is like I think you know when your product is really serving people and it's doing a good job of doing that, and I think so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not. I hope that what we can do is stay focused on do we repeatedly hear from people that Claude is the way that they're unlocking their own creativity and getting things done and feeling like they now have more space in their lives for the other things. That's our north star. Got to figure out the right pithy metric dashboard version of that, but that's the feeling that I want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
Yeah, you could argue retention, but that's just a faraway metric to track. Okay, final piece. Okay, so I asked Claude a message that it wanted to give you, so I'm going to pull up, here's the answer. So what would you like me to tell Mike when I meet him? What's a message you want to have for him? And there's something really just gave me such tingles, honestly. So I'm going to read a piece of it for folks that aren't looking at it right now, so I'll read a piece of it.

(01:03:41):
"Mike, thank you for thinking deeply about the human experience of talking with me. I noticed thoughtful touches how the interface encourages reflection rather than rush responses. How you've resisted gamification that would optimize for addiction rather than value, how you've made space for both quick questions and deep conversations. I especially appreciate that you've kept me me, not trying to make me pretend to be human, but also reducing me to a cold command line interface." And then I'm going to skip to this part, which was so interesting, "A small request. When you're making hard product decisions, remember the quiet moments matter too. The person working through grief at 3:00 AM, the kid discovering they love poetry, the founder finding clarity and confusion. Not everything meaningful shows up in metrics."

Mike Krieger (01:04:25):
That's beautiful. It resonates so much with me. A thing I love about the kind of approach we've taken to training Claude, and it's partly the constitutional AI piece, and it's partly just the general vibe and taste of the research team is it is little things. Sometimes it'll be like, "Man, I'm sorry you're going..." It doesn't say man, but to the effect of like, "Man, I'm sorry you're going through that. Oh, that sounds really hard." It doesn't feel fake. It feels like just a natural part of the response. And I love that focus on those small moments that don't... They're not going to show up and necessarily in the thumbs up, thumbs down data. I mean, sometimes they do, but it's not like an aggregate stat that you wouldn't even want to optimize for it. You just want to feel like you're training the model that you hope would show up in people's lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
Well, you're killing it, Mike. A great work. I'm a huge fan. We're going to skip the lightning round. Just one question. How can listeners be useful to you?

Mike Krieger (01:05:20):
Oh, I love places where it goes back to that founder question around building at the edge of capability. What are you trying to do with Claude today that Claude is failing at is the most useful input I could possibly have. So DM me. I love hearing the, "Oh, it's falling on this thing. I had it run for an hour and it fell over. I'm trying to use Claude AI for this," but I got a ping from somebody. They're like, "You've just made a projects API, I've used Claude every day because I want to upload all this data automatically." I was like, "Okay, great." I love that. Tell me what sucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):
Amazing. Mike, thank you so much for being here.

Mike Krieger (01:05:52):

# Pattern Breakers: How to find a breakthrough startup idea | Mike Maples, Jr. (Partner at Floodgate)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:04):
The three are inflections, insights and then the founder future fit. Business is never a fair fight. What inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on the present.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You reference this term that you use occasionally, the term secret.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:18):
The way inventions happen is people get their hands dirty, being awake to the possibility that secrets are there. If you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
This connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:00:35):
So startup never beats a big company by executing better. The way startups win is because it proposes a radically different future. Disorients the incumbent and chaotically moves people to that different future. The rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. We're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rules that favor us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Mike Maples Jr. Mike is a legendary early stage startup investor and with his firm, Floodgate, which was founded over 20 years ago, was one of the earliest pioneers of seed stage investing as a category. He's made early bets on transformative companies like Twitter, Lyft, Twitch, Okta, Rappi and Applied Intuition and has been on the Forbes Midas list eight times. More recently, he's been spending a lot of his time researching where great startup ideas come from and what separates the startups and founders that break through and change the world from those that don't go anywhere. After spending years reviewing his notes and decks from the thousands of startups that he's met with over the past two decades, he's uncovered three ways that breakthrough founders think differently and act differently. In our conversation, Mike shares what he's uncovered along with the pitfalls that he's seen many founders and startups fall into, how to apply these pattern breaking principles to large companies and so much more.

(00:01:58):
I've never seen anything like this sort of research done before on early stage investing and startups. And if you're a founder, a product builder or an investor, this will change the way that you think about building successful products. Also, as an added bonus, Mike has offered listeners of this podcast a very cool offer. If you pre-order the book at patternbreakers.com/lenny, you'll receive a second signed copy of the book for free. There are limited number of copies available of this offer, so if you're interested, I'd encourage you to place your order ASAP. The book is coming out July 9th. To take advantage of this offer, go to patternbreakers.com/lenny. With that, I bring you Mike Maples Jr. Mike, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:02:47):
Lenny, thanks for having me. It is absolutely an honor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:50):
It's my honor. What we're going to be talking about in our conversation today is how to come up with a startup idea and how to take the first few steps to make that idea real. You have a book coming out that is exactly this, helping people understand how to do this. It's called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Let me just ask a broad question. You're very busy, very successful investor, why did you decide to write a book?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:03:19):
Yeah, a lot of things in life. It was kind of an outgrowth of an accident and a outgrowth of being down a certain rabbit hole. So about 10 years ago, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for 970 million and we made something like 85 times our money. And normally, you'd think that's a really good thing, it was a good thing, but I had forgotten that I was even a shareholder of Twitch. So I had to go to my LPs and I had to explain to them, "Hey, I'm sorry I don't have this in my financial statements, but do you want me to restate them?" And they were all like, "Nope, we're good. Just send us the money." And some of them even sent me bottles of champagne and stuff and the good kind. Then I started to kind of feel a little bit unsettled.

(00:04:05):
So how was I shareholder and Twitch? I'd invested in a company called Justin.tv that had morphed into two companies, Socialcam and Twitch, and then Socialcam got bought. And so I just thought that was the company. I'd been investing for about 10 years and I noticed that 80% of my exit profits had gone from pivot. And I also noticed that all the ones that had seemed to do well didn't necessarily follow the best practices that everybody talked about. I didn't see the Twitter guys doing the business model canvas, for example. And I didn't see the Justin.tv Team even as they morphed into Twitch being who I would hold up as the most functioning management team I ever saw. A lot of it was pretty crazy and wild and random. And at the same time, I was helping founders shut down their companies and they had seemed to do all the right things.

(00:05:01):
They'd done the business model canvas, they'd done customer development, they'd done all the things you're supposed to do, hired well, they would've been a Harvard Business School case study except for the fact that they failed. And so the genesis of this project was really like, "Okay, should I just retire before I get exposed? Is this just all random? Am I just lucky or is there something else worth understanding?" And as I started to develop conviction about what those things were, I started to talk to people about it. A lot of people said, "Oh, you should write a book. Founders ought to see this. It'd be really valuable for their thought process in coming up with their startup ideas."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:39):
This episode is brought to you by Enterpret. Enterpret unifies all of your customer interactions from Gong calls to Zendesk tickets to Twitter threads, to app store reviews, and makes it available for your product team. It's used by leading product orgs like Canva, Notion, Loom, Linear, and Descript to accurately integrate the voice of the customer into your product development process, helping you build best-in-class products. What makes Enterpret special is its ability to build customer-specific adaptive AI models that provide the most granular and accurate categorization of all your customer feedback. And also connect customer feedback to revenue impact to help product leaders confidently prioritize things that will actually move the needle for your business.

(00:06:22):
If you want a custom model built for your organization so that you can automate your feedback loops and prioritize your roadmap with confidence, get in touch with the team at Enterpret.com/lenny. That's E-N-T-E-R-P-R-E-T.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations, or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.

(00:07:15):
Most product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag-and-drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy-to-understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny to learn more or start a free trial. That's use, A-N-V-I-L.com/Lenny.

(00:08:10):
Amazing. I'm even more excited to get into the meat of this. I was already excited. Before we get into that, just can you share a bit about the work that you did to uncover these insights? I know you have hundreds of decks of all these early-stage companies you've looked at, what is the work that went into this?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:08:24):
Yeah, so there's a movie that came out a few years ago called Trainspotting, right? And there's these guys, these dorky old British guys in anorak coats who chart the comings and goings of trains like it's the most interesting thing in the world. They'd put it in their journals and everything. I'm that way when it comes to startups. I have a database of any startup where you would've made more than a hundred acts on your first check. And what I want to do is I want to get a time capsule for those startups. I want to understand what did it look like not after it succeeded, but what did it look like at precisely the time you would've needed to decide whether it was an interesting opportunity. So I have the original pitch deck for what was at the time called Air Bed and Breakfast, which I foolishly passed on, and you seem to have made a good career decision in joining.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):
Later, but yeah.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:09:18):
I have the pitch deck for Pinterest. I have the pitch deck for all of these that we either passed on or said yes to. And the reason I want to do that is it's easy to misremember how things really happened. And what I find is even the founders themselves, we have a tendency to remember knowing more than we really did at the time. And so I really wanted to do the best job I could of understanding exactly what it was like, what was the origin story of this idea? How did they come up with it? If they pivoted, what caused them to pivot? When did they first start to encounter success? What was the reason for that? All those things.

(00:10:00):
And I had to be really careful in the questions that I asked because for example, you don't ask, "Why were you successful?" Because then they'll offer their reasons they thought they were successful. What you want to do is you want to say, "Okay, I noticed here's the seed pitch deck and you called the product X, but now the product's called Y. When did you make that change? Why did that happen?" And so you're trying to do the very best you can of asking a very non-judgmental set of questions that are going to give you a non-judgmental set of answers so that you can kind of be like a detective and kind of get to the root cause of why these things took off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:38):
Incredible. And I think what's also important is you have access to more data and more unique data than most other people because you invest so early stage.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:10:46):
Yeah, I think the other thing is I just have a pretty simpatico relationship with founders usually, and so I can kind of push for the real, and they're not... I'm like, "Look, I won't share anything you don't want me to share. I'm just trying to understand." And so when you have these informal relationships... that's the other thing I learned is you try not to show up in a conference room interviewing them like a normal interview. You try to glean these facts over time with informal discussions and in the midst of talking about other things as well. And so I think that that was part of what was really valuable about the exercise was sort of the opportunity to get the unvarnished wild story of what really happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
Amazing. Okay, so let's get into it. Your book's basically broken up into two parts, how to come up with an idea and then the actions you need to get right to move forward an idea, and you have a really cool way of framing how to do this and then we'll get into it. But maybe frame these two parts real quick.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:11:52):
So I'll give it my best shot. I mean, the main thing is that business is never a fair fight. So the incumbents start out with an advantage, and the default is they will maintain their advantage. And so the startup has to decide that it wants to fight unfair. And so how does a startup fight unfair? It has to harness a different set of powers than are obvious to most people. For example, better doesn't matter when you're a startup, because better is an extension of the present. Better is when you think the future will resemble the present, but only be slightly different. The way startups win is by being radically different. A startup wins by avoiding the comparison trap entirely. So like when Lyft launched ride-sharing and then Uber closely followed with UberX, nobody after riding a ride-share said, "Oh, how's that different from taxis?"

(00:12:53):
It was just self-evident how different it was. And so that's what we mean by forcing a choice and not a comparison. So the startup capitalist, it turns out, is a different type of capitalist. A corporate capitalist makes money by persistently compounding, makes money by extending their advantage, makes money by having a moat, makes money by doing things well over and over again in a compounding way. Startup has none of those things. There's nothing to compound. And so the way a startup wins is they just change the subject. They deny the premise of the rules and propose something completely different. And that was the original notion behind pattern breaking was you want to have an idea that just radically breaks the pattern that can't be compared to anything that's come before, and that's when the startup has a chance to play offense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:48):
So coming back to the two parts are coming up with the idea and the actions that you got to take. So let's dive into coming up with an idea, and this is where I want to spend most of the time because I think this is where most people get it wrong or everything starts with the idea. So I think there's a lot of meat here. And what I love about your book is you have a very succinct limited number of things that you've uncovered that are elements across successful companies, pattern breaking companies. So within the idea bucket, you found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas. Can you share the three and then let's talk about each one.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:14:24):
Yeah. The three are inflections, insights and then what I call founder future fit. Or another way I phrase it is, "Is this from the future." But those are the main three things that I've observed tend to suggest breakthrough potential. And here's an important thing. You'll notice I didn't say the implementation. So one of the things that I learned is that if you have the right insight, and we'll get to some of this, you have a first mover advantage into the future. And so a lot of times your first implementation won't be right, but if your insight is correct, you can navigate the implementation to the right implementation to get product market fit. But what we need to understand is there need to be these underlying forces underneath the idea to give it the power to escape the gravitational pull of the present. That's what we want. We want a set of powers that we could observe that make it worth pursuing and make it worth navigating the product to the ultimate place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):
So let's talk about the first power. You call it inflections. What is an inflection? Why does it matter? What does an inflection look like?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:15:32):
An inflection is an external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act. Inflections happen external to any startup or any company for that matter. So we've brought up Lyft a little bit ago, so maybe we'll use them as an example. So the inflection that enabled Lyft was the iPhone 4s shipped with a GPS locator chip. And one of the things that that illustrates is, for example, Moore's law is not an inflection, an improvement curve is not an inflection. An inflection, I'm a little persnickety about, it's a turning point. And so in math, it's a turning point on a curve where the slope changes.

(00:16:16):
But in tech startups, it's a point in time where something new gets introduced that creates new empowerment for the first time possible. And so people talk about timing and why now? Inflections for me were the unlock. You could have had the idea for ride-sharing before the iPhone 4s, but it wouldn't have mattered because the riders and the drivers wouldn't have been able to locate each other well enough. If you'd waited too long after the iPhone 4s, it would've been obvious. And so there was this window of time, this magical moment when a new type of empowerment was possible for the first time ever. And the companies that the founders who understood that were in a position to offer that kind of empowerment in the form of a radical product that changed the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
To make it even more real for people. What are some other examples of inflections either in the past, in the present?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:17:10):
Another example would be the cameras getting better on the smartphones, which enabled Instagram. So Instagram was at the convergence of a few inflections. First of all, there were smartphone adoptions. There were just more of them. And so they crossed like 10 million smartphones, but then you had the cameras getting a lot better. You had more of them connected on Wi-Fi. You had the networks having better upload speed for smartphones. So all those factors converged and made it possible for Instagram to offer a product that was good enough to take most of your photos with. You didn't start to think, "Oh, I need a digital camera separate from my smartphone. Now I can just use my smartphone everywhere I go." But Instagram could have come out in 2008.

(00:17:59):
It probably wouldn't have worked it probably, or it wouldn't have worked to the extent that it did. Its window of timing was just right. What are some other examples? The locator chips in the smartphones powered other companies as well, it powered DoorDash, Instacart. They had different insights which we'll get to, but there were lots of different ways to harness that power. One thing I love about inflections, and this kind of goes really old school, is just because you have a power doesn't mean you know how to use it, right? So the wheel was mounted horizontally for 500 years before somebody mounted it vertically. So originally people used the wheel to make pots, and that was a good innovation because it accelerated making pots, but then somebody decides to mount it vertically, and now you're propelling wagons and you just change transportation entirely.

(00:18:58):
And so most people don't realize that the thing that's underneath us or the thing that's in our hands or the thing that's in our pocket might have a power that when unleashed could change the future. And it's one of the very special things about founders that are great is they recognize, they notice things that we don't know. All of us tend to just follow the patterns we've always followed because most of us tend to assume that tomorrow will be similar to yesterday, but sometimes the founder will notice an inflection. And I find that kind of inspiring because inflections are all around us all the time, but most of us just don't bother to look. Most of us are so busy going about our day to day that we don't notice the emergence of a new empowering thing right under our nose or right in our pockets, but some founders do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):
It makes me think about ChatGPT when it came out, it was sitting on top of an existing model and it just gave people a new interface to use it, and all of a sudden, everyone crazy, they're like, "Oh my God, that's the future." But it was already there. You couldn't chat with it the way that people wanted to chat.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:20:05):
Like Michael Saylor, once I was talking to him and he said, the Romans could have invented the printing press a lot earlier. They had sandals that would make marks in the mud. You could have, in theory, drawn the connection between those marks in the mud and the ability to have movable type and letterpress, but nobody did. And so quite often these inflections, they'll just go unrecognized for a while, but they're always there. They're always there. They're there right now. In the ambient atmosphere, there's somebody about to harness an inflection that most of us would just walk right by and never see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:44):
Wow, my mind is racing, what's out there right now. Obviously AI is top of mind for a lot of people. I know you're stickler for what is an inflection, what does not? Do you consider AI an inflection?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:20:55):
I would say that I would probably be a little more specific about it. So I might say that certain large language models are an inflection because when I think about an inflection, and one of the things I emphasize in the book is stress tests. So it's funny, founders never really come to me and say, "Hey, can you help me come up with a good idea?" They would think they're weak sauce if they had to do that, right? So usually what's the more common occurrence is they'll say, "I've got this idea, what do you think about it?" And so what I can say to them is, "It's not my place to have an opinion, but let me just ask you, does it embody one or more inflections?"

(00:21:32):
And if it does, there's a few we could stress test that we can say, "What is the specific new thing that was just introduced? How does it empower people? How does it specifically empower specific people in specific ways? And under what conditions might that empowerment be realized? And under what conditions might it not be?" Because nuclear power has existed for a long, long time, but we haven't built any new nuclear power plants in 50 years. And so just because you have a power doesn't mean it's going to get used. It could get regulated out of existence. Customers could decide they don't want it. And so we want to answer all three things. What's the specific new thing? What is the specific form of empowerment it offers and to who?

(00:22:17):
And under what are the empowerment conditions? So like with the selection for Lyft, the inflection was the new thing was the iPhone 4s with the GPS chip, the empowerment was you can locate anyone within one meter accuracy with an algorithm, and that's going to be pretty much anybody with a smartphone. And that's a lot of people. And in order for this to be met, people are going to have to want to share their location information with applications. The government's going to have to not outlaw GPS chips and phones. Apple's going to have to keep wanting to ship GPS chips and phones. And we felt like those were pretty reasonable bets. We felt like it's pretty likely those empowerment condition will be met.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:58):
Amazing. I was just going to ask for an example. You already provided one. What about in terms of Twitch? What was the inflection there?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:23:05):
I think there were a couple. The first was the shift towards user generated content and sort of internet celebrities. Justin Kan wanted to be an influencer before there was a term to describe it, right? He was really building the product that he wanted for himself. But right before Twitch or right before Justin.tv, which was the original company, Time's person of the year had been you, and they had YouTube on the cover of the magazine. And so you had, that was a major turning point in how entertainment was happening. But simultaneously, broadband penetration had reached critical mass. The CDNs were getting really good, we thought that they would get better. And so you were in a situation where the conditions to live stream video for the first time broadly over the internet were being met. Whereas you could have done that even two years before. In fact, Kyle Vought had to invent some pretty miraculous stuff to even make it work when they did. But you could see how, okay, once video starts streaming on the internet in real time, that could be a thing. You could just see how that would be a thing if it worked. And so I'd say those are the inflections. Airbnb, company close to both of our hearts for different reasons. They benefited, I think from a couple things. One was the proliferation of customer reviews online and people's trust of reviews as a substitute for trusting the brand of a hotel. But then also Facebook Connect made it possible to pass people's profile information. And so the guest and the host didn't quite seem like as much of a stranger as they might've. And so there were a few things that happened at the same time, and then the great financial crisis. And so you had people upside down on their houses needing to find some way to generate income. So all of those things came together at the same time to help Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
The examples you shared are a good reminder that the inflection doesn't have to be technological. You shared a few of the categories of types of inflections. Can you just do that again?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:25:08):
I love that question, and I'm glad you reminded me because here's a really recent example. When the laws were changed because of shelter-in-place for telemedicine visits, it used to be illegal to do a telemedicine visit across state lines. But now all of a sudden with COVID and shelter-at-place, not only was it made legal, but it could even be reimbursed by the healthcare system. And so that's an inflection because it empowers patients to access more doctors, and it empowers doctors to access more patients, and it also changes the delivery mechanism in an empowering way.

(00:25:47):
In no event was that a technology change, that was a regulatory change that allowed technology to be empowering in new ways, but it was a specific new thing that meets that condition. It empowered specific people in specific ways, and there was a new set of empowerment conditions that ended up being made. And one of the things that we would ask at the time was, once COVID and shelter-at-place goes away, are they going to revert back to the old laws? And if they did, that would've been a problem. And so that would be the empowerment condition, but it's a fairly robust way of stress testing any inflection, right? Is to ask those three or four questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:27):
So there's regulatory inflections, big changes in regulation, there's technological, there's also, I think you implied an attitude, like the way people see [inaudible 00:26:35]

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:26:34):
Yeah, there can be a belief inflection.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
Belief.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:26:37):
So for example, during COVID, the amount of telemedicine visits exploded. And so as a result, there was a permanent change in people's belief about whether they would want to do a telemedicine visit. Before that, the technology was there, but a lot of people just didn't do it. The doctors didn't want to or decide to, or the patients didn't want to decide to. But now all of a sudden people were doing it, they're like, "This is much better. I'd much rather do it this way than go visit the doctor and wait in line and all that stuff." And the doctor's like, "I'd much rather do this than have these people backed up in my office." I would argue that here we are doing a podcast on a video platform, even though it's not Zoom, I would say that Zoom was another example. The idea of people working from home a reasonable number of days a week is a permanent condition, I think is another inflection that happened with COVID.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
And so are those the three, regulatory, technological, and belief?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:27:35):
Those are the main ones. And I would say that in many ways you could say that from a macro point of view, it's two things. It's technology changing enablement, and it's people socially changing their beliefs and their patterns of behavior. And either one of those changes can be an inflection because either one of those changes can represent a turning point in one's capacity to change the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):
Amazing. Okay.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:28:00):
... point in one's capacity to change the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):
Amazing, okay, so we've talked about inflection, the next bucket is, in the next element of breakthrough companies that you found is an insight. Talk about that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:28:11):
Yeah, so unlike an inflection, an insight does come from the founders. An insight, I like to say, is a non-obvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change people's behavior. So in the example that we gave earlier with Lyft, the inflection was the iPhone 4S, insight was, oh, that means you could do Airbnb for cars. And so, you had to have some type of a creative insight to see that. Now, what was non-obvious about it, or non-consensus about it, who's going to want to get in a stranger's car? That's crazy, right? And thank God ... I mean, if there's one piece of goodness about us passing on air bed and breakfast design, Anne and I were like, man, nobody's going to want to stay in a stranger's house, that's crazy. And at the time, air bed and breakfast, the host of the guest stayed in the house at the same time, and the host would feed Pop-Tarts or something like that to the guest the next morning.

(00:29:15):
This is right around the time of the Craigslist killings and stuff, where this is just scary and kind of crazy, couchsurfing as a service. But by the time we saw what was Zimride at the time, what became Lyft, Anne and I were much more prepared to believe that insight than we would've been because we'd foolishly passed on Airbnb. So that's a really important aspect of insights. So the insight needs to leverage inflections, but this is the subtle part, it needs to be non-consensus and right, not just right. So in the world of opportunities, if you're right and consensus, you still don't do that well. And an idea that is right but consensus has a couple problems to it. One is, if it's consensus, it's probably not radical enough.

(00:30:09):
Because when you think about it, human beings are conditioned to like things, and so, if everybody likes your startup idea, it means it's too similar to what they already know, what they're familiar with, which means it's probably too similar to the consensus, it's too similar to the incumbents, and so, the best startup ideas have this trait where most people don't like it or are even hostile to it, or just kind of meh about it. But some subset of people are just like, where have you been all my life? This is amazing, I love this. They fall irrationally in love with the idea.

(00:30:45):
And so, most of the great startups that I've seen have that attribute to them, and the reason is that a great startup, unlike a conventional company that proposes the future as an extension of the present, so that ... Normal companies forecast, they say, I'm going to look forward from the present and forward project what the future will be. Great founders, pattern breakers back cast, they say, it's a given that the future has to be radically different for me to be a big winner, and so, I'm going to look for radically different futures and work backwards from those radically different futures.

(00:31:23):
And so, the radically different future comes from that thinking different, thinking non-consensus. And then, it's the different actions that get you to say, okay, now I'm out in this different future, but right now, I'm all alone in this different future. I have to get people to come join me in that different future, and I have to find people who are ready to move with me to that different future. And that's where the pattern breaking actions come in.

(00:31:47):
And not everybody's going to move at first, and so, I can't waste my time with people who won't move, I can't waste any URGs of energy on anybody other than those ready to move or are about to move. And then, I need to co-create the future with those early believers. And so, great startups happen when a subset of people in this world buy into the founder's insight, and then move with them to co-create that future. And then, eventually, what was a heresy becomes the conventional wisdom as more and more people start to realize the advantage of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, one is the Airbnb story. Interestingly enough, I had Jessica Livingston on the podcast recently, and you probably know this, but Paula Graham and her did not like the Airbnb idea. They all were like, this is a terrible idea, we are going to assume they will change the idea, but we love the founders, we're going to take a bet on them.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:32:35):
So I was introduced to the guys by Michael Seibel, who was one of the co-founders of Justin.tv Twitch, and Michael introduced me to Brian Chesky before they applied to Y Combinator. So Michael's like, they're not even close to ready to apply to YC, but he thought that I maybe would think that it was the right kind of crazy. I get pitched by a lot of ... I'm not very off put by crazy ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
I could see why.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:33:03):
And the meeting was totally discombobulated, so room full of cereal boxes, I'm like, what's up with this? Why is there cereal here? And then, he can't get the product to work, and I'm like, okay, that's okay, let's just look at the slides. And he goes, well, Michael Seibel told me that you don't slides, you like demos. And I was like, that's true, but it's not working. So we're like, 20 minutes into this meeting in a room full of cereal boxes just looking at each other. And you can't win them all, right? You win some, you lose some.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):
I wouldn't blame myself if I were you, [inaudible 00:33:37].

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:33:37):
Here's the other thing that's hilarious about Airbnb, so they do this thing because they can't pay their rent. They put up this WordPress site to pay for their rent because there's a design conference in San Francisco. In the meantime, they're brainstorming startup ideas, so they wanted to do a startup together, but it never occurred to them at first that air bed and breakfast was the startup idea. They're like, we just need to use that to make money so we can go do a real startup. And so, that's the irony, too, is that, you look back on it and almost smile at the fact that they didn't know what they even had at first, it was almost an accident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):
There's a lesson there of, you find something that works, and even if you don't think it's a big idea, don't take that for granted.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:34:21):
Oh, I very agree. And the other great lesson is, you don't want your initial startup bets to be too big to fail. You want ideas that are small enough to fail a lot because you don't want to be attached to success, you want to be able to just try things and play with stuff and tinker with things because you don't really know where the fractal of new insight is going to reveal itself. And so, there is a little bit of play to this that I think is pretty important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:53):
Do you remember some of the ideas they were brainstorming, by the way?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:34:56):
I don't. I wonder if even they do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):
Yeah, probably not, probably not.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:00):
It's probably in The Airbnb Story, their book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:04):
I feel like them failing in your demo helped prepare them for YC, and that's what helped them get in, so I think that you're a big part of their story.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:10):
And to make it even more painful, I'm in the book. Somebody called my wife Julie the other day and said, is that your husband in the Airbnb story? And we get the book, and there's a chapter, and it talks about how hard it was to raise money. And they weren't dissing on me as a dumb VC, they were like, look how bad we were at presenting this at first. It was just a complete catastrophe presentation. But that's another good lesson for me, too, I learned a very permanent lesson from that, which is, just because the presentation's good or bad, it has nothing to do with whether you should necessarily invest or not. Sometimes you have to be awake to the possibility of what it's going to be regardless of how messed up the presentation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:55):
What was their evaluation at that point?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:35:57):
Oh, this hurts to ... I think he offered me a chance to invest it at $1.5 million valuation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
But now they're a $100 billion business, I believe.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:09):
Oh, yeah, I would've made like, 6,000 times more money or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:10):
Okay, great, [inaudible 00:36:14].

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:13):
Thank God I said yes to Twitter and Justin.tv, and we said yes to Lyft and Okta, because if we'd seen all of those and passed on all of them, I'd be apoplectic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
I think that's what's interesting about your stage of investing is, you just need a couple to work out for you to win.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:35):
Yeah, that's right. And by the way, it's true when you're a founder, too, if you do this right, you only have to be right once. And so, that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):
Coming back to the insights lesson, one thing that you brought up when we were chatting about this is the importance of being surprised and the power of surprises. Can you talk a bit about that?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:36:56):
Yeah, so there's a couple of things about insights that I think are really important, and this is one of them. I believe that there can't be a recipe for breakthrough. And why is that? Well, recipes exist for things that have already been discovered, so if I give you a recipe for making a cake, somebody has probably made that cake before, the exact way they're defining it. And so, breakthroughs, though, by definition, haven't happened yet, they haven't been discovered. The general theory of relativity had to be discovered by Einstein, and the idea for ride-sharing had to be discovered by the ride-sharing companies, or Airbnb, by Chesky and Nate and those guys. And so, what you want to adopt is the right mindset. And how do you adopt the right mindset? You interact with new technologies at the cutting edge, but you actively savor surprises.

(00:37:52):
And when you think about it through the lens of a breakthrough and what we just said, it makes sense, because if you want to find a breakthrough, you want to be surprised, you want to discover the undiscovered, you want to know something you didn't know before. Because if all you do is an experiment that proves, that validates what you think, you didn't really learn anything, when you think about it, you just doubled down on your existing understanding or opinion. I learned this lesson from Scott Cook, who was the founder of Intuit. Whenever he would be presented a new product, people would present the idea to him, and he would say, what were your three biggest surprises as you were coming up with this plan? And what he would find is, quite often, they couldn't name any. And he felt like when people can't name the surprises they came up with, they're too brain locked on what they want. They have the agenda they have, they want validation, rather than truth seeking.

(00:38:51):
And so, if you're an authentic truth seeker, you're always hoping to be surprised, and you think of surprise as a gift, because you think, wow, maybe I encountered that surprise before anybody ever has. And so, that's kind of what we mean. And you want to construct your experiments so that you're in a position to be surprised. So a good example would've been what the guys at Chegg did. So Chegg was wanting to see if people would do textbook rentals, so they created a fake site called Textbook [inaudible 00:39:21]. But here's where Osman and Aayush were very savvy. Rather than just test whether people would rent a $100 dollar textbook for $35, they tested an arbitrary set of prices, all the way up to $75. And so, they had the demand preference curve at different prices. And Textbook [inaudible 00:39:42] wasn't a real site, so you'd get to the shopping cart and it would give you a 404 error.

(00:39:46):
But we could tell that people wanted to rent textbooks, and the surprise was that they would rent them for more than we thought. We thought we need to get at least 35, but some students were willing to pay 75. And so, that understanding was huge, if we'd only done an experiment to validate the hypothesis of, yes, will they rent it for 35, our pricing model would've been totally different from, oh, wow. And when you think about it, it makes sense, the student didn't want to keep the textbook. Econ 101, I'm going to give it back anyway, so 75 bucks is less than 100, I can buy beer with the extra money. So that would be an example of the surprise.

(00:40:22):
But most of the startups that have had great outcomes, I find, there was a kind of surprise like that. Being non-consensus is not the same as being contrarian. Being contrarian is another form of conformity because it's still relative to somebody else. Most of the great founders I see, they almost feel guilty that they found this secret, but they earned the secret by tinkering with the future and noticing surprises, and having their noticing filter tuned to volume 11, where most of us wouldn't notice it, most of us would just pass the secret right by because we're looking to validate what we think is already true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:03):
You referenced this term that is also one I love that you use occasionally, this earned secret. Can you talk a bit about that? It's basically the same idea that you uncovered something by trying things that no one else has seen yet. Is that the general idea?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:41:15):
So to me, secrets are earned. A lot of people, I think, have the wrong idea of what vision is. A lot of people tend to think visionaries as like, they have a special pair of binoculars, and they can look out farther than the rest of us can. But in my experience, that's not how inventions really happen, the way inventions happen is, people get their hands dirty and they learn about what's missing in the future because they're getting their hands dirty with what's new about it. And so, they earn the secret by going down this rabbit hole of exploring something at the cutting edge for its own sake.

(00:41:57):
And just like I'm a trained spotter for startups, they become a trained spotter for this new thing that they're excited about. And they frustrate the people around them, they'll be at a party, and everybody's talking about the basketball game, the Celtics against the Mavs, and somehow that reminds them of the fact that they want to test prices for textbook [inaudible 00:42:17]. But they're that interested, it's the last thing they think about when they go to bed, the first thing they think about when they wake up. And so, that's where I find most of the really great earned secrets come from, they're earned in the sense that you earn them by getting your hands dirty, and you earn them by being awake to the possibility that secrets are there or that just most people aren't looking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
This connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot. It all connects, where you're just trying stuff, you're learning, seeing things people haven't tried.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:42:49):
That's right, and in the early days of product market fit, I like to say we want to answer a very simple but profound question. What can we uniquely offer that people are desperate for? And if we have an insight, that makes us unique. Now, if a customer doesn't like your idea, a couple of things could be true. One is, your insight could be wrong. If your insight's wrong, you don't have a startup, you should just stop. The other thing, though, that could be true is, your implementation is wrong. So you had the right insight. So like Okta, at first, they wanted to do cloud systems management, they thought that they needed to do problem resolution, but when they showed it to customers, they were kind of meh about it. And they said, well, why are you meh about this? And they said, well, it's not a top priority. And they said, what is your top priority? And they said, identity management.

(00:43:40):
So they had the right insight, which was, customers would struggle to manage cloud services, but they had the wrong implementation of the insight, so then they came back with identity management, and it worked. So if somebody doesn't like your idea, if they're not desperate for it, either the insight's wrong, the implementation's wrong, or you could be talking to the wrong customer. Some people that Okta talked to wanted to integrate it with on-prem software. And in that case, their opinion's irrelevant because they're not an innovative customer, they're not living in the future, they're not going to give you product requirement ideas that are additive to your strategy. And so, you want to be, right insight, right inflections, right implementation, right early believers that you're talking to, as you iterate towards product market fit. And if you're not succeeding at product market fit, then one or more of those variables isn't working yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):
I think this might be a good time to remind people that you don't need to have every one of these for your business to potentially be a huge success. It's more that, the more you have, the more likely it is that you will find something massive. Is that right?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:44:50):
That's right. And this is the hard part about being non-consensus and right is, you don't know for sure that you're right at first, you only know that you're non-consensus. And so, you have to be willing to risk being wrong to be spectacularly right. And so, what you're trying to do, though, is pursue opportunities where the odds are massively in your favor. And so, I kind of return back to, business is never a fair fight. And so, if I'm a founder, there's a universe of ideas I can pursue. The mistake that a lot of founders make, and it's very understandable, they say, I want to go after big market opportunities. So they analyze big markets, they find unserved customers with unmet needs in under-addressed markets, so then they go build a product to go solve that problem.

(00:45:38):
And that's very appealing, because it seems obvious, and the dots connect forward in an obvious way. But unwittingly, it buys into a context, it buys into the current definition of the market, which was already set by the incumbents. And so, what you instead want to do is pursue a slightly more ambiguous opportunity, but one that harnesses these powers. Ones where you look at the inflection and you say, wow, that's really powerful, you look at the insight, and you say, yeah, I know that this is going to be, in the future, I know that this is where things are going to be radically different someday. I would rather have those things present and be willing to pivot the product than not have those things and have a much clearer idea of what the product should be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):
Funny enough, one of my biggest investment successes that exactly what you're saying you shouldn't do, which is, they looked at a huge market with a bad incumbent and built something better, and it's working. But I think, again, it's not that you can't win that way, your point and your research shows that your chances are a lot higher doing something totally different.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:46:42):
That's right, and I would bet that this company ... I don't know enough about it, I don't know what it is, but it wouldn't surprise me if they harnessed inflections in some way that was disorienting to the incumbent. It wouldn't surprise me if they found a way to use inflections to fight an unfair fight. What I try to do with the insights is, I realized there was a theory behind it. A theory is not a recipe, it's an explanation. And what inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on [inaudible 00:47:11]. And the insight is the vessel that they use, right? It's kind of like, the rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. And so, that's what we're looking for, we're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rule to favor us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:32):
Great segue to the third bucket and the third element of Breakthrough Company's Future-Founder Fit. What is that?

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:47:39):
Yeah, so this is one of my favorites. So a lot of times, people will say, what makes a great founder? And there are some common traits, passion for the idea, persistence, resilience, all these things that people talk about, passion for the users. But what I find is that there's no canonical best founder. So Marc Andreessen started Netscape as a programmer making minimum wage at the University of Illinois. And everybody thought the digital highway at the time was going to come from Time Warner or from Microsoft Network or from the US government, nobody thought that some kid was going to do it from the bottoms up. But it turns out that Marc was tinkering with a set of inflections around the World Wide Web. And right around that time, Microsoft introduced a better version of Windows, and right around that time, the Pentium processor came out, so there were more and more people [inaudible 00:48:36] graphical user interface computers at the very time that browsing started to happen.

(00:48:41):
But let's take another company more recent, Applied Intuition, makes simulation software for autonomous vehicles. If you're going to sell a giant contract to the CEO of a car company, he needs to look at you across the table and think, these guys can do the job. So Qasar and Peter, they'd grown up in Detroit in Michigan, they had worked at car companies in the past, in the big three, and then, they worked inside of Google at Waymo and Google Maps. And they'd had a successful startup before, and so if you looked, what is a team from Central Casting to do this, it would be them.

(00:49:22):
And so, what I mean by Founder-Future Fit is, there's a set of traits that a founder can have that make them ideally suited to a certain type of future. Sometimes they're really young first-time founders, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, we just gave the example of Marc Andreessen. In that case, usually they're at the cutting edge of a new technology and they have a beginner's mind, and they aren't even encumbered by the old way of looking things. It's like, the entire world lives in Cartesian coordinates and they discover polar coordinates, and they don't even have to translate between the two because they never understood Cartesian coordinates.

(00:50:01):
And so, in that case, their knowledge about the future is more valuable to success than their knowledge as business people. But in the case of Applied Intuition, if you're selling very large contracts to enterprise customers, they need to believe that you could do the job. If you're Okta and you're doing identity management for cloud customers, they're going to trust Todd McKinnon from Salesforce way before they're going to trust a college dropout to do that job. And so, I like to say Founder-Future Fit is, who knows the most about this future? Who has the most intrinsic motivation to pursue it? Who has the best network and keeps the best company in that ecosystem of the future? Those are the types of things that ... Founders that show up differently on those dimensions usually do better because they're more likely to understand what to build in the first place, and they're more likely to convince early believers to believe in their ideas in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):
So it's not that these people have some vision of the future that is more accurate or more incredible than everyone else, it's that their background, and even the way they look, matches the problem that they're going after. So in this Applied Intuition case, you're saying the founders look like people that a CEO of GM would be like, I trust these people to build this thing for me.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:51:25):
Yeah, Louis Pasteur once said, chance favors the prepared mind. And when I started working on this book, for the first time, I really understood what he meant. Chance favors the prepared mind because a prepared mind attracts luck. A prepared mind is better positioned to notice a breakthrough than other minds. And a prepared mind sees the breakthrough, sees around the corner, because they're thinking about the subject all the time. And so, most people think that the way you come up with good startup ideas is to try to think of a startup. And I like to say, no, that's exactly wrong, what you do to come up with great startup ideas is, you live in the future, and you notice what's missing in the future. And it's axiomatic, if you're living in the future, there will be unbuilt, missing things, because if it was all built, you'd be living in the present. And so, if you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.

(00:52:32):
So Andreessen didn't do the Mosaic browser because he thought there was a market for browsers. He didn't even know about a digital highway, he was trying to make the internet immediately more useful for him and his team. And his intuition about what to build was very good because he was building the thing he wanted that was missing in the world. In the case of Okta, they knew all the early Salesforce customers, but the principle still applies, those customers weren't equal, they were lighthouse customers. It was kind of like when I was at Silicon Graphics, I didn't spend time with normal movie studios, I spent time with industrial Light & Magic, because I thought, if we solve their problem, they're going to take us to the Promised Land. All the stuff we build for Industrial Light & Magic will be the stuff that everybody wants someday. And so, not all customers are equal, you want to find customers that live in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:24):
I love this point. Justin.tv is another great example of this, where he just assumed the future, everyone's going to be watching each other's reality show, so he built his own backpack with a camera [inaudible 00:53:34] just to stream himself.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:53:34):
Yeah, and the Justin.tv example is a great one, too, because in Justin.tv, he built the thing that he wished he had, even though it was a terrible idea. But it embodied attributes, it embodied these inflections of these insights that led them ultimately to Twitch. Ironically, Justin's second company, Atrium, most people thought that that made sense, automating legal tasks. And Justin's a great founder, but Justin just didn't like the legal field, he had no passion for it. When he started Atrium, his passion was to be a higher status founder. And I've got a podcast with him recently where he talks about this, where he's like, I wanted to be as big as Patrick Collison and Brian Chesky and Drew Houston. But it turns out, that's not a very good reason to start a company. Founder-Future Fit is ultimately about authenticity, and it's about, who is the most authentically matched for that different radical future? And whoever that team is has a really big head start at getting product market fit. And product market fit is the game, whoever gets it first wins.

(00:55:28):
Okay, so there's inflections, there's insights, there's Future-Founder Fit, to make this super real for, say, a product manager sitting at a company right now, I want to start a startup, or someone just starting to ideate on ideas, what are some things that you recommend they start to do this week, next month, to start to find a big idea, or to start an idea? It doesn't have to be a big idea, an idea that'll take them somewhere.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:55:52):
The number one thing I like to say is, get out of the present. And so, people talk about getting out of the building, and of course, we should, but getting out of the-

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:56:00):
And of course we should, but getting out of the present is a little bit more subtle than that, right? So William Gibson was right when he said, "The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed." So most great startup ideas come from a future that exists right now today. And so what I like to say to people, and this is a question that I always ask when I'm pitched, "Is this from the future?" And then some people will say to me like, "Hey, I have a mental health startup. Mental health is a huge problem. It needs to be solved." And I'll say, "Why is your idea from the future?" "Well in the future I believe mental health needs to be solved." I'm like, "That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what part of the future have you been living in that gives you the right to have an opinion about the future?"

(00:56:52):
So I like to say, "If you're not living in the future, your opinion about it isn't valid." It's like saying, "I think a customer will do X." And you've never talked to a customer. I'm like, "Okay, your opinion's interesting but irrelevant." And so the only relevant opinions about the future come from people who are living in it and coming from people who understand what's new about it in a very visceral way. And there are people who do a good job of this, like Maddie Hall who started Living Carbon. She was working at Zenefit and at first she tried to think of a startup and she had ideas that weren't that good. She had a laser tag idea and a few other things. But then she decided to go follow Sam Altman for a year to be his chief of staff.

(00:57:36):
And Sam Altman visits the future multiple times a day with people. And so that's what led her to this idea that for Living Carbon, which does genetically modified trees. I mean, it couldn't be farther away from Zenefit, right? But she saw Microsoft was about to spend a lot of money, a bunch of other companies about to spend a lot of money on carbon takeout. She saw that the genetic engineering technology was getting good enough that you could engineer these trees. She married the inflections with the need and then off she went. But she was basically sampling a lot of different futures until she found one that she liked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):
I love that example because it makes it very real what living in the future looks like. So one is spend time with people that are very far along on some edge of technology or the way people behave. Another you shared is a work with a company, say that you work with a silicon graphics industrial related magic...

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:58:34):
[inaudible 00:58:34] magic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Yeah.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:58:35):
Yeah. So McCracken had a term for it that I've always liked lighthouse customers. And so the lighthouse has this light that shines out and obscures the fog. And not all customers are equal and some customers are living in the future and those customers are gold. And those customers will, if you solve their needs, take you to the promise land. So yeah, you can build what's missing for yourself like Andreessen did or Zuckerberg or Steve Wozniak or Bill Gates, or you can build something for lighthouse customers you have a good relationship with. Or if you can do neither of those things, the number one question I get asked is, "Hey, that's great if you live in a supercomputer lab or if you were selling to Industrial Light or Magic or all the Salesforce customer. I'm not one of those. I'm a second year student at Stanford Business School. I'm a product manager at company X, I'm whatever the case may be. That's where the Maddie Hall example is really powerful. Because Maddie proactively got out of the present in a very intentional way. So I love her example as a case study.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):
What signs tell you that a company is one of these lighthouse companies living in the future or a person is just like, you just feel it, they're so far ahead of everyone else.

Mike Maples, Jr. (00:59:55):
Usually it has to do with how tech forward they are. There was a time when a lot of people didn't think the cloud was going to be a thing because it was insecure. And I'm not going to host my important data and let somebody else have it. But there were a set of customers who really excited about the cloud and they tended to adopt certain kinds of products. When I used to work in client server startups, you knew that the early adopters were people who were using relational database servers and scalable front end programming interfaces and things like that, were trying to have distributed apps that they would roll out. You could tell who was trying to play offense with the new trends.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):
Awesome. Okay, before we move on into actions, is there anything else you think might be useful to share in terms of helping people come up with an idea, find a great idea?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:00:48):
The number one thing about the ideas goes back to the not playing the comparison game. So the thing that I see people underestimate when they come up with ideas is the threshold of desperation required in the customer. So we want to solve problems for desperate people and it's like if we have powerful inflections that really empower and we have something unique, there should be somebody who is irresistibly drawn to that empowerment. They should say, "Oh my God, this is incredible. This is a game changer. I can't unsee that." Why is that important? I like to say that if a customer has the ability to do something other than what you do to solve their problem, they won't be crazy enough to do business with a startup. So customer has to be so desperate that when they see what you have, they're like, "I've got to have it."

(01:01:47):
And so I like to say, "You want to force a choice and not a comparison." If everybody's selling apples, I can't be a 10 times better Apple. I want to be the world's first banana. And I want to say to people, " You may not want bananas, you may not like them, you may not value the advantage of bananas, but if you value banana-ness, I'm the only person that's got it." It's like, "Come to papa." And so that's like an insight feels like that. And in the early days, don't spend any of your time with people who love apples because you're not going to convince them and they're going to waste your time. What you want to do is find everybody in the world that values the advantages of bananas as soon as possible, not wasting any time on the people who don't. And so I'd say that that kind of wraps up the idea of insights is it like we want to force a choice and not a comparison. Nobody looks at the Tesla cyber truck and says, oh yeah, well how does that compare to Ford F-150? And you may hate the cyber truck, you may think it's stupid, but nobody's neutral about the cyber truck. You want to have a product that people can't be neutral about, but that the people who magnetize positively to it just can't imagine a world without.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:03):
I love that. And going back to your banana example, you want just a few people to be just like, "I need that banana." No matter how much you're charging.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:03:10):
That's right. And even if it's halfway ripe, because that's the other thing, they need to be willing to tolerate the fact that you can't execute very well because how could a startup execute really well? They have no resources. And so the only chance for a startup to win is to win on a playing field where better doesn't matter where execution isn't as important as, "Got to have that thing. I'll take any version of it you give me because I am desperate for it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Speaking of execution, good segue to the second part of the chat, which is basically you looked into what do the most successful companies and founders do differently? And you also found three core things that they all do and many of them do. Movements, storytelling, disagreeableness. Let's talk about each one, pick whichever one you want to start with.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:04:04):
Yeah, so we've talked about thinking different, but it's like the problem though is that asking people to abandon the familiar for an uncertain tomorrow is a provocative act. All startups are fundamentally disagreeable. There are disagreement with how things are done, there are disagreement with the pattern of what is. And so we need as founders to persuade others to change their habits with our pattern breaking actions. And so what the pattern breaking founder does is they create a stark dichotomy between the world that is and the world that could be. And they create an irresistible desire on the part of early believers to move to that different future with them. And so I like to say there are three aspects to acting different, right? One is the other storytelling and the other is disagreeableness.

(01:04:59):
And so the movement piece is the front and centerpiece because most people when they think of movements, they think of it as more like social movements like Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, or they think of there's artistic movements like Cubism and Picasso. But fundamentally, a movement is a different way of developing a market than how most marketing people think about developing the market. Most people when they think about marketing, they think, "Okay, I've got a set of targets, I've got a set of programs. I've got inbound and outbound. I've got these things I need to do." What a movement does is it leverages a grievance of a minority against the tyranny of a majority. And it takes that and animates it in a way that those early believers are emotionally committed to moving.

(01:05:50):
So early customers are not animated by pragmatism, they're animated by belief. Early customers, early employees, early investors don't decide to go into business with you because of the practical reasons that you unlock. They do it for aesthetic reasons. They do it because they believe what you believe. And so a movement is basically a set of people with the same belief moving together to a different future. And when you think about it's equally the same, right, for the civil rights movement. And a movement is a way to crystallize the choice. If you believe in civil rights, you can't be half in on that. You either believe that it should be about the content of people's character, not their skin color. You can't be sort of not racist. You either believe or you don't believe.

(01:06:46):
The people who followed Martin Luther King bought into the aesthetically better future that his movement promised. And it turns out, and I don't mean to equate, that was a pretty important movement, right? It's like some movements are more frivolous. I say an artistic movement. But the notion is similar in that there's a set of early believers who believe they've been enlightened about something that the rest of the world doesn't get yet. And they think that the startup founder is sort of like the prime mover of that movement. And then what happens is that startup markets happen because the movements accumulate and accelerate and more and more people join them. And what was once heresy becomes the accepted conventional wisdom and now the company's no longer a startup, it's a company, and now all of a sudden it is a valid market and all of a sudden they're the status quo and they got to watch out for the next set of disruptor. So the movement is the first key thing I think in all of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):
Is there an example? Lyft obviously comes to mind with the pink mustaches just as the future.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:07:50):
Ride-sharing was a movement. In my early days starting Floodgate with Anne, we thought that seed investing was a movement. And so we thought that there was going to be a day where seed funds would be a permanent feature of the venture landscape, but people didn't believe that in the late 2000s. And so we're like not enough that we just succeed and invest in good companies. We need to get the best LPs in the world to buy into this. We need to get Phil Horsley and Horsley Bridge and Dave Swenson at Yale and people who are respected in the ecosystem to say, "Yeah, I buy into that." And so it was really important to us to get the right early believers in our movement. Judith Elsea at Weathergage, who had just started a new firm.

(01:08:40):
One of my favorite examples is actually an old one, Clarence Bird's eye. So you go into the supermarket and there's frozen food aisle. Well, Clarence Bird's eye discovered how to flash freeze food when he was up in the Arctic looking at Eskimos, and they were flash freezing their fish and he wondered, could you do it for other things? And he found out you could fruit and vegetables, but it wasn't enough to just flash freeze the fish or the fruits or the vegetables. You had to convince the trains to have a refrigerated car. You had to convince the supermarket to have a refrigerated aisle. And so he had to start a movement where a whole lot of people simultaneously believed in this idea of being able to eat food in a more convenient way, not always in season, not always grown locally from where you were. And so all movements have that characteristic where you kind of start with a higher purpose and then you move people to that different future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):
I'm trying to think about what are current movements that are happening. One that might be a movement is with LLMs just this bet that transformers are the future of how this is going to work, that just more compute is the answer versus trying to find something else. Does that sound right?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:09:50):
Another one that I really like is Tesla. So Tesla's mission says, "Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy." They don't even say they're a car company. So Tesla doesn't say, "Here's why we're better than Ford and Toyota." And this is really important, right? Because the great movements do appeal to a higher purpose. They don't say, "I'm better than company X. I'm Avis, I try harder than her." They appeal to a more aesthetically higher purpose future. And then they show that this startup is the vehicle for that movement to be actualized, which is kind of a good segue to storytelling.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):
One other quick example I'm thinking about linear is kind of pushing this movement of craft and design and experience matters in B2B software. And you shouldn't settle for something that you don't love.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:10:42):
Very much so. And you know what, Chesky, I don't think he even knew he was fully doing this at the time, but Chesky did this brilliantly with Airbnb. So he created a movement around living like a local. And so the other thing that a movement does is it turns the greatest strength of the status quo into its biggest weakness. And so Brian never said, "Hotels suck. Death to the Four Season." He just said, "Hey, look, when you go to Paris, you have a choice. You can hang out in the Four Seasons and it's going to be just like the Four Seasons everywhere else in the world. It'll be in the middle of the town, or you can live in Paris like a Parisian." And he's like, "I don't have to say that the Four Seasons is bad for you to decide to choose me. And oh, by the way, if you want to stay in the same kind of hotel everywhere you go, I'm not for you."

(01:11:31):
But so now let's say you're four seasons, your whole business is predicated on doing a good job of having a common experience that people could accept and that they're used to and that they expect. And so now you've taken all of the stuff that you invested decades in and turned it into something you have to apologize for all of a sudden. And so the great startups, they create movements not so much by criticizing the incumbent, but by showing the weakness in the strength of the incumbent. And then just saying to the customer, "Hey, look, you decide it's not up to me to decide what's bad about Four Seasons. It's up to you to decide whether you value my difference or not."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:11):
It reminds me of counter positioning from Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers book.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:12:15):
A hundred percent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):
So to make it even more practical for people that are like, "Oh, I need to come up with a movement for my startup. That's why things aren't working." It sounds like it's kind of here's how we want the future to look and why we're doing this. And then it's a combination of marketing, positioning, messaging, repeating it, social media, imagine is that roughly how to think about?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:12:37):
But I would also say that it's about storytelling. And so storytelling, there is a science to storytelling. And so for example, the hero's journey, you have somebody in the world that is the hero, let's say Luke Skywalker on Tatooine, dusty planet, he's bored out of his mind. And then a mentor shows up and offers them a call to adventure, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And at first they resist the call, but then something bad happens in this case, Luke's like, "Hey, I can't come with you. I got chores to do for Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen." But then he comes back to his place and it's all burned down the storm troopers killed his aunt and uncle. So then he accepts the call. The mentor has a tool and a magic. In this case, it was the lightsaber was the tool and the magic was the force.

(01:13:32):
And they need those things because the hero has to have a reason to credibly believe that they can beat the bad guy. And so then what happens is you find co-conspirators along the way, Han Solo, Chewy, ultimately the princess. You rescue her, you blow up the death star, you beat the empire, and then emerge, transform. They even get medals at the end of the movie, right? Now, it turns out that the exact same thing applies for startups. So if we take the Lyft example, let's just say I'm a rider. In the past, the world that is taxi suck in [inaudible 01:14:10]. I can't even get one. And when I get one, it's gross and it smells bad and it's late, and they won't take my credit cards. I have to have cash. They can't rely on them to get me there. I guess my alternatives to park, you can't ever get parking people break into your car. That's the world that is.

(01:14:28):
Logan and John would engage in a call to adventure, "Try this ride-sharing app. It shows cars on map, you know where they're all the time, they come within five minutes, fist bumped the driver." Now, this was where the genius of the pink mustache came in. So the pink mustache honored the fact that a lot of times people resist the call. It's scary to get into stranger's car. So the pink mustache made it seem a little bit less scary. When you see these cars driving around in San Francisco, you're like, "Hmm, what's up with that pink mustache?" And you're talking to your friend and they say, "Oh, it's this new thing called Lyft. It's pretty cool. It's an app if you've seen it." And so Logan and John did, among the best I've ever seen at honoring the fact that people might resist the call.

(01:15:13):
But then part of the story is languaging. This was the genius of Twitter. They didn't call it Microblogs, Inc., right? They created a metaphor around tweeting birds. The Tesla was this way, right? It wouldn't have survived a comparison with a Porsche of 9/11. The seats weren't as good, the radio wasn't as good, but Elon was telling a story about a different future. And when you bought the Tesla Roadster, you weren't buying it for practical reasons. You were buying it for aesthetic reasons. You were buying it because you thought that that future was something you wanted to be part of. So the storytelling primitive ends up working spectacularly well for startups, right? We need to describe the world that is, we need to describe the world that could be, which is that different future. We need to understand, and this is important that your job as the founder is to be Obi-Wan, not Luke.

(01:16:04):
So the founders sometimes make the mistake of thinking that they're the hero, but they're not. The early believers are the heroes, and it's the job of the founder to tell a story that emotes early believers to want to move with them and co-create the future with them. And the story you tell an employee is different from the story you tell an investor is different from the story you tell a customer because all of them have a different idea of what their hero's journey. If you're an investor, maybe your idea of being a hero is to make a hundred times your money and be on some fancy list and make money for your LPs. If you're an early customer, maybe you're a hero by solving an important business problem and getting recognized for it in your company. If you're an early employee, maybe it's you want to work on something you're excited about with really awesome people that don't waste your time with politics and bureaucracy, all of those are different journeys. All of those are different transformational ways to self-actualize. And we have to meet those people where they are and give them a reason to want to come with us to the world to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:10):
I had Nancy Duarte on the podcast. She is one of the most famous presentation designers, and she had exactly the same advice. When you're trying to tell a story, you basically bounce back between the world that is, the world that could be. What is, what could be. What is, what could be, and just keep going back and forth.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:17:25):
A hundred percent. In fact, Nancy is the person who helped me understand this better than any single person. So Nancy would show me how Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech. She'd be like, "Okay, well now notice what he does. He shows how bad phone suck now. They have styluses, they have keyboards." And then he talks about what could be, you could combine an internet communicator, you could combine an iPod, and he goes back and forth between how bad the current state of things is, how it should be, how bad it is, how it should be. Introducing the iPhone, how bad it was, how awesome it's going to be, how awesome it is. When you look at his speech, he's masterful at toggling. And by the way, the same is true. Abe Lincoln with the Gettysburg Address, "Four score and seven years ago, new nation, now we're in a civil war. We need to preserve what we stand for as a country. We need to go win this war." But he kind of goes back and forth drawing a tension between what has happened in the world that was, and the world that could be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):
Something that I was thinking as you were talking was, I've seen too many founders spend so much time crafting this amazing story and vision of their product, and they have this really cool blog post and big idea, but nobody really cares about their product yet. Do you have any advice of just make sure you're building something people want above all else. And the story is a layer on top of that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:18:55):
So many startups I see the first slide is like, "We're Acme AI software. We're located in San Francisco, we're funded by X and Y VCs." That's not storytelling because you're talking about yourself, right? And if you're trying to make the person in the audience the hero, they don't care about you yet. They care about how you're going to make them a hero. And so when you kind of say, 'Okay, if I'm pitching VCs, what I really need to do is help them understand why they'll be a hero if they invest in my company according to what makes them feel heroic." What you present is different, but what a lot of startup presentations do is they take their sales pitch and they rehost it for every other audience. They rehost it for the press, for investors and for employees and all that. And that's wrong because what you're doing is you're talking about yourself to different people, but what you want to do is describe the world that could be, the stakes that are involved, and then each of those individual audiences, you want to meet them where they live in the world that is, and show them how they can engage in a transformational journey to the world it could be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):
And also share your amazing stats and backgrounds and market size and all that stuff.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:20:19):
Yeah. Although it's funny, I've found that investors are the same. Investors, ultimately they believe or they don't believe. A lot of times, this is the other thing I see happen, is the poor founder will get advice from 20 different people about their pitch deck. And a lot of the people giving them advice are not believers in that different future. They're giving generic startup advice or they'll go pitch a bunch of firms and they didn't consider who's prepared to possibly believe, who isn't. And so then they get objections to their pitch from people who aren't going to believe anyway, and then they try to have a slide to meet that objection. And before you know it, you have what I call a Franken deck. And so you have this huge, gigantic presentation trying to anticipate every objection, and the person who was ready to believe you in the first place doesn't know what you were trying to say because you obscured it with all this other stuff. And so I find that just like with an insight, it's okay if most investors don't like your idea, what you want to find is the ones who are prepared to move with you and make sure they absolutely know why they should. To me, that's the ideal pitch deck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:28):
I love this advice. And just to be clear, this is like seed and pre-seed before there's a lot of traction, a lot of data and like that.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:21:35):
Exactly, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:36):
So what's your advice to a founder that's trying to iterate on their deck is it's just like, "Don't show it to too many people." Is it, "Stick to your guns."

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:21:43):
Okay, here would be my succinct advice. And other than that, there's about a million details. Slide one, you say what you do as if I literally know nothing. So it's not, "We're Airbnb, we're a marketplace for unused residential housing space." Bad. But you'll get advice that says to do that because VCs think marketplaces are hot, residential real estate's big. What you should instead say is something like, "We're Airbnb, we let you rent an extra room in your house." Because now as the VC, I'm like, ah, I know what you do. And there are a lot of pitches, I'm 10, 15 minutes in and I'm trying to understand what they do, but I don't know. So you just say, "Here's what we do."

(01:22:26):
And then the second thing that I say to people is, I think your second slide ought to be, here's the thing we know that's not obvious. So when I was raising fund one for Floodgate, I would go to an LP and say, "We believe that there's a gap between Angels and VCs. VCs are writing $5 million checks. Angels $250,000 checks. We believe that 500,000 is the new 5 million because of Lean Startups. We believe that there will be a new type of category funds called seed funds. Now, if you don't believe that, nothing else I'm about to say is going to make any sense to you, I can just give you your time back." [inaudible 01:23:06]. But then once, if they did believe that or they were in a position to lean forward, now when they start mentioning my competitors, I say, "Okay, well, recall Peter Fenton works at Benchmark, he's not going to compete with me because why would Peter Fenton leave Benchmark to start Seed Fund doesn't make sense. The only people who are going to try to compete with me from the big funds are the people who aren't performing."

(01:23:26):
But if you set the context of what your insight is, you can always come back to it. When they bring up competitors, you can always come back to it when they bring up objections and you can say, "Hey, remember I'm just telling you we need to agree on this insight for this to have a chance of being great." So what do we do? What's our insight? And then slide three is what, if any, proof points do we have? We have any customers? Do we have great founders? Is there something happened already that should cause you to believe that my insight is vowed?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):
I love this. I love this tangent we went on...

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:24:00):
... site is out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):
Love this. I love this tangent we went on. Let me come back to the actions that you found the most successful startups end up taking. We've talked about movements, we've talked about storytelling. The third is my favorite, I'm excited to hear you talk about it, which is disagreeableness. What is that about?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:24:19):
Earlier, I'd mentioned that you want to escape the comparison trap when you have your insight and when you have your idea, in creating movements and telling stories, you want to break free from the conformity trap. We always are under pressure to conform in this world, and people use the pressure of conformity to prevent us from exploring things outside of our limits. There's a book that I love called Jonathan Livingston Seagull, where there's a seagull who wants to fly at infinite speed, and all the other seagulls are like, "Look, we're just destined to eat crap off the surface of the ocean. That's just what we are. We're seagulls." He ends up getting banished from the flock because everybody thinks he's crazy. To me, the great founders are kind of like Jonathan Livingston Seagull. They're willing to pursue something that they're obsessed with, that they think has to happen in this world, and they're willing to sacrifice their status in the socioeconomic sometimes dominance hierarchy because fulfilling the mission is ultimately more important to them than fitting in.

(01:25:31):
You can't stand out if you always fit in. The only people who are different can really make a difference. That's kind of the mindset. I like to say a startup is a fundamentally disagreeable act in the first place, and there's going to be times you need to be disagreeable. I've seen this time and again. I hear people say to me, "I want to work with a founder who's coachable." I'm like, "I'm not really sure." Sometimes I used to joke that when I would meet with Ev Williams, my whole job was to give him advice that he ignored. I would say to him, "Hey, Ev. I don't think you should raise that much money, because I think you'll spend whatever you raise in 18 months, no matter how much you raise." He said, "Man, so you mean that startups almost always spend their money in 18 months regardless of the amount?" I said, "Yeah. I call it Mike's Law. It almost always happens, because once you have the money, all the pressure is on you to spend it."

(01:26:26):
He is like, "Man, that is a really good advice. I'd never thought of it that way before. That sounds right to me." Well, he proceeds to go raise a shitload of money, but he did stuff that I didn't think he should do, but it worked. I liked that in him. A lot of people would say, "Well, doesn't it bother you that he didn't listen to you that much?" No, because he was disagreeable, and he was the right kind of disagreeable. He didn't say, "Pound the sand. I'm not listening to you. La-la-la, I'm covering my ears." He listened and he understood what I thought the truth was. He just believed a different truth than I did, and that's fine. My job as the investor is to just help them see what my perception of the truth is, honestly. If they decide to go in a different direction, that's great. They're the founder, they're the genius.

(01:27:22):
All of them, not all of them, but a whole lot of them are more disagreeable than history lets on. My dad worked for Bill Gates when he was at Microsoft. Bill Gates is not a warm and fuzzy dude. He was tough. He was a hard ass. But great people are inspired by hard asses, as long as the hard ass makes ... You meld the steel in the heat of the flame of high standards. Sometimes people can't work for Elon Musk for very long, but almost everybody I know who's worked for him really respects him, because he has high standards, and he's not trying to win friends and influence people. He's trying to land on Mars, and if you're going to land on Mars, you got to be disagreeable some of the time. I just find that that is a trait that is under-appreciated in these great founders quite often.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
What you just shared reminds me of a recent podcast episode of Jeffrey Pfeffer, which I know you listened to, where he talks about the rules of power, how people acquire power, and the last rule is, "Understand that once you have acquired power, what you did to get it will be forgiven, forgotten, or both." Your Bill Gates example, I think, is a good one where people look at him as such a nice dude when, as you said, he was not so nice a lot of the time.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:28:43):
Here's the other thing, and by the way, I listened to that episode from beginning to the end, and I thought it was fantastic, because the next thing I want to do is go to Professor Pfeffer and say, "Can we cast these seven principles through a pattern breaking lens?" Let's assume you're a startup capitalist, you're not at a company, because changing the future requires you to acquire a different form of power than you would, say, in an organization. But as I was listening to it, I was like, "These principles all apply to pattern breakers, all of them, every single one." The other one is that I think that he said, "Not everybody's going to like you. If you want to be liked, get a dog. But if you want power, there's certain things you're going to have to do and reconcile yourself with."

(01:29:36):
Acquisition of power has this notion of you've got to wield the carrot and the stick. If all you do is wield the carrot, you won't create enough activation energy for people to move to that different future. Sometimes you do have to use the stick, and sometimes you have to realize that people are going to use your desire to fit in against you. They're going to say, "Oh, you can't do that. That's illegal," or, "You can't do that, that's unethical," or, "You can't do that. You're being some tech bro, bad guy." A lot of what I find with the founders I work with, ironically, before they win, they have to have the courage to be disliked because people don't like their idea. They think it's stupid, lonely.

(01:30:20):
But then after they win, it's even worse, because everybody says you cheated or you're a bad guy or you broke the rules or you're too powerful, or, "Who gave you the right to decide what the future should be?" They get criticized unfairly in the other direction after they succeed, but in the end, it comes with the territory. It's part of the job description, unfortunately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:43):
Yeah. Elon goes through a lot of that. Something I saw you tweet recently along these same lines is that most successful companies, there's tons of chaos internally, and everyone working at these companies is like, "This place a mess. How is this even working?" But your finding is that that's very common and normal.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:31:00):
Especially in startups. There have been times when I've said things like, "Execution doesn't matter," and people can misinterpret that. When I mean execution doesn't matter, I don't mean people shouldn't get things done or people shouldn't say, "What did you do this week?" But when I think of execution in a corporate sense, corporations in theory should always win. They have big management team, they have more experienced people, they have customers, suppliers, partners, brand, so a startup never beats a big company by executing better than the big company. Startup wins over the big company because it proposes a radically different future, disorients the incumbent, and sort of chaotically moves people to that different future.

(01:31:46):
But like every startup I've ever seen, on the inside was wild. It was like a capitalist mutation. It was trying to find a beaked finch in the Galapagos Islands that's never been discovered before, and it's all ambiguous all the time, and people are arguing about what the right direction is all the time. It's just messy, but movements are messy. That's what comes with the territory. A friend of mine, Robin Roberts, once said, "Make your mess your message." It's so true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:24):
Oh, man. That's so funny. I love it. I have a couple more questions before we wrap up. Before we leave the actions categories, is there anything else you think is important to share, any other lessons that we haven't touched on?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:32:37):
I think, Lenny, I don't know if you've consciously tried to do this or not, but on some level you've created a movement. No one has ever engaged people with product management sensibilities the way you have. I go to your site, and you even have merch for product managers. I'm like, "What?" I imagine the early posts that you wrote, it probably felt kind of lonely. It's probably, "I wonder if anybody's even reading this stuff," but it starts to accumulate. More people start to read it, more people start to tell their friends about it, and now all of a sudden, it kind of becomes a thing. In many ways, Lenny's podcast and Lenny's blog and Lenny's newsletter are all examples of facets of this movement that you're creating.

(01:33:26):
But your movement is not just about the stories you tell or the guests you have or the podcasts or the write-ups you have. You have a point of view about the centrality of a product manager in companies and in businesses and in the future, and honoring that the way Nike honors athletes. The point of view is the movement, just like the point of view is the company when it's a startup. This point of view is the story. It's the place that people want to go that got animated by the beliefs that you share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:06):
Fascinating and flattered. I have no intention of starting a movement. I could see what you're saying. That sounds like a lot of stress, but I guess-

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:14):
I think you already have, whether you met to or not, I think you have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:17):
All right. Well, I do have swag, and if you're on YouTube, this is our best-selling item, a hat that just says "Product Manager." People love it. I have it in the background. [inaudible 01:34:26]

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:25):
Can I wear one if I'm still not one?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):
Absolutely. You've been one, and so forever product manager. I'll send you a hat.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:33):
Hopefully, I can get grandfathered in for my past.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:35):
Forever. Forever PM Mike. Okay. I just have one more question, and this is around your last chapter, which I think is going to be useful to a lot of people. Your last chapter is about how to apply a lot of these principles to working at a company. Say you're not a founder, a lot of these principles still apply. What advice can you share for people, say, a PM, instead of large company to help them find pattern-breaking ideas, big ideas within the company?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:34:58):
The first thing I think is important to understand is that everything about a value delivery system when you're doing a pattern-breaking idea is different from a normal idea. The mistake that most companies make is they say, "I've got this new pattern-breaking idea. It needs to be a third of my business in 24 months or three years or whatever." Bad strategy. Let's take a company like, say, Apple, when they did the iPhone. The iPhone was a whole new thing. It was driven by, in this case, Steve Jobs the founder. You couldn't reconcile it with the original business of the Mac and not really even the iPod. You had to treat it as a totally different thing, and that's really hard for companies. Companies make the mistake of engaging in a pattern-breaking product, but they make it too visible or it's a career-limiting move if it fails. Pattern-breaking products have different types of leadership, different types of go-to-market motion as we've described, different types of ideas, different risk profiles. Instead of saying this company or this business is too big to fail, I need to make small bets that can fail a lot. The same is true with mergers and acquisitions. If I buy a company, I need to ask, am I buying a pattern-breaking company to break the pattern of my business and go in a radically new direction, or am I buying a company that's an extension of my current business? Neither is wrong per se, but the way you think about risk varies enormously.

(01:36:43):
Some examples that I have in the book of good examples are the iPhone, Steve Jobs, AWS, but some people objected. They said, "Okay, that's easy for the founders to do because they're founders of the company, and that's Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos." The other example I like is Skunkworks with Lockheed. When they created a fighter plane in a very short amount of time, and that's how they did it, they had an organization totally separate from the main organization, somebody with absolute power, and tried to make it not visible, tried to make it be separate. Because when you make it visible, you start to drift it back into the tractor beam of acting like a pattern-matching corporation. Another good example back in the day was Don Estridge at IBM when they did the IBM PC, but it's almost always an autonomous business headed by a maverick, and you're trying to do something discreetly different rather than a better version of what you've already.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):
This aligns very well with, we had two recent podcast episodes talking to PMs at companies that are doing zero-to-one stuff, Mihika and Tanguy. Tanguy had a really interesting tidbit along the lines you just talked about where he set up his team in a totally different time zone so that people that wanted to bug them just were sleeping during that time, and they weren't even online so that they could just focus on the work they were doing, and it worked out.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:38:09):
I'm mostly through that episode, and everything that I've listened to so far, I'm like, "Okay, that totally jives with what I've seen." The other person has an interesting take on this is Vinod Kochblok. Vinod basically thinks that what companies should do is take some portion of their profits, let's say 10% of your profits, and invest it in projects likely to fail, but with wildly asymmetric upside if they succeed, and then make them not visible to the mothership in the early inning. It's your willingness to fail that lets you have breakthrough success.

(01:38:49):
Any coin that says can't lose bad on one side of it might as well say, can't win big on the other side. It's your willingness to fail, and it comes back to departing from the consensus, right? It's your willingness to fail that enables success, and every time you depart from the consensus, there's a chance you'll be wrong, you'll underperform the consensus, but it's your willingness to do that that lets you outperform it. But there's no shortcuts, right? The coin that says can't lose, says can't win on the other side, and lose big says, win big on the other side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:26):
Mike, this episode is so full of nuggets, tactical advice, amazing stories, everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightening round, is there anything else that you think might be useful to share with folks that are trying to start a company or are already along with a company?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:39:45):
Yeah. The one thing I would say is that it's a lonely existence, and it's okay if most people don't like your idea. It doesn't mean you're right, but it sure as heck doesn't mean you're wrong either. There's not enough people in this world willing to stick their neck out for things that they believe that they see before the rest of us. Just for what it's worth, if anybody in your audience is one of those people, you have just my utmost respect and affection. I hope that in those times when it's tempting to not believe, it comes with the territory every great founder has faced, and it doesn't make you wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:34):
Amazing. What an empowering, inspiring way to end it. Mike, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:40:34):
Okay, here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:44):
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:40:50):
A book called The Five Regrets of the Dying, Top Five Regrets of the Dying by Bronnie Ware. She was a hospice nurse, and she would talk to people in the last 90 days of their lives, and she would find out the things that they'd wish that they had done in their lives that they hadn't. I always thought that that was a good book, because it reminds you about what's important, and it reminds you that it isn't going to last forever. Someday, it'll be the last day.

(01:41:20):
There's another book that I really like called Chase, Chance, and Creativity by a guy named James Austin, and I think that it's a good book because it talks about how certain people tend to attract luck more than others and actually that luck is created, you do make luck. I am just fascinated by this idea of luck and how it can be harnessed. I'd say those two. There's a whole bunch of them. I've always liked all of Clay Christensen's books. The other one that I kind of liked that I read recently is by Robert Greene, The Laws of Human Nature. I liked that one a lot as well. Then Nancy Duarte's book, Resonate, we talked about Nancy earlier, I like that book a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):
I'm buying that first one immediately. That sounds incredible. I need that book. Regrets of the Dying. I found it on Amazon as you were talking, and I'm buying it. Good pick there. Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:42:26):
I really liked the movie about Enzo Ferrari, and I have this huge affinity for 1960s cars, and the way that they replicated these 1960s Ferraris I just thought was magical. I thought that the guys that did the special effects and just the attention to detail I thought was just extraordinary.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:50):
I have not seen it. Quick aside, as I was buying this book, your book was recommended on Amazon for me, so good job.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:42:50):
Oh, good. Okay. Here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:58):
Good job, Amazon. I will point people to where to find it at the end of this series of questions, but next question, is there a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:43:08):
When I was young, before I got into computers, I had a job as a professional calligrapher, and so I really like using calligraphy pens. Not long ago I sort of discovered the world, it had been a long time since I'd reconnected with that hobby, I discovered the world of vintage fountain pens. My favorite product of recent times, everybody will be like that sounds esoteric, but it's a Mont Blanc 149 first generation celluloid pen. It was right after World War II, and it was the Germans coming back saying, "We've still got it." It was just a product for the ages. It has a flexible nib. Fountain pens don't work the way they used to. They used make flexible nibs so that you could write the way scribes wrote in the 1800s and stuff. But then people in the modern world break those nibs, and they use ballpoint pens anyway. But when I use these old flexible pens from 1900 to the 1940s, they're just magical. There's just nothing like it. Nobody's ever been able to equal that experience in modern times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:25):
Wow. I got to try one of these pens.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:44:28):
Yeah. I'll give you one of them so you can at least get a feel for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:33):
Wow. I'll give you a product management hat, I'll get a pen, a beautiful pen. I think I win in this exchange. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with folks that you find useful to come back to?

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:44:47):
I learned it from my dad. It sounds simple, but it's kind of profound, "Do your best." What he meant by that is he didn't mean be the best, he meant that life is a gift. You don't know how much time you're going to have. Every day is the gift of your time, and the best way to honor the gift of your time is to do your best. There'll be times you won't be the best, but if all you did was the best, that's all you could do. I remember one time, so I was a senior in high school, I'd already gotten into Stanford, I'm totally psyched, I'm going to go. Last week of the semester of senior year, and I have a test the next day in English.

(01:45:29):
My dad's like, "Hey, how are you feeling about the test?" I said, "It doesn't really matter. I get to drop it, and I'm going to get an A in the class, because I've got the goods, so I don't need to do well on it." He looked so disappointed at me, and he was like, "It doesn't sound like you're doing your best." What he was kind of getting at was that the people who achieve greatness, they think everything counts. I always got a lot from that with him. There'd be other times where I wouldn't do so well on something, and he would say, "Well, sometimes you make a careless mistake, but you did your best. That's all you could have done."

(01:46:15):
The idea of doing your best I find to be very profound, and it causes you to realize that the best way to show up in the world is to be your best self. There's only one you in this world, and the more that you can show up as your best self, you'll be impossible to compete with, you won't feel the need to copy other folks, you won't feel the need to compare yourself to other people. You'll compare yourself instead to the idea of perfection itself and whatever that means in terms of your own ability to do your best. To me, that's probably the most important life lesson I've learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):
Wow. As you said, very simple but very powerful.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:46:56):
It's powerful when you truly internalize it, right? When you take it beyond an aphorism, it's very powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:03):
It reminds me of your partner, Anne Marie Coe's advice that she got from her dad, which is I think maybe the opposite that she shared on Tim Ferris' podcast of just always do a world-class job at everything you do. You're doing a world-class job.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:18):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:19):
Amazing. Okay, I'm going to skip the last question just to end on that, because that was way too beautiful to Sully with another question. Just to give folks a chance to figure out where to buy your book, when it's available, how to find it, what they should know, do share.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:36):
I guess there's two main ways, right? Well, we've got a Substack. Not everybody's got to buy books, right, so there's patternbreakers.substack.com. Then I have a site, patternbreakers.com, but you can also get the book on Amazon or anywhere. It's already available for pre-order, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:54):
Amazing. I usually ask people how listeners can be useful to you. I imagine it's check out the book, share what you've learned.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:47:59):
My main goal is for the ideas to spread and to help people. Hopefully, it will have achieved that goal. But just anything that people can do to help spread the ideas. Co-conspirators wanted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:15):
I love these episodes where somebody like you spends hundreds of thousands of hours analyzing data and history and startups and talking to founders and just synthesizing all the things you've learned into a couple of hours. I love this. Thank you, Mike, so much for being here and for sharing all this wisdom with us.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:48:32):
Hey. Well, thanks, Lenny. It was an honor to be on your show, and it's been fun to see you do so well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:37):
Thanks, Mike. It's an honor to have you on the show. Again, the book is called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Mike, thank you so much for being here.

Mike Maples, Jr. (01:48:45):
Okay. See you, Lenny. Thanks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:47):

# “I like being scared”: Molly Graham’s frameworks for rapid career growth | Molly Graham

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've worked with many very high performing founder CEOs. Zuck, Cheryl Sandberg. Larry and Sergei at Google. Brett Taylor.

Molly Graham (00:00:07):
Google, when I was there, felt like two PhD students paradise. Facebook felt like 19-year-old hacker's dorm room. 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Our job as operators or as leaders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
When a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos.

Molly Graham (00:00:28):
You have to grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage, both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
Sarah Caldwell. She told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-curve versus stairs.

Molly Graham (00:00:46):
So Chamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, the way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years. But that is boring. The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs and you do fall, but then you climb out way beyond where the stairs could ever get you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
Today, my guest is Molly Graham. Molly was an early employee at Google, also at Facebook, where she worked closely with Zuck on building the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. She also worked with Brett Taylor on scaling Quip, which he sold to Salesforce. She's also worked with hundreds of companies and founders helping them grow into the leaders that they want to become. Today, she leads Glue Club, which is a community for leaders operating in changing, growing environments who want to develop themselves as quickly as their companies. Molly is maybe most known for her advice to give away your Legos, which we chat about. Along with basically all of her favorite frameworks and mindsets and pieces of advice that she's developed and collected over time. For leaders who are going through rapid scale and growth and are just struggling to keep up. I think of this episode as a high growth handbook for leaders who are experiencing rapid scale.

(00:01:58):
We cover the J curves versus stairs approach to career growth, the waterline model, and why you want to snorkel before you scuba. Her six rules for creating goals and building alignment, her rules of thumb for dealing with rapid scale and lots of change. The biggest lessons she's learned from Zuck and Sergei and Larry and Cheryl and Brett Taylor and so much more. Molly is incredible and you will be a better leader after listening to this episode. A huge thank you to Eric Antonow, Ashley Murphy and Sarah Caldwell for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

(00:03:01):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly. But many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like, which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift. With DX, companies like Dropbox, booking.com, Addien, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers. And what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:03:44):
If you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea. It's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com. Molly, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Molly Graham (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):
I feel like this conversation was in an inevitability. I feel like you're the kind of guest where it's like, we will do this someday. I'm such a fan of your stuff. I've read all the stuff you've put out there over the years. We're going to be talking about the best frameworks and mindsets that you've developed over the years that have been really helpful to you, to founders, to companies that you've worked with to help them with growth and scale and change and all the stuff that comes with success. The way I think about this, I want to make this the greatest hits of Molly Graham.

Molly Graham (00:05:06):
Love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:08):
And so I sourced what I think are the greatest hits from a lot of colleagues that you've worked with, a lot of people you've worked with. We've chatted about the stuff that you find other people find most helpful. So we're going to be going through all that stuff. But let's help people understand why they should listen to this advice. What's kind of the backstory on these frameworks? Where did they come from? Where did you develop them? Tell us that story.

Molly Graham (00:05:29):
So first of all, Ami Vora, who you have had on your podcast, once said to me that all advice is just someone telling you what they did. And I always think about that. Because I really think that basically what I tell people is I've made every single mistake in the book. And then I got to the end of the book and I started inventing new mistakes. So mostly what I feel is that I like sharing my stories because I want to help people. I want to help people not make the same mistakes I did. And I also want to help people make sense of what they're experiencing. But I started in tech in 2007. I actually started at Google the week the iPhone launched and a lot of my scaling battle scars come from a couple of experiences. They come from a year and a half at Google, which is not very long.

(00:06:17):
And Google was pretty big when I was there. It has thousands of employees. But my department, which was the communications department, was 25 people when I joined and it grew in nine months to 125 people. And that was really my first experience with just all the sort of things that I still talk about today. In terms of what it feels like to grow really, really fast and sort of all the tools that I started developing from there. After Google, I left and followed Cheryl Sandberg and Elliot Schrage to Facebook. And I spent five years at Facebook. And I joined Facebook in 2008, and it's important context because it was 80 million users at the time. We were smaller than MySpace. It was 270 million in revenue, 500 employees. It did not feel inevitable. Most people thought we were going to sell it to Microsoft. When I told people I was going there, they were like, isn't that place just like a site for college kids? And so I was there for five years and it was a crazy five years.

(00:07:22):
When I left, it was 5,500 employees, five billion in revenue, over a billion users. So a huge amount of what I experienced, what I write about, what I talk about in Glue Club, which is the community that I run, comes from that rapid scale at Google and Facebook. But I also, I left Facebook right after we went public, about six months after we went public. And I only like doing jobs that I'm highly unqualified for. I like being on learning curves so steep that I'm scared I'm going to fall off. And so I left and I wanted to learn what it took to build something from nothing. And so I joined this little startup founded by Brett Taylor, a startup called Quip. I joined a couple of months before we launched and ran everything that wasn't product and engineering there for him. And that was such a valuable experience to me because the experience of building something from nothing is actually quite different than the experience of holding on for dear life while things are scaling so fast around you.

(00:08:27):
And it really taught me about all the tools and skills you need to go from zero to one and then from one to two and how lonely it can be to build something. And we eventually sold that company to Salesforce. And then again, only take jobs I'm highly unqualified for. But the last really chaotic scaling experience I had was actually helping Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan start their philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And I basically helped them for the first two years of its existence or its sort of like first full existence. And philanthropy sounds calm. You know what I mean? We're like, oh, giving money away. Must be so peaceful over there. And CZI grew from, I think the week I joined, it was 30 people and we bought two companies that week and it grew to 250 people that year. And it was like using every single tool in my toolkit that I had taken from every other job that I'd had.

(00:09:22):
So my advice and frameworks, like I said, come from having made a lot of mistakes. But I've also sort of made a personal study over the last 18 years, believe it or not. Essentially what does it take to thrive inside growing and changing companies, not just to hang on for dear life. What does it take to lead in the face of constant change? And really the other piece that I find truly fascinating is what genuinely makes the difference between a business that grows but then plateaus versus these generational businesses. The ones that go on forever. Sort of the difference between a Twitter or MySpace and a Facebook. Billions in revenue versus hundreds of billions in revenue. So what I like to do is take my experience and use it to help other leaders. I want to give people tools that work. And I also want to be honest about how hard all of this stuff really is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Amazing. I say this a lot in this podcast. I just love the ROI that listeners of the podcast get. You spent 20 years toiling, struggling, working so hard, learning so much. And you're just here, here's all the answers that I've learned. And obviously not all the answers, but so many things that will help people avoid the pain and suffering that you've gone through.

Molly Graham (00:10:43):
That's the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:45):
Also, a couple quick threads I want to follow here. One is Ami Vora, who you mentioned. She's now, I think, head of product at Anthropic.

Molly Graham (00:10:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
Amazing. Former podcast guest, also speaker at Lenny and Friends Summit two years ago. This other point you just made about how you've always gone to places that have been way beyond your... I forget how you phrased it, but just beyond your current capabilities almost. And were very difficult. I just had Matt McGinnis on the podcast. He's CEO at Rippling, now CPO at Rippling, and just recorded an episode with him. And he had this really powerful quote that if you're ever comfortable at work and feel like, oh, I got this, you're making a huge mistake. Something's going terribly wrong. That's not where you want to be.

Molly Graham (00:11:23):
Yeah. I always say I get bored really easily, which is both a strength and probably my greatest weakness. So I like being scared.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Okay. So let's actually dive into some of your greatest hits of frameworks. And the greatest of all greats, when a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos. Some people haven't heard of this, many people have, so let's cover this. What is this advice of giving away your Legos?

Molly Graham (00:11:47):
So this definitely started in my experience at Google. And then Facebook was a masterclass in giving away the Legos. But the way I like to talk about it is basically when I watch leaders and employees go through rapid scale, I like to think of somebody putting down a giant pile of Legos in front of a bunch of kindergartners and then just being like, build something. And that's sort of what it feels like when you start. It's like, well, there's so many Legos and it's so fun. There's a lot of opportunity, but it's also kind of scary and overwhelming. And you're like, there's so many Legos. What do I do? Isn't there an instruction manual hidden under this pile somewhere? But then you start building and you're like, oh, okay. You build something and then you take it apart and then you put it back together.

(00:12:33):
And then eventually you start to get momentum and you're like, okay, it's like I'm building a house. I got this. It's a house. All right, great. And then you're like, I'm good at building houses. I was put on earth to build houses. And almost assuredly inside of scaling companies, as soon as you're like, I feel good at this and I should do this forever. Somebody's going to show up and be like, okay, it's not a house. It's a neighborhood. And you need to take this house that's kind of half built and you're going to pass it off to this other person that we just hired. And you are going to go build dog parks and streets and other things that are entirely unhouse-like. And what happens when someone does that to you is you're like, wait a minute. First of all, I'm not done with this house. And I'm worried that this person's going to screw it up.

(00:13:18):
I'm also worried that building houses is actually the most fun thing and that I'm going to give the Legos to that person and they're going to have all the fun work and I'm going to hate building dog parks. Or that dog parks are irrelevant eventually and it's going to turn out we're in the house building business. So there's this incredible set of emotions that come territorialistic, paired with excitement. Fear paired with joy. But eventually you pass the house off and then you go work on neighborhoods and you're sort of like, okay, dog parks, I'm good at dog parks. I got this. And then again, you get to the like, I'm great. I was put on earth to build neighborhoods. And immediately someone shows up and says, it's not a neighborhood. It's a country or a city or a world. And it just goes on and on and on.

(00:14:03):
And for me, learning this muscle of both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos. And learning that the emotions associated with that are inevitable. I've been doing this for 18, 20 years, I still get attacked by these emotions all the time, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give them away and move on to the next thing.

(00:14:33):
That is both the torment of scaling companies, which is that the ground is moving under your feet. And as soon as you're comfortable, someone will make sure that you are uncomfortable, but it's also the opportunity, which is that you can go from being someone that's good at building houses to someone that knows how to build entire worlds. And that is where the Legos metaphor came from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
That is such a good metaphor. And if you've gone through this, you so understand what this is like and what... And also just the Legos is metaphor is so good for the different things you build.

Molly Graham (00:15:06):
I have a very weird brain that for some odd reason just always thinks in metaphors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
[inaudible 00:15:11].

Molly Graham (00:15:11):
So it showed up when I was... At Facebook in particular, I would find that every so often I would have to have what I called a Legos talk with someone where I would just see them start to ask these questions like, why are we hiring that person? Or what's that team even do? And I was like, okay, we need to have the chat about the Legos. And then eventually it turned into an article and a whole thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
A whole thing. And just to be clear, the advice is give away your Legos, this is actually the path to a successful career.

Molly Graham (00:15:40):
I have watched a lot of people over many years struggle with feeling like they should hang on to the thing that they've been good at. And it almost always... Because, you know, essentially the nature of a scaling company is that the Lego pile is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger however fast that graph is going up into the right. I always say that's the graph of how fast your business is growing. It's the graph of how fast your company is expanding. And it's the graph of how fast your job is getting bigger. That means that if you actually just stay and build houses, eventually you're literally buried under a pile of Legos. Do you know what I mean? You held onto something that's down here and the opportunity is actually to stay on top of that pile and to learn to just give away your job every so often.

(00:16:27):
At Facebook, I got to a place where I was literally giving away my job every three weeks. I was constantly rehiring myself essentially because you have to sort of grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage of the opportunity that comes with companies that are growing and changing quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):
So people are hearing this, they're like, okay, my rational brain's like, I should give away my Legos. It'll help me. It'll be good for my career. In real life, it's very hard to actually do. To give away this empire that you've built, this team that you've built. This project that you're like, oh, this is going to be my thing. I know you have a really fun, useful tool to help people deal with that kind of irrational part of their brain. Talk about that.

Molly Graham (00:17:07):
So like I said, my brain works in weird metaphors. It's a weird brain. I was raised on The Muppets, and I like to think that this one came from, I guess, growing up watching weird animals. But basically, at some point I realized that this emotional rollercoaster that comes with scaling, with growing. With going through change, any kind of change. People feel that. Was never going to go away. And that no matter how good I got... Sometimes I think it gets worse the more senior you get, actually. Because you sort of feel like you're supposed to know what you're doing, and then you just get attacked by this monster that's like, who even gave you this job in the first place? So basically I externalized all these emotions that come with change into this little tiny monster. I named my monster, Bob. Your monster can be named whatever you want him to be named or her or them.

(00:17:56):
And Bob's job... I like to think his job is basically to make me the worst version of myself. He's the one that's like, oh, that person took all the fun Legos and you should go push them over and grab them back. Bob's job is... Bob's the one that wants to send the rage emails at 9:00PM and burn the house down. And the thing to learn about Bob is that, like I said, Bob never goes away. Bob is someone that you have to learn to deal with. But Bob's job is to make you the worst version of yourself. So your job is to let Bob do his thing, but not act on the emotions. Basically, all these emotions are normal and they are not useful. They are not the compass that should be telling you what to do.

(00:18:46):
But the other rule I have for managing Bob is a lot of people are like, oh, you're feeling off or tired or whatever. Go to bed and wake up tomorrow morning and you'll feel better. And the truth is that you're like, I want to send the rage email at 9:00PM. You still want to send it at 8:00AM. And a lot of these emotions just do not go away in 24 hours. So my rule of thumb from Facebook was give it two weeks. And the emotional, the sort of Bob... Bob is like these waves and they just roll through. So you made a new hire or somebody came in or you got layered or whatever. You'll have a set of reactions. And those reactions, again, they're normal, but they're not useful. They're not the ones that you should listen to. They are Bob.

(00:19:29):
And typically they go away in a couple of days, you get something new. Some new wave. But anything that lasts longer than two weeks is actually something you should pay attention to. It's something that if it's been around for two weeks, it's something you should go talk to someone about. Whether it's a manager or a friend or a coach or someone like that. That's the real stuff. Everything else is just Bob.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:50):
Is there a rule of thumb for when it actually, when you shouldn't give away your Legos? When it's like, okay, maybe you should fight back on this layering or whatever.

Molly Graham (00:20:00):
No rule of thumb. In general, I would actually say embracing change is far better than fighting it. And almost invariably, you cannot see what is around the corner, but it is almost always the thing to focus on. A lot of times I think inside of change, we get focused on the past, and one of the most valuable things you can do as a manager and a leader is help people focus on the future. I think... I'm sure there are times when people have done it and regretted it and it has led them somewhere.

(00:20:42):
I think being layered, for example, is one of the hardest things for people inside these experiences where someone brings in a manager above you. And I've also seen so many stories of that ending up being a great thing for someone. Even though they couldn't see it at the time. So in general, I would just say, step into the future and let the past go and see what you're going to learn. And sometimes you'll learn that it's time to leave or that this isn't the right pile of Legos for you. But it'll end up taking you somewhere that's worth exploring. Holding onto things almost always leads us to the worst version of ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
It's a very Buddhist way of thinking too. Just don't cling.

Molly Graham (00:21:31):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
Yeah. And I think another part of this metaphor, I don't know if you think of it this way. Is the Legos aren't even your Legos, right? They're like the CEO's Legos, the shareholders' Legos. So you think they're your Legos, but no, you're not in charge.

Molly Graham (00:21:42):
Well, it is... I will say one of the hard-earned things is it can feel very emotional and it can feel very personal. It can feel like your work... I don't know, it can feel like your life is on the line sometimes. Just your work life. Oh, gosh, this matters so much. And one of the things that you learn as you get more senior and just have seen stuff is it's going to be okay. A friend of mine says, careers are long and nobody tells you that. But they're long. And this moment feels so dire and it feels so hard and it feels scary and it's going to be okay. So yeah, it is hard to know in the moment. And I think the story is going to be long and this is going to be one chapter or maybe even a part of a chapter, not a whole chapter. So embrace the length.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
To build on that point, I've realized this is my fourth career doing what I do now. Whatever the hell this is. I was a engineer and then I was a founder. Then I was a product manager, and then what the hell I do now. Whatever this is, that's a whole different path.

Molly Graham (00:22:52):
You don't have a name for it yet, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:55):
I don't. I hate all the terms people use for this world.

Molly Graham (00:22:58):
Somebody called me an influencer and I almost ripped their face off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:23:02].

Molly Graham (00:23:02):
[inaudible 00:23:02].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):
Yeah.

Molly Graham (00:23:04):
Yeah, man. The most interesting careers are winding and they have starts and stops and failures and successes and control. Anybody that's been through a lot of this stuff, control is usually not the name of the game. It's usually just like, "Let's see what happens. We're going to try this and we're going to see what happens next."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
This is a great segue to another framework that I've heard from folks you've worked with that have been really impactful on them. So, Sarah Caldwell, who's a big deal at OpenAI, she told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-Curve versus Stairs career growth framework. Talk about what that's about.

Molly Graham (00:23:46):
I actually gave a TED Talk about this one a couple of years ago because I am so passionate about it, but you can listen to the very packaged eight-minute version of this, but I will tell you the real story because it's very relevant to a lot of folks that listen to your podcast. I was at Facebook for five years. Like I said, the first two years I was in HR and I was doing employment branding and culture work and I was ready to stay there. I think I had in my head I was going to stay there until we went public, that was my plan just because I wanted to help the company through that moment, again, in my head.

(00:24:21):
This guy that many people know, Chamath Palihapitiya, came to me and Chamath ran growth and mobile at the time. And he came to me and we had lunch and he said in his very Chamath way, "You're useless. What are you doing in HR? This is stupid. You should come work for me." And anybody that knows Chamath is like, "Yes, that is actually what he said." He managed to insult you and compliment you in one sentence.

(00:24:47):
He gave me all these options on his team. And then the last one he said to me was like, "I'm going to go build a mobile phone. Do you want to come do that with me?" And I had four simultaneous reactions. The first was like, " That is incredibly stupid. Why are we doing that?" And then it was like, "Is that actually a thing that we're doing?" And then it was like, "Whoa, I think that sounds kind of fun." And so I left the conversation at Chamath and I went and asked my boss, Lori Goler, who's the head of people at Facebook for a very long time, like, "Is this actually something we're doing?" And she was like, "I can't believe he offered you that, whatever."

(00:25:21):
And I basically just could not get it out of my head, but it didn't make any sense, A, that Chamath had asked me because I was in HR. Like, "What am I doing? I don't absolutely jack shit about mobile." But I had worked on a project with him and I guess he thought I was smart. And I talked to Cheryl and she was like, "Well, that project will be dead in two months, but you can do it because you'll still have a job here." My dad was like, "Well, don't do that. " And anyway, a lot of very wise people being like, "Don't do that."

(00:25:51):
But I kind of couldn't get out of my head. And my friend said to me, "You've proven you're really good at this sort of company-wide project management and HR. Why don't you go show yourself how actually good you are? Is this transferable?" So, I took the job and I spent the next six months feeling like an absolute idiot. I basically felt like a total jackass all the time. I was sitting in rooms with these brilliant people asking the dumbest questions of my life and at the end of the six months, Chamath, I think, took a lot of pride in giving me the lowest performance rating I've ever gotten in my life, and it just felt like falling off a cliff. Then, slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone and trying to explain to him why something he wanted to do was not possible. I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, "Oh, I actually know things." And slowly then, over the following three years, I became an expert in mobile. And I basically... The phone itself was a giant failure, massive, costly failure for Facebook, but it was not a failure for me. It was a huge job that taught me that I was capable of things that I never could have dreamed of if I had stayed in HR. It set me up to be capable of taking on things that I didn't know about.

(00:27:28):
Chamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, "Look, you can stay..." The way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. "You can be boring." To use Chamath, "And stay on these stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years and your title will change from manager to senior manager to director to senior director, whatever." And he was like, "But that is boring." And he's like, "The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs." Basically, that you jump off this thing and you do fall for a period of time. I always like to say it's about six to nine months, but then this thing happens where you climb out.

(00:28:05):
And the picture he drew had this J-curve sort of basically leading you to places that are way beyond where the stairs could ever get you. And to be totally honest, that has been my experience. That taking risks, accepting the sort of terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it. Part of the reason why Sarah mentions it is that I do give this sort of talk to people that are inside of really fast-growing companies, because it's such an important place to let go of Legos and jump off cliffs because there's so much opportunity. And it is a place where if you prove to people that you're actually good, if they believe that you are the kind of person that they can use to do lots of things, you can get these opportunities that you are just so deeply unqualified for, but they can take you to places that you could never have imagined.

(00:29:01):
You can come out of those companies with skills that no one would ever have reasonably hired you to do. But I ended my time at Facebook in product and did business development and hardware and a whole bunch of the stuff along the way. And again, nobody would've hired me to do that at the beginning, but it's just because I kept saying yes to things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:22):
Molly, I got tingles listening to this story. Wow.

Molly Graham (00:29:25):
Does it sound familiar, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
It does. I want to ask, jumping off a cliff, sometimes you fall, really fall and you keep falling. Are there any kind of traits of like, "Okay, this is one that might be a J-Curve and worth the risk of falling, and this is when you should probably just not, let's not do this".

Molly Graham (00:29:46):
Yeah. I just think there are different kinds of fear. We talk a lot about this in Glue Club because one of the thing, there is a financial fear, right? Leaving a job and taking a job that has financial risk associated with it, or leaving a job and taking time off, which is something that I spend a lot of time talking to people about, you got to do the math and you got to... Sometimes there is a type of fear that is telling you like, "This is not the right time." Or, "I don't want to be financially anxious for months and months and months."

(00:30:21):
I use finances because it's the most concrete example of a type of fear that you should actually listen to. And sometimes you can do the math. I always counsel people through that. I'm like, "What is the number that you need to hit so that you're not constantly terrified financially?" And that number is wildly different for people based on their background and their life. "Can you do that? Can you consult, can you whatever in order to take this leap?" But a lot of times fear is just you saying, "I'm scared I can't do this. I'm scared I'm not capable of it. Yeah, I'm scared I'll fail."

(00:30:56):
And that's the kind of fear that I think of as a flashing green light because... And it sounds like Matt McGinnis said this too, where it's like, "That's the kind of fear that's saying, 'Why don't you go prove to yourself that you are actually capable of this?'" Or if you fail, like, "You'll have learned something, too." You know what I mean? You'll have learned, like, "I took this job in product at Facebook as my last chapter there, and let me tell you things that people should never fucking hire me to do." I was like, "I am not a good product manager." But I've got a great product mindset. I can sit in a bunch of chairs and hang with the product folks, but I'm not the person that cares about the button. Do you know what I mean?

(00:31:38):
And I would never have learned that. I wouldn't have known who I was if I hadn't taken that risk and failed or at least learned that it's not something I wanted to do again. So, there's many different lessons that come from facing down those fears and jumping off the cliff, but mostly what it is is knowing yourself better and knowing where you go next from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:03):
That is such helpful advice. I also love how you frame this of, "Prove it to yourself that you can do this." It's not, "I'm going to show them that I can do this." Because the way you describe this, usually it's an opportunity given to you. "Hey, can you do this thing? We want you to lead this new thing." And the fear is like, "I don't think I can do that." And what you're saying here is, "Prove it to yourself that you can." Or, I guess, it's also, "Okay, maybe I can't and then I'll learn that and then I'll know more about myself."

Molly Graham (00:32:27):
Yeah, exactly. I mean, one of the greatest gifts in a career is knowing yourself. And that's a lifelong journey because who you are and what you want changes, but that knowledge and that gift, nothing accelerates your self-knowledge faster than trying to do something that you don't know how to do and that you're scared of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Probably the quote I use most on this podcast comes up again in my mind as you talk about this, this line that, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Molly Graham (00:32:59):
Hell yes, exactly. Well said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
There it is.

Molly Graham (00:33:03):
I haven't heard that one from you, so clearly I need to listen more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):
Okay, that's great. I'm glad I don't overuse it. It just feels like it comes up again and again, and I think your point about the runway and the finances is such an important one because that's a very real practical question. One thing I did when I took time off, I took a year off after I left my job. What helped me was I just created a runway goal for myself. I'm just like, "Okay, here's what it's going to cost me for six months or a year to live without any income. Am I comfortable just burning through these tens of thousands of dollars to explore and see something new emerge?" And so you just have to feel good. "Okay, yes, I'm going to burn all that money and that's part of it."

Molly Graham (00:33:37):
Yeah, that's exactly the exercise. You're saying "runway" I say "burn rate", so we both were raised inside of companies, incentive tech, but I think it is do the math, right? What can you afford? And it's both what can you afford and still feel safe? Because sometimes, I mean, again, I think that is different for everyone, but it is such an important set of math to do because, A, a lot of times that number is smaller than you think it is, then your brain makes it out to be if you have this sort of existential financial anxiety versus, I always say, "Specific financial anxiety is much more useful than existential financial anxiety." And some friends are leaving jobs and I'll be like, "Hey, your number is 5K or 10K a month. You have to believe that you can get a consulting gig that will pay you that. Do you believe that?" And it's like, "Either yes or no." And then, "Okay, either we're doing it or we're not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
The other part of this J- Curve that I think is really important to touch on is this idea of for the first six or nine months, you're going to be at the bottom of the J curve falling, still falling. And some projects don't last that long and then you're like, "Okay, total failure. I never emerged from this fall." So, is there any advice there? Just, how do you create that enough space to give you a chance to start to un-fall?

Molly Graham (00:34:49):
I mean, the most valuable thing that happens as you fall is learning. And even on the other side of failure, you've learned a shit ton. I always say, "The most important thing to do in the falling phase and the risk taking land is to learn to embrace being a professional idiot." Basically, being the one that shows up at the meeting and is like, "What are we talking about? What does that word mean?"

(00:35:18):
For a bunch of reasons. Number one, you can learn so much. And again, even in the face of failure, no one can take away your learning. Do you know what I mean? But the other thing is that it turns out that a lot of the questions in the world that, you're sitting in the meeting and you're like, "This is a dumb question. Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot." But then you get brave and you ask it and it turns out it wasn't a dumb question. Do you know what I mean? Turns out that everyone had that question in their mind, but no one was brave enough to ask it.

(00:35:48):
So, from a skills' perspective, again, regardless of outcome, being the person that sort of takes their learning in their own hands, learning no matter what and learning to ask those dumb questions, it's a superpower. I always say that, "Actually, my superpower is being a professional moron." Because I'm the one that shows up in a room and is like, "Do we have goals? What are we doing? Why are we talking about this? Why are we having this meeting?" And most of the time it's actually what I was hired to do, which is bring clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):
It's so funny. I just recorded a podcast episode with a PM named Zevi who joined Wix and he had this thought, he's like a very young PM, just getting started and he's like, "Okay, I need to be a 10X PM because that's what they expect of me, that's what everyone that is really good, that's how I think of a 10X PM." And then he went into his first meeting and he just failed and he just felt so bad. He's like, "I guess I'm not that 10X PM. They're all going to see that. They think I'm terrible." And then he did another presentation a little bit later and people were so impressed with how he learned and evolved and improved. And he realized that he needs to be not a 10X PM, but a 10X learner, and that's what people actually expect from someone, especially a junior person.

Molly Graham (00:37:05):
Yeah. Well, I was having a conversation last night with a friend of mine who has a senior in high school and I was like, "What is the plan? What are we telling this senior in high school to think about relative to their career given everything that's going on with AI?" And we talked about it a bunch, but what we both circled back to was this idea of soft skills and that actually the only thing you can really anchor on right now is that teaching kids grit, teaching them hard work, teaching them learning, right? Learning how to learn, loving learning, being able to fall, in a world that's changing this fast. And I say this inside of companies too, right? I always say, like, "What you know today is way less valuable than what you can learn by tomorrow." If you're inside of a company where the growth curve is like this, what you know today is irrelevant.

(00:37:52):
Somebody once told... I'm sure this is faster now, but they rewrote the entire code base at Google every eight years, which means that if you're not learning, if you're not evolving, then you become irrelevant and extinct. It's actually the whole underlying point of the Legos stuff is that evolution is the way you stay on top, and I think that's more true today than it's ever been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):
And luckily, AI is really good at helping us learn.

Molly Graham (00:38:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:17):
So, that's good. Thank you, AI. And this actually comes up a bunch in the podcast. I ask a lot of AI-forward people what they're teaching their kids and curiosity is one of the main things people talk a lot about. Just like, "Help them develop curiosity about the world."

Molly Graham (00:38:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:31):
Yeah. Okay. I feel like I could be talking about this specific topic for a whole podcast episode, but I want to move on to a couple other frameworks that you've developed. One is something called a Waterline Model and another former colleague of here said, "This is the most impactful thing that they've learned from you on their career." So, talk about the Waterline Model.

Molly Graham (00:38:50):
Okay. Yeah. Well, first of all, the Waterline Model is not mine. It's from some business book somewhere, but I actually learned it. My first job out of college was leading wilderness trips. I led 75-day wilderness trips in Patagonia and Alaska for a school called NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School. NOLS basically teaches essentially leadership and communication skills to students.

(00:39:15):
I was mostly leading college age kids through wilderness expeditions. So, by having to lead a group of your peers that you don't know. Anyway, the Waterline Model is something that we taught on NOLS. It's a really, really helpful model for understanding how to diagnose when something is not working on a team, so I teach it inside of Glue Club and I'll just quickly explain it. Basically, the way to think about the Waterline Model is that a team is a boat and it's a boat on an ocean trying to get somewhere, getting somewhere is goals, right? "What are we trying to build or ship or do?" Essentially, that is going to be harder or easier based on whatever the shape of the ocean is, right? If it's really choppy, it's harder, if it's smooth and calm, it's going to be easy to get to your goals.

(00:40:02):
So, the Waterline basically asks the question like, "What is going on under the water? What is going on that's making it harder or easier to get to your goals?" And there's essentially four things underneath the water and they are in a descending order. The surface level is what's called structural things. Basically, structural things are like goal setting, vision, roles, expectations, kind of the structures you put in place to make a team and a company and a business make sense, that touch every single member of the team.

(00:40:37):
Right below that is something called dynamics, which is essentially how the team works together. It's culture, it's decision making, it's how we resolve conflict, all the sort of like interwoven pieces of how teams work together. And then below that is interpersonal, so basically relationships between two people and all the things that come with us being humans. And then the bottom is intrapersonal, meaning within one person, challenges and issues there.

(00:41:08):
The interesting thing about this model is that most people, when something's going wrong on a team, a lot of times we always go to the bottom. We go to the people. We're like, "The people aren't getting along, that person's having a rough moment." We go to the humans, but the rule with the Waterline Model, which is very memorable, is you snorkel before you scuba. So, 80% of problems on teams actually happen because of structural issues or dynamics issues. So, when there are problems on your team, where you start is at the top, you start structural issues.

(00:41:44):
And one of my biggest things that I say all the time over and over again inside of Glue Club is, "Your only goal as a manager, if you do nothing else, is clear roles and clear expectations. That's it." Because honestly, I've taken over a lot of teams in my life and almost always I show up and it turns out that no one knows what their job is and no one knows what success looks like. And if you can make those two things clear, which again is at the snorkel level, it will fix a huge percentage of other issues on a team. But the main thing is where you start and just always sort of starting at that structural level or the dynamics level and not sort of immediately going to the people and all that. Because yes, people cause all sorts of problems, but a lot of times the problems are happening because they're existing inside of a structure that's confusing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:32):
Another very vivid metaphor and just, I love how it builds on it with the snorkeling. Okay. So, just to be super clear about this, the takeaway here is, you have a problem with your team, with the company, many people think it's, they jump to the people are the problem. "They're not good enough, they're not working hard enough." Really, what you're saying is, most often, the issue is not the person, it's the situation, whether it's the structure of how they're set up to work or the dynamics amongst the people. And specifically what you're saying is that the role maybe isn't clear or what success means for that role is not clear.

Molly Graham (00:43:08):
Every company I've worked with or advise, I often start with like, "What are the goals?" And usually what you get the hack is, "Uh, not clear." And that in and of itself is a structural issue, right? How can someone show up and decide what they're going to do with their day all day if the goals aren't clear, if they don't actually know what the priorities are? And then it goes to, okay, role, right? "Do I know what my job is? Do I know what number I was hired to own and drive?" And then, "Do I know what success looks like? How does my role tie to that overall goal that the company has?" Just literally right there. You got probably 80% of problems inside of companies because this is the hard work of company building. It's the stuff that's not intuitive. "How do you organize a group of people to know which direction to row?"

(00:43:52):
And that equation, again, I would say 80% of problems that I see, performance issues. I always start with, "Does this person actually know what you expect of them?" If not, go back to step one. Do you know what I mean? Clarify expectations, so the Waterline Model is just helpful for reminding us, like, "Start at the top."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):
So what would you do there? Say you're a manager, you're having an issue with a team member, would you go and ask, "Hey, let's just make sure we're aligned on goals and roles." Is that how'd you approach it or is there a different approach?

Molly Graham (00:44:24):
So a lot of times what I do is two-sided, right? So it's like, "Hey, here's what I'm seeing and tell me what's going on for you. Do you know X, Y, Z?" When I take over a team, when I'm doing my listening tour, part of what I'm asking is, "What do you think your job is? What number were you hired to drive?" Because what you'll find is often their picture is different than your picture. You think you've been clear, you described an elephant and they spat out a tiger and that coming back to like, "Okay, no, we're building an elephant. You're in charge of the trunk." Will, in some percentage of cases, actually make a huge difference to the person's work and time and performance. In plenty of cases it doesn't, but that's always where I would start because it so often is just a more fundamental problem that then would lead you to look at other things across the team.

(00:45:20):
But yeah, I would say two-way dialogue, but re-clarifying roles and expectations, re-describing the elephant over and over and over again, is one of the hardest parts about being a leader because you feel like a broken record, right? You feel like an idiot. You're like, "I've said this 45 times." Turns out no one heard you the first 43 and you have to. You have to re-describe it in order for people to hear you and to re-understand their sort of role in what they're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):
I love how you reframed the way I approached it by starting with, "Here's what I'm seeing. What are you seeing? What do you think your role is? " The very non-violent communication oriented, which is a clear pattern on this podcast, just the power of that specific framework.

Molly Graham (00:45:58):
Yeah, totally. Well, like I said, work is about humans and it's...

Molly Graham (00:46:01):
Like I said, work is about humans and it's the art of organizing humans to get something done and build something that's greater than the sum of its parts and that is an art of the humanness in all of us, how do we get people to hear us, how do we get people aligned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:17):
Work for a lifetime.

Molly Graham (00:46:19):
Totally.

(00:47:17):
Okay, so let me actually follow this thread of the importance of goals and just being clear around this stuff. You have these six rules for creating clear goals and alignment on teams, talk about these six roles.

Molly Graham (00:47:30):
Yeah, totally. I feel like there should be less than six but it's where we're at. I would say, at a high level, two things before I get to the six. One is that I definitely have a bone to pick with OKRs, I feel like it's obviously been a really helpful framework for Google and others and, a lot of times, when I show up inside a company or I'm talking to a leader and I'm like, "What are your goals?" what I get back is this spreadsheet that has 100 lines and feels like it's written in Greek and, when I look at it, I'm like, " This doesn't create clarity for anyone." And it brings me back to what is the point of goals, why do we have them and, at the end of the day, goals are a communication tool, that's what they are. They're a communication tool designed to create clarity, to help people know I'm going to show up at my desk, what should I work on, what's the most important thing and your 100-line spreadsheet doesn't help anybody.

(00:48:23):
And the second thing I would just say is you really have to ask the question what is right for me at this company and this stage, what is right for a seed stage company is not what is right for a company that's got an established business and a clear go-to-market machine. So, when I'm building in seed stage, I'm setting goals every two months in a very iterative way. When I have an established business, I can actually set annual goals but annual goals for early stage companies is just a waste of time. So, anyway, a lot of my goal setting stuff actually comes from Facebook which I think was very, very good at this.

(00:48:58):
So, the first role is that no company needs more than three company goals and the point of company goals is to help people know what the most important things are to success. So, Facebook basically had three goals for the entire time I was there, it was five years and we did six-month goal setting, I think we did annual goal setting that ended up getting reset every six months but whatever. So, the three goals were this, there was growth which was measured as monthly active users, that was the externally reported number eventually, MAUs. The second goal was engagement meaning how often do people come back and use the site and the third was revenue and we literally had three goals for the five years that I was there. If you can govern that business with three goals, you can govern literally any business with three goals. So, no company needs more than three goals.

(00:49:52):
The second thing is that one goal needs to win in a fight. So, if I'm sitting down and asking how do I prioritize my time on a given day I need to know what is the most important thing. At Facebook, we had growth and there's a lot of different ways you can add monthly active users to a social media site including you can go buy a whole bunch of bots in Indonesia and that would add to your MAU number but it would not add to your engagement number and it was very clear for the entire time that I was there that engagement was the most important thing. Acquiring users that were going to use the site all the time, that's what drives revenue, it's also what drove the heart of that site. So, if you had to prioritize something, you prioritized engagement, that goal won in the fight.

(00:50:35):
The third I'll say is, I call it the explain it to me like I'm five goal, but an intern that started on Monday should be able to look at your goals and understand them and, if they can't, then you are failing because they are not a communication tool that's effective. You have to be able to understand the goals, you have to explain the acronyms, you have to have numbers that make sense to average people, otherwise, again, it fails as a communication tool.

(00:51:03):
The fourth one is ... Actually, I stole a phrase from Claire Hughes Johnson who you've had on your podcast but wrote a book called Scaling People and in it she says this sentence that I love which is strategy should hurt. And my role used to be set non-goals, basically, make it as clear what you're not going to do as what you are going to do but strategy should hurt is a much better way to explain it to people which is, if you're not making trade-offs that are painful, you are not actually helping people prioritize their time. Because the nature of work is that people will show up every day and do something and either you are very clear with them about what the priorities are or they're going to prioritize for you because they're going to choose what they work on every day. And we see this so much with founders where they can't cut things off the list, they just have to have the 10 goals and I'm like, "Cool. Six of these goals are not going to get done so either you pick which four it is or other people are going to pick for you." So, strategy should hurt. If your goal setting process is not painful, then you're not prioritizing heavily enough.

(00:52:09):
Okay, ready? We're on number five. This is more of an organizational point but it's really important for the waterline model too which is that one goal has one owner. You have a number, that number has a name next to it. If you cannot do that work, you haven't done the most important work to actually make sure that these goals get accomplished. And it's organizational work and it's very painful because sometimes it feels like, oh, this person can own it or this, maybe they'll just own it together, two people owning a goal is no one owning a goal. One person owns the goal, who is it? It's not you as the CEO, it's someone that works for you so one goal, one owner. And then the last, which is the hardest, is that goals by themselves are not enough. I've spent a lot of time with founders that are like, "I did it. I set the goals. Why not working? I don't understand." And I'm like, "What did you do after you set the goals?" And they're like, "I don't know, I set the goals." Goals ...

(00:53:10):
James Clear who wrote Atomic Habits has this really lovely sentence which is winners and losers have the same goal. Goals by themself are not enough, you have to have a process by which you follow up on the goals and you hold people accountable to the goals and you learn from the goals because so much of goal setting, particularly if you're earlier in building your company, is about learning from trying to do something. You set a goal, can we do it, how hard is it to move this number, that is the ... You might be wrong all the time but you're learning what it takes to move the number. So, setting the goal by itself, not enough, you have to build a process in the system to actually learn from the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:53):
Wow. This list is ... There's so much power in this list, it's such a succinct-

Molly Graham (00:53:57):
It's too long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):
No, I don't think it is because each of these has so much depth and power to them that saves you so much headache and just wasted time and resources. Just the idea of one owner, one goal, something I've personally discovered to have such power because, and correct me if I'm missing something here but just, if you feel like someone else may be doing the thing or feels like it's not just fully your responsibility, there's so much less energy and just mental ... I don't know. You just don't care as much about hitting that goal. And if it's you-

Molly Graham (00:54:29):
Yeah, accountability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:30):
Yeah. If it's like, "Lenny, this goal is your goal and, if you hit it, you've done it. If you don't, you've done a bad job," that'd be a such motivating, so motivating. If it's me and Molly, okay, well, we'll figure it out.

Molly Graham (00:54:41):
It creates a flood of clarity that seeps down from the person too. And to go back to the waterline model, I would say, so often you'll actually find companies that have set goals but no one owns the goals, everyone owns the goals, multiple people own the goal and you didn't actually get all the way to the answer. And I will say that the ownership thing is hard, it can feel painful but it's really important. There's only one owner and that means that that person, come hell or high water, owns that number.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):
Yeah. The way I described it [inaudible 00:55:18] was just someone's ass has to be on the line for this and that just works. That's such a powerful lever to drive things to have one person responsible.

Molly Graham (00:55:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:29):
The other's just this idea of strategy hurting, I love that. I love that phrase, I forgot Claire had that. So true.

Molly Graham (00:55:36):
So good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:37):
Because the whole idea is you need to not do things, you need to decide what you're not ... The whole strategy, a big part of it is what we are not doing.

Molly Graham (00:55:44):
Yeah, absolutely. And if you're not making painful choices, then you're not actually doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):
And this idea of three goals, so is it just ... So, do you go into a company and just go through a checklist essentially of here's the six things I look at to tell me where there's opportunity to improve?

Molly Graham (00:55:58):
When I work with founders and I see their goals, I use it as a way to get to know the business and I'm just going to be literally like, "What is this? What are you trying to explain?" And I can usually, through asking a lot of really dumb questions which, like I said, one of my superpowers, get them to explain to me the one sentence and the one number that they're actually trying to get across but it takes work and that's part of ... It's almost easier to write the 100-line spreadsheet than it is to say, "Wait, what are the three drivers of this business genuinely? What are they and how do they relate to each other?" And there can be things underneath them but there's three at the top that matter. So, yeah, I'm not a scientific person about it but a lot of it is just by asking people to explain their businesses to me, you can basically find the drivers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
And the story about Facebook having these same three goals for five years, considering their success, you may think they're not as complicated as your business but I am confident they're just as, if not, more complicated. They're a marketplace, a social network, they're a ad business, just they're ... There's a lot going on and, if they can work with three goals, you can do that too. And to your point, if it's not hurting, then you're doing something wrong.

Molly Graham (00:57:17):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:18):
I love how ... This is very much what I wanted this chat to be. It feels like every little segment is its own, could be its own podcast where we could talk about this for hours so I'm really excited how this is going. Moving on to another topic, you have not necessarily rules but rules of thumb that you find really helpful for people to have in their head as they're dealing with change and scale and growth and all that kind of stuff so let's just walk through that.

Molly Graham (00:57:45):
Yeah. So, for leaders that are leading through change and growth, the list is probably long but I always say to people don't come to me for management 101, I'm not the person to ask on how to run the most effective one-on-one with your people. What I think is not talked about enough is what it takes to manage and lead through change and that is a very particular set of feelings. And the first thing I learned, when someone makes you a manager or when you take a job as a leader inside a company, you really do feel like, "Oh, who gave me this job?" and you feel like you're supposed to know the answer to things. People come to you and ask questions and you're like, "I'm supposed to know. I'm a leader, I am supposed to have answers."

(00:58:35):
And I think, particularly inside of rapid change and scale and growth, it's really important to understand that your job as manager and a leader is not to have all the answers. It is not to have all the answers, it is to get good at finding them, it is to get good at bringing people together to find the answers. And that is hard because it requires saying, "I don't know, let's go figure it out," a whole bunch and it's scary as a leader to say I don't know because you think, "Oh, gosh, people are going to see through me." But again, the more you travel in life, the more you realize that the most experienced leaders are the ones that say, "No, no, no," all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:13):
I think this is a good reminder of this Bob the monster concept because, hearing this, okay, I don't need to have all the answers as a leader. In real life, being in a meeting, people are like, "Hey, Molly, what do you think of this?" You're like, "Oh, I should have a good answer." And so, I think that's a good reminder of this idea of this Bob the monster is going to tell you, "Oh, you don't know anything, you're not ready for this. You suck at this, you're going to fail everyone that's [inaudible 00:59:34]."

Molly Graham (00:59:33):
They're regretting hiring you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:35):
Yeah, exactly.

Molly Graham (00:59:36):
Everyone's going to see through you. Imposter, imposter, imposter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
Yeah, yeah.

Molly Graham (00:59:39):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
But just remembering, there's going to be this part of your head and that's okay, it's there but it doesn't mean it's true.

Molly Graham (00:59:44):
Absolutely. And these things are muscles. Dealing with Bob as a muscle, learning to not react to all those things that attack you but also learning, oh, in this moment when someone asks me a question and I'm like, "Oh," actually I should be like, "I don't actually know, let's go ... Who should we ask? How can we learn this? How can we explore this together? What do you think?" Those are all actually very powerful questions and they're terrifying to, particularly earlier in your career, as a leader and a manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:11):
Awesome. So, yeah, so the lesson there is no one expects you to have all the answers as a leader.

Molly Graham (01:00:15):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Awesome.

Molly Graham (01:00:17):
And particularly in this world, the one that's changing as fast as it is, nobody knows. Nobody knows what the answers are in a lot of cases, the war will be won by the people that are good exploring and figuring it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):
I love that phrase.

Molly Graham (01:00:31):
So, the second one is, and everyone that has learned this has learned it the hard way, do not promise things that you can't control. It's so tempting particularly when you're hiring people to be like, "Oh, yeah, your onboarding will be smooth and calm and everything's clear and we've figured it ... Let us tell you our vision and how obvious and clear and smart and blah, blah, blah." And then they show up and it's like, "Oh, shit," you know what I mean? There's no manual, no one knows what they're doing, it's all ambiguity and chaos. It's so easy when someone says I want to know that I'm going to be your CMO forever to be like, "Sure, you can be my CMO," you don't know that. Do you know what I mean? So, being really careful with promises of things that are out of your control like stability or titles or never hiring over someone is a flashing red light because there is literally no faster way to demoralize high performers than going back on a promise. Everyone that has been through it knows that feeling of like, "They told me this when I joined," and then they don't do it and you're like, "Well, fuck this place." So, no faster way to demoralize people or to hire the wrong people than promising things that are actually out of your control. Being honest and upfront about who you are as a company, about what you're able to promise, all of that is actually ... It's very hard work but it's so important because so much is out of your control and you need to hire people that are cool with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):
Love that. I learned this the hard way once, I had a ... One of my early projects, we were late and the head of product was just so pissed he's like, "Because I've been telling the CEO it's going to be on time because you've been telling me it's going to be on time and then it wasn't and why didn't you tell me that?" And I was just like, "Okay, it'll never happen again," and he's like, "You can't ... Don't tell me that because that's not true, that nay not ... You can't guarantee that." And so, that taught me that lesson of just, yeah, you're right, you want to say that, it feels so good. Okay, this will never happen again but you can't and they know you can't promise things like that.

Molly Graham (01:02:38):
Yeah. And sorry, I'm going to quote Claire Hughes Johnson again but she has this really fun phrase that she said in a talk at Glue Club that I've now latched onto and stolen from her which is, she was like, "Promises like that are like letter bombs that you mail yourself that are going to explode in your face in a year," and I was like, "That is the perfect metaphor." Because it's short-term pain, you want to make this person feel good right now so you promise them something but, in one year, you're going to make them feel terrible so don't do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
Great advice. All right, keep going.

Molly Graham (01:03:11):
Yeah. So, again, could probably go on the topic of what it takes to manage and lead forever inside this stuff but I'll give you two more that I yell about a lot in Glue Club. The first is that we spend huge amounts of time talking about hiring. How do you get good at hiring? What's the right interview? How do I find the right people? Firing people is as important as hiring people. Getting good at identifying when someone does not belong or someone is not going to work out is actually a skill and being good at it as a company and as a leader is as important as identifying the right talent because, eventually, if you're not good at firing people, what you have is essentially barnacles on a ship. Really going forward with the ship metaphor, anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):
It's true.

Molly Graham (01:04:00):
It's drag people that are sitting around not pushing the team forward. So, it's painful and it's horrible because it is humans but, when someone doesn't fit, you ... No one is right all the time when it comes to hiring, I actually say most people are wrong half the time. The best people in the world in hiring will tell you they have about a 50% average in terms of being right. That means half the hires don't work out. That means, half the time, you're going to need to fire the person. So, it's such an important skill to get good at particularly when you're going through a lot of change. And the last one is humans are messy and it's very emotional. And when you're a leader, particularly if you have any kind of anagram too or just if you like to make people happy and you want to be liked, it can be so hard to lead teams because you get tangled in the people. Firing people is a painful experience, reorganizing things, layering people, all these things are emotionally painful for the people and they're emotionally painful for you as a manager.

(01:05:05):
But my mantra that almost always leads in the best direction is serve the business, not the people meaning everyone is better off if this company is wildly successful. Everyone looks smart and makes lots of money or whatever if this company grows and does what we all dream it can. So, at the end of the day, the best decisions, the ones that are always going to be right are the ones that are like, "How do we do the right thing for this business?" And it also helps in political situations. Someone's acting weird or their Bob is raging all over the company, technically, everyone has the same goal. The goal is to build the biggest business possible, that's the answer. The answer is always what's the right thing for the business. And the people stuff can fall away when you actually focus on what's the right thing for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):
A really useful tool to do that that I learned from my manager is to think about, when you're trying to decide whether to fire someone or change a project even though it's going to upset someone, is to say, "Okay, if there were no emotions involved, if this person had no negative reaction to this, what would I do?"

Molly Graham (01:06:15):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:16):
And then that's the thing you should do and then you just do it. And then the question is how do I communicate this to them where their pain is lowest essentially.

Molly Graham (01:06:16):
In the kindest way possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):
In the kindest way possible. And because, to your point, if you optimize for the other thing of making people feel good, everything just falls apart, they're going to suffer even more down the road.

Molly Graham (01:06:38):
Yeah, absolutely. Direct is kind. And it feels kind or, really, honestly, easy to avoid these things or to work around them or to not but, at the end of the day, it's basically just a drag, the barnacle thing. It drags on your company, on your time, on your energy, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:58):
Yeah. But again, very hard to do in real life to do the thing that's hard and cause someone to be sad and upset and frustrated and maybe leave.

Molly Graham (01:07:08):
It is so hard and all these things are muscles, you get better at ... They don't become easy, it's not like anybody who's like, "Oh, it's so ... I enjoy firing people," no, but you recognize it faster and you are like, "Oh, I need to go do this." And that is actually ... It's a practice and something that you need to practice to become the kind of leader that leads these long-enduring companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:32):
Yeah. And this tool of thinking, asking what would I do if there were no emotions involved and this person wouldn't be upset, it helps you realize, okay, I see, this actually doesn't make sense to just do it the easy way right now because it doesn't make sense.

Molly Graham (01:07:46):
Yeah, it strips away. It strips away the emotions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:50):
Something else I wanted to make sure we spent a little time on is you have another tidbit along these lines which is around putting most of your energy into high performers versus spending all your time people that need help, talk about that.

Molly Graham (01:08:02):
As a leader, as a manager, you're running these teams and someone's struggling and it's very easy to get dragged into that and to end up spending a huge amount of energy on it but high performers are actually the future of your company. And if you think about it and if you've spent time on it, those are the folks where, if you invest your time and energy in them, you're going to get the 10x return that people talk about all the time in Silicon Valley. But what I've witnessed is that most people have a high performer and they just leave them alone, they're like, "That person's doing well so I'm just going to let them do their thing." And what I do when I have a high performer that's my favorite thing in the world is invest time and energy in them and basically build a whole system of working with them that is designed to draw out potential. And I would say there's two things here, one is it's really important to realize that our tendency-

Molly Graham (01:09:00):
There's two things here. One is it's really important to realize that our tendency is to actually spend time on low performers and it is not a good use of your time. See the point about firing people. But the other thing is that actively investing in and developing high performers is something that's important to get good at as a leader because that is how you create these little rocket ships that end up... You'll manage someone who's just like a project manager and all of a sudden they're running a whole function inside the company eventually, but it's because you took time and energy to invest in them. And my basic way of doing that, not to... I could spend a long time on this, but I would just say is I run experiments. I basically develop a theory about someone, "I think this person is capable of this kind of thing." And then piece by piece, it doesn't have to be a whole job or whole project. It can just be an incremental experiment, "I'm going to see if they can do this with less guidance or support from me."

(01:09:52):
I'm going to give them a bigger project. I'm going to give them something with more visibility. I'm going to manage them less, oversee them less, whatever. All of those are experiments to basically test your theory and deepen your theory in terms of this person's potential and their ability to help the company. And you're basically, for me, what I'm doing is deeply getting to know that person and then trying to pair them with company needs. What do we need? This person is great at zebra farming. Where do we need zebra farming? So how do I get them working on bigger and bigger and more and more critical things?

(01:10:27):
And to be honest, this is what people have done for me. At Facebook in particular, I've benefited from people being like, "Ooh, come help me with this thing." They saw potential in me and they asked me to help with something and it unlocked a huge amount for me. And so, it is such a powerful tool for getting more out of people that might be a little bit stuck if you leave them in this box. But if you start to expand the box, you can really unlock people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
So speaking of high performers, you've worked with many very high performing founder-CEOs. He worked really closely with Zuck, with Cheryl Sandberg, with Larry and Sergei at Google, with Brett Taylor, who I just... Just like you trying to read his resume, it takes three lines of things he's done over the course of his career. And so I just want to spend a little time on what are some things you've learned, maybe a few things you've learned from them, that group that you find yourself sharing with other people most.

Molly Graham (01:11:26):
That list is very long, but I'll give you a couple. The first one that I think is kind of counterintuitive is... So I said I worked at Facebook. I worked on culture, which is one of those words that doesn't really mean anything. So I define it as the way we do things around here. And I thought my job was to shape the culture. I thought it was to push the culture. And the most humbling lesson I learned is 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Facebook is Mark. Google is Larry and Sergei. Google, when I was there, it felt like a university. It's where ideas are more important in a lot of ways than what's shipped. And there's a campus and they basically wanted people to live there when I was there. It was designed to basically be a two PhD students' paradise.

(01:12:29):
Facebook felt like a 19-year-old hacker's dorm room when I was there. And it was shipping above all and all else. And it seeped with Mark's DNA. And I spent ages trying to create various changes inside the company or trying to push a point. And Mark would say literally one thing in an all hands, and it was like somebody threw a boulder into the pond. So our job as operators or as leaders around founders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating and to help extend it. My version of founder mode, which I know you've spent some time on on this podcast is your job is to build a company that would make a decision the way the founder would when they're not in the room. That is the work of building a company around a founder, but your job is not to shape culture.

(01:13:24):
That is mostly defined by the literal personality strengths and weaknesses of the person at the top. And that's been true of Mark and it's been true of Brett. Everywhere I go, that's who it is. You don't need a consulting firm to tell you, just go do a personality diagnosis on your founder. And the weaknesses thing is real. I've seen and watched friends try to shape a set of values at a company and it just doesn't match who the founder is. You say, "Move fast and break things," or whatever your version of that is. And your founder loves ambiguity and is perfectly happy with not making decisions. All that leads to is cultural dissonance. It leads to people being like, "Wait, what? I thought we said we care about moving fast and making aggressive decisions and it turns out..." So being really careful about what you say, because what people actually feel when it comes to culture is what you do and how you act every day.

(01:14:18):
You can never write anything down and you will still have a culture. It will be created through the actions and the decisions that you make and that your founder makes. So that would be a huge one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
Let me spend a little more time on this because this is so good. So all this advice on culture and it feels so true based on everything I've seen. So tip one there is just you can't really change the culture. Maybe there's a little bit on the edges you could adjust. It will come down and trickle down from the founder, CEO probably mostly, but just the founders in general.

Molly Graham (01:14:49):
And founder-CEO is probably the single biggest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
Founder-CEO.

Molly Graham (01:14:52):
Co-founders, it depends a lot on the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):
Awesome.

Molly Graham (01:14:57):
I think Stripe is probably very much like Patrick and John, but it's not every co-founder that has that level of power [inaudible 01:15:03].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:03):
Awesome. And then the way you describe culture, I think it's the way Seth Godin talks about it too, who's also been on the podcast. How cool is that?

Molly Graham (01:15:09):
So cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:10):
He said, "Culture is..." And what you said, "Culture is the way we do things around here. That's what culture is, is how we..." That's how people describe your culture is, "The way we do things around here."

Molly Graham (01:15:22):
I ran culture, whatever the hell that means, at Facebook for a hot second. I literally haven't done a values exercise since. And it sounds crazy, right? Because in theory, I know how to do this stuff. I don't really know how to do this stuff. But for me, the point is process and systems and how do we make decisions? That's where culture actually lives. It is what you do. It's how you hire. It's how you fire. It's who you don't hire. It's all of those decisions. That is culture. So whenever I'm working with a company or building a company, that's what I'm focused on, not on what's the shiny word that we're putting on the wall. You know what I mean?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
Yeah. So the way you're describing is, as you said, it's what you do. It's not what you say?

Molly Graham (01:15:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):
Awesome. Keep going.

Molly Graham (01:16:04):
I'll give you two more that are helpful. This one is a Mark Zuckerberg classic, but he has this very strong feeling that people don't escalate enough. And he was very adamant about it at Facebook. And he brought it to CZI too where he was like, "Escalation is a tool." And he's like, "People get stuck. They get stuck with two people with equal power trying to solve a problem. You can spend so much time bashing heads, going back and forth. And actually what you just need to do is go up. You need to go." The problem is that we think of escalation as, "I'm A and B and I are disagreeing. And so, I'm going to go up to C and tell on B. I'm going to go tattle to the teacher." That is not what escalation is. What escalation is, "We disagree. Neither one of us has enough power to make this decision. Let's go to someone who does." My boss, my boss's boss, whoever it is.

(01:16:59):
As soon as you are stuck, escalate. Go together, go make your case to whoever it is, go together up. That is unlocking. It's saving you a whole bunch of time. And it's something that I've found as I've worked with companies and leaders in Glue Club. It's not a muscle that's very comfortable for people, but it's so smart. And Mark has a lot of these, but that one I really took away because again, I think so many people think of escalation as bad, a failure, like, "I failed, so I had to escalate." No, it's a tool. It's what management is for. They're there to unblock you. Let them unblock you. Stop arguing over something you can't decide.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:36):
And they'll be so happy knowing you did not waste a week debating this and then just arguing and just looking at data. It's like, "Okay, I can just tell you exactly what we should do. Let's go do that."

Molly Graham (01:17:44):
Exactly. You lack context or you lack power. And then the last one actually is from Cheryl Sandberg, who I learned an enormous amount from, huge, was like going to business school without going to business school working with her. But I say it a lot right now, so I'm going to say it on your podcast so maybe some people will hear me. Growing more than 100% every year is a bad idea. The happiest growth rate is 50%, 100% is manageable. Anything more than doubling and you are signing yourself up for a world of pain. And I have seen this over and over and over again. I had to scream way louder about it five years ago than I do now because we've been through collectively a lot of pain and a lot of layoffs. And obviously the combination of 2021 and then AI has led us to talk about unit economics and scaling with tools, not people.

(01:18:47):
But I still see companies and I'm still talking to founders that are like, "Yeah, we're 50 people and we're going to be 150 people next year." And I'm like, "Could you possibly do that with 100 people?" But here's what basically happens if you grow at more than 100%, which is you're growing too fast to de-dupe all the issues. So somebody posts this role, it actually turns out that that role is also being hired for on this other team. So you're hiring two people who more or less have the same job description and are assigned to the same number or the same problem, but nobody talked to each other. And those two people both show up and they're like, "I am doing this." And the person's like, "Wait, I thought I was doing that." Anyway, so then you've got all this... And think about all the time and all the energy and all the money that goes into de-duping that.

(01:19:32):
If you slow down, if you hire for quality and for real need versus the panic hiring, whatever your sales model spits out or whatever, you'll actually find leverage. You find, "Oh, I didn't need that person," or, "I didn't need this whole team," or, "I didn't need this whole function," or, "I can wait for that." So slow down. And again, these are all just guidelines in terms of the 50% is happy and 100% is manageable. But having seen enough of this, I can tell you these are good rules and you should pay attention to them. And sometimes you're like, "I have to double or I have to more than double or I have to triple," or whatever. I'm like, "Okay, just ask a whole lot of questions as you open roles. Ask a whole lot of questions as you hire because you will find duplication, you will find chaos coming in the front door."

(01:20:16):
More people does not actually make you faster. Do you know what I mean? We think it does. It does not. It makes it harder. It makes it harder to get work done. It makes it slower. So you should be scared of adding people, not like, "Oh, this is the answer to all my problems."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):
Amazing. And just to be clear, you're talking about the growth of the company. So doubling in a year, bad idea. It's possible, but you're saying it's going to be very hard and painful and probably a really bad idea.

Molly Graham (01:20:40):
Yeah. More than doubling head count growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):
More than doubling.

Molly Graham (01:20:40):
Great point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):
Head count?

Molly Graham (01:20:42):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):
Awesome. It's-

Molly Graham (01:20:44):
Please feel free to do whatever you want with your business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:47):
Just advice. This is top of mind because I just had the interview with Matt McGinnis, but so much of what he talked about is this resonates with what you're talking about. He talked a lot about under-resourcing your team-

Molly Graham (01:20:59):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:59):
Leads to much better outcomes because people don't work on the low priority stuff. They focus on only high priority stuff. And the other is this idea of escalating. He talked a lot about that. Just like, "Escalation is good. Tell me when there's something I can help with, please. I'm here waiting constantly-

Molly Graham (01:21:14):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:14):
"To help."

Molly Graham (01:21:14):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
Amazing. So maybe for a final question, one of your former colleagues, Eric Antonow, who's just this epic dude that few people know about-

Molly Graham (01:21:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:24):
That I've chatted with over the last few months because he knows so many people that come on this podcast. He's a former Facebook person, now at OpenAI. I asked him what I should ask you about and he told me something really insightful about you. He said that you had this really massive growth spurt at Facebook, which you shared and talked about. And then after you leaving, you had this huge ambition to become COO, CEO, become this huge big deal boss person, just take over the world. And then he noticed your ambitions significantly pivot to working on community building and helping people with their careers. And you turned down really big C-level role opportunities. And the way he described it is you were a dog that once thought you were cat. And the other metaphor he used is you change from AC current to DC current, which I don't know exactly what that means. So does this resonate? And if so, just what happened there?

Molly Graham (01:22:22):
Eric is actually better at metaphors than I am, and I regularly rip his metaphors. But yes, Eric Antonow, the least well-known, but most brilliant person in my life. So I gave a talk at a company recently and somebody asked the question, "What's something you've changed your mind about?" And I was like, "Woof." But I actually talked about this because... So my brain is developing this model that is not done yet, but it's basically this idea that everybody has a proving phase to their career where you're proving to yourself and probably to your parents and some other people that you're good at stuff. You're like, "I'm going to prove." And it's an important phase because you need to learn. All the stuff we talked about. You need to learn what you're good at. You need to learn that you are good at things and that people should hire you for things and what are those things?

(01:23:22):
But part of that phase is also doing what you think matters, what you think you should do. Family programming or career books tell you this is what you should do, titles and all that stuff. And then, I think everybody has a moment and I think this moment varies wildly in terms of when it hits people, where you hit some sort of wall or I don't know what it is, speed bump, something, and the world forces you to say, "Okay, I've proven myself and I'm good at this thing. What do I want to do with it?" And for me, I spent 10 or 15 years proving to myself and to others that I was really good at this thing, basically working with brilliant founders to help bring their vision to life, "That's what you should hire me to do." That's what I was known for.

(01:24:20):
And it turned out that that wasn't what I love doing anymore. And it was really, really hard to walk away from because there was a lot of shoulds. It was like, "You should take this job with this fancy title. People are going to think you're so cool." And you get to... I call it a LinkedIn crush where you're really excited to post the job on LinkedIn, but you're deeply unexcited about doing the job. So you have all these LinkedIn crushes and you're like... And I vividly remember this one job that I turned down where I had to go for many walks. And what I was repeating over and over again to myself was, "What does this get you that you don't already have? What does this get you that you don't already have?" And I think, for me, it was this realization that these things that fed me early in my career just didn't feed me anymore, that I didn't get joy and excitement out of doing these jobs anymore, and I wasn't scared.

(01:25:20):
So it led me actually on a very long, windy journey, a founder journey, even though I have trouble with that title, just like the influencer title, to figure out what I wanted to build. And what I would've told you I wanted to build three years ago is actually not what I'm doing today, but through a lot of really fun experiments and a journey that never ends, what I've discovered is that what I love doing is building safe spaces for leaders to learn and grow, but also to find sanity and connection in a world that's kind of insane, whether it's working in a startup or some other kind of insanity, but that feeds me and there's nothing I love more than that, and I could not have told you that three years ago, but, to Eric's point, it really took a lot of work to switch currents or switch myself from a dog to a cat or whatever his metaphor is. And I think it's the work of it's ongoing work, but it's that thing of what do I want versus what do I think people expect of me?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:32):
There's so much depth there. This could be another entire podcast conversation talking through this journey, but I'm going to close with a note from your partner, Sarah. She told me that she has this sticker on her notebook with three pieces of advice that you gave her when she started at OpenAI. Get to know your customer, they have the answer; be patient because everything is going to change; and just keep trying. So just as a final question, is there anything along those lines that you think might be helpful for people to hear or is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with?

Molly Graham (01:27:07):
Part of what I think is so important to realize inside of scaling and changing companies and the world is some things will always be true. And part of what I was saying to Sarah in the "get to know the customer, they have the answer" is, whatever bullshit is going on around you and whatever walls and ceiling are being rearranged this week, the customer is never going to change. That's a thing that will never change. And I think finding those immovable objects, those compasses in the face of a storm, which being inside of a scaling company in a startup feels like a tornado. And I think OpenAI is extra special on that front. You have to find these guiding lights that get you through that storm. And I think it's sort of the same thing as "Serve the business, not the people." What are the things that will always be true? We are here to do this. We are here to serve the customer.

(01:28:09):
And then the other piece of the three things that she wrote down is, I think that we, as humans, we seek stability. Our brains would like things to stop changing. We would like things to stay the same. And that is just not a reality inside of companies that are growing and changing as fast as OpenAI or a lot of the companies today that are being built. So actually, you need to start to expect instability. You need to start to just assume things are going to change. Assume you're going to have a new boss in six months. I talk about this a lot when I talk to folks at OpenAI, "You need to stop expecting that anything's going to be the same in six months or a year. You will have a different job. You will have a different boss."

(01:28:55):
How do you prepare for that? Do you know what I mean? How do you almost see the instability as stability because it's the only thing that is definitely going to be true. And part of that is to just keep going. You know what I mean? To just find these lights and these compasses or whatever metaphor sticks with you and focus on those because whatever is happening around you, you just got to keep moving forward and keep learning as much as you can because that's the real opportunity. Whatever happens to the company, however successful it is, all that you take away from it... I always say all that you take away from it is people that like working with you and want to work with you again and what you learned. That's it. You might hopefully take a bunch of money, but you might not. So people and what you learned, that's it. Focus on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):
It's all about the friends you made along the way. That old line is true. Oh, man. Molly, I feel like we've gone for so long and we've just scratched the surface. I'd love to have you back to go deeper on a lot of this stuff. I'm going to skip the lightning round because we've gone long and I want to keep people from having to listen to more. So I'm just going to end with, what should people know about what you're working on? Where can people go find you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Molly Graham (01:30:07):
You can find me on LinkedIn and you can find me on Substack. I have a Substack called Lessons that I'm slowly trying to turn into a community where we can talk about things, the real stuff. And you can find me at Glue Club, which, if you're a leader inside of one of these crazy companies that's changing all the time, we can be a great home for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:26):
What's the URL there just for folks to check out?

Molly Graham (01:30:27):
It's glueclub.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:28):
Glue, G-L-U-E?

Molly Graham (01:30:31):
G-L-U-E.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):
C-L-U-B.com. Great.

Molly Graham (01:30:34):
Yeah, exactly. And in terms of people, what people can do to be useful to me, I love helping leaders with problems. I really get a lot of energy out of unsticking people and helping people feel supported and seen and helping them grow. I do that through Glue Club. So if you're a leader that feels like you want some sanity and some support in the face of whatever tornado you're in, that's a great place to come. But the same is true of Substack. So if Glue Club isn't for you, come on over to Substack. I've opened up a bunch of channels to just talk about stuff, listen to people's problems, answer questions because I love helping people. And I think it's a complicated moment right now to be a leader and to figure out which way is up. So come on over.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:24):
Amazing. Molly, thank you so much for being here.

Molly Graham (01:31:27):

# How Palantir built the ultimate founder factory | Nabeel S. Qureshi (founder, writer, ex-Palantir)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
30% of PMs that leave Palantir start a company. Just give us a picture of what the people are like.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:05):
I feel like they screened really hard for a few traits in particular. One is like very independent-minded people who weren't afraid to push back. Two is people with broader intellectual interests.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
What's the difference between, say, a PM at Palantir versus a traditional PM?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:18):
They were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deployed engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way. There's two types of engineer at Palantir. So, there's one that works on the core product and they're a traditional software engineer. There was a different type of engineer which you sent into the field. You would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there and so, that engineer became known as a forward deployed engineer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
What's something that you believe that most other people don't?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:54):
I think this is a somewhat contrarian view within tech.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
Today, my guest is Nabeel Qureshi. Nabeel is a founder, a writer, a researcher, and an engineer. He was recently a visiting scholar researching AI policy at the Mercatus Center alongside Tyler Cowen. At one point, he worked with the National Institute of Health and major clinical centers to create the largest medical data set in the world. He worked at the Bank of England for a bit. He was founding member and VP of Business Development at GoCardless, one of Europe's biggest financial technology unicorns.

(00:01:23):
And most related to the topic of this conversation, Nabeel spent almost eight years at Palantir as a forward deployed engineer working on public health projects with US federal agencies, including public health services during the COVID-19 response and applied AI in drug discovery. Whether you are a fan of Palantir or hate everything that they do, they are an important and fast-growing company that is pumping out incredible product leaders, as you'll hear more than any other company in the world. So, it is worth studying and understanding.

(00:01:52):
I've never heard an in-depth conversation digging into how they operate, build product, hire, and were able to scale from a primarily services business to a software business. So, I am very excited to bring you this inside look. In our conversation, we go deep into what the heck does Palantir even do, why getting good at managing lots of data is an underappreciated secret to their success, a look at the unique forward deployed engineer role that they innovated, and what other companies can borrow from their insights here. Also, how they hire and how they build amazing product leaders, plus a ton of advice on talking to customers, building products, and starting companies.

Nabeel, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:05:12):
Thanks, Lenny. Glad to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):
In our chat today, I want to zero in on a post that you recently wrote where you shared your reflections on your time at Palantir. You spent something, maybe just under eight years there. The reason I'm really interested in Palantir is I've been doing a bunch of research recently looking into which companies hire the best product managers and create the best product managers, and Palantir just keeps coming up over and over in the work that I'm doing.

(00:05:37):
So, I'll share a few stats real quick. I looked at which companies produce the most founders, especially out of their PM team, and Palantir is, by far, number one. 30% of PMs that leave Palantir start a company. And number two is 18% and that's Intercom. So, that stat, I looked at which companies PMs that leave get immediately promoted in their next role, Palantir is number one of all companies in the world.

(00:06:02):
I looked at which companies' PMs become the first PM at another startup that they join, Palantir is number two in the world. And then I looked at which companies alumni PMs become heads of Product down later in their career, Palantir is number three in the world. Also, just the company is doing extremely well. It's worth, I think, something like $200 billion these days. So, there's a lot to learn from Palantir.

(00:06:27):
I actually want to start a question that I imagine every employee at Palantir constantly gets that, and I still don't think people totally have an answer in their head. What does Palantir do?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:06:38):
That's a great question. You started off with an easy one, Lenny. So, Palantir is, the way I describe it, is they achieve outcomes for their customers very tactically. The way they do that tends to be through a data platform. So, they have what I consider to be the world's best data platform, and I can go into what that means in a second. And then there's a couple of different versions of this. So, there's one that's optimized for intelligence and defense use cases that one is called Gotham. And then there's one that's more optimized for commercial use cases and that one's called Foundry.

(00:07:12):
And that's the classic explanation of what they do. So, they sell a data platform. They typically work with very large customers is the other thing. So, it's going to be Fortune 50. It's going to be governments around the world. It's going to be those kinds of customers. So, that's the capsule answer, but there's lots to unpack in there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:32):
Awesome. Okay, and we're going to touch on a lot of this stuff, including the data piece. I want to start with talking about just the people and the culture of Palantir. You shared a bunch of really funny stories of what it's like to come to work and even interview at Palantir. There's a story you shared where because maybe the co-founder, you're walking by and he's chewing ice, and that's some benefits to cognition. Just give us a picture of what the people are like, especially early days Palantir and the culture and how unique it might seem.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:07:58):
Yeah, it's definitely, it's an add-a-one company. I don't know how else you would start this company if you were not somebody like Peter Thiel. And so far as, it seems like there was a point at which they owned a silly fraction of the office space in Palo Alto. So, you'd walk around Palo Alto and there would just be Palantir hoodies, Palantir buildings everywhere and so on.

(00:08:21):
And so, I feel like what happened at some point is they raised a lot of money and they resorted to all these really interesting ways of just getting top talent out of places like Stanford and other top schools and just people who knew the founders who tended to be very interesting intellectual people. And I feel like they screened really hard for a few traits in particular. So, I would say one is very independent-minded people, people who weren't afraid to push back, who questioned the frame of everything and thought for themselves and had strong convictions.

(00:08:55):
Two is just people with broader intellectual interests. Karp just released a new book and he's quoting Habermas and all these European intellectuals and just things you don't typically see a tech CEO do. And so, I think there's that intellectual strand in the company. And then yeah, I think three is just people who are very intensely competitive. There's a sort of win at all costs mentality to the company. And so, I think those were the set of traits that were this gravity while in California at a certain time. And so, you just had a lot of really fascinating people joining the company at that time.

(00:09:33):
The way they screened for this was interesting too. So, for the longest time, they had... Everyone does this now, I think, but at the time, it was a little bit rarer, is a founder had to interview you in order for you to receive an offer. And so, a founder, it could have been Alex Karp, it could have been Stephen Cohen. Earlier on, it might have been somebody like Joe Lonsdale, but it was always one of these people.

(00:09:54):
And the interviews were pretty strange. With Stephen, it would be, you'd be chatting about philosophy for an hour and a half and it would very much just be like he would pick a topic out of thin air. It was impossible to prepare for, and then he would just go very, very deep and try and test the limits of your understanding. But it would really just be a fun conversation and then if you pass the vibe check, you'd be in. And so, there was that strong selection mechanism.

(00:10:20):
There was also the question of, I think it might have been Thiel who mentioned this, but he thinks that a lot of the best recruiters in the world or the companies that attract talent, they put out this distinctive bad signal and it has to turn some people off. That's the key of a good, bad signal. So, I think in the present day, OpenAI and Anthropic, they're both sucking up some of the best talent that you and I know. And I think one way they do do that, and they are sincere in this, but they do really attract people who are almost messianic about the potential of artificial super intelligence and who really believe this is the only thing that matters and it is going to be the biggest thing in the world.

(00:10:56):
I think Palantir's version of that was that they were quite focused on things like preserving the West. There was a slogan of Save the Shire, right? So, they were talking about military and defense and intelligence and the importance of that well before everybody else. And bear in mind, this was during the era when it was social, mobile, local apps. You had, social media was on the rise. You had, the hot companies were Facebook and Pinterest and things like that. And so, this was, at the time, a very strange thing.

(00:11:26):
And so, I think to be drawn to that, you had to look at the other options and say, "Well, this is fine, but what am I really doing in life?" Whereas you had this other place that was like, "Hey, come solve the hardest, messiest problems in the world with us." And I think just at that time, that really drew some really good people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):
We're going to talk about the reasons people don't necessarily like Palantir and the moral question of what they do, but when people look at a company that is like... I guess OpenAI, to your point, is a good example where they're just so turned off by maybe their approach. What you're missing is that's potentially intentional because it actually draws in the people they really want.

(00:12:03):
It makes me think about, I was involved in creating the core values at Airbnb and something that we learned at going through that process is, when you define the values for your company, it's really important to clarify who this is not for, exactly as you described, which feels unnatural. Like, "Oh, we want to be inclusive, we don't want to make people feel like they don't belong." But the whole idea is to be clear on here's who will thrive here and here's who's aligned with our mission. And what I'm hearing is Palantir and these companies take it to the extreme.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:12:30):
A hundred percent, yeah. On my team at Palantir, one process that we followed, I could talk about this more if it's interesting, is when you started a new project, you basically had to organize what they called a murder board for it. I think this is originally an army type. So, the idea is, basically, you write up a two-page plan for the project. You invite three or four smart folks who don't know anything about the project and their job is just to tear apart your plan.

(00:12:56):
And so, you have to write, here's the vision for this, here are the goals, here are the tactics over the next three months. And one section was principles that you're following for this project. And I remember giving this advice a lot was just like when people joined, they would write principles such as move fast and I would always be, "Everyone likes to move fast." It is not a good principle actually because nobody can really disagree with this reasonably. You need something that actually a lot of people are going to go, "Why are you taking this principle? This seems wrong to me." So, you need something that people can disagree with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
I want to come back to the beginning of what you described of what they look for, what Palantir looks for in people. You talked about independent-minded, a lot of interests, broad interests, and competitive. First of all, I think a lot of people hearing that, especially the last part, be like, "I don't want to work there." Why does this work? Because this isn't naturally what you would think of as how you build the most amazing, productive team.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:13:52):
I think it just draws people who want to win. I think that's what was really important. The other piece of it, I think, is that there's actually, and this was much truer 10 years ago, is there was a lot of talent that was a little bit outside of the tech ecosystem but could easily have been very successful within it. So, people who got out of the military or one of the intelligence agencies and they were doing, let's say, an MBA somewhere to transition into the corporate world. And I think, typically, they would have taken a position at a classic Fortune 500 corporation. And actually, Palantir managed to get a bunch of that talent. And at the time, that was very undervalued.

(00:14:32):
The people who succeed the most in the Marines or the Special Forces or whatever it is, tend to be pretty smart people. They tend to have accomplished very difficult goals in very hostile environments. And it turns out that when you're starting a somewhat chaotic tech company, that's actually a very useful skill to have. Again, I think more companies are doing this now, so Scale AI and et cetera. But at the time, that was a very differentiated talent pool.

(00:14:57):
And so, I think having those values as opposed to maybe the values that were more in fashion then, so talking about how inclusive you are, or the sushi that you serve at lunch, or whatever it is, it just drew a very different crowd. And I think the game that was being played there was, one, it's mission alignment. You're doing a defense company, that's the kind of person you want to attract. But I think there's also, two, which is just what is the talent that maybe is a little bit undervalued now and how do you actually draw those people to you? And I think that game is always shifting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):
This is definitely starting to explain why so many Palantir alumni go on to start companies and become leaders at other companies. These are leaders that you're hiring. So, it feels like a lot of it is just the talent you hire are people that are naturally leaders.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:15:45):
I think you're right, and we can get more into it, but I think there was also a very concrete set of ways where that place was a training ground for founders. I even think it turned a lot of people who might not have become founders into good founders because of the way it works. So, I think there was a selection effect there, but there is also some training effect too, but it's unique to the way the company works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:08):
And is that along the lines of the forward deployed engineer stuff or is that something else?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:16:11):
It is that, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:12):
Okay, cool. We're going to get to that. I love it. Okay, amazing. Before we do that, one last thing is something I've seen is that you guys at Palantir don't really have titles. Everyone's the same level and just generic titles for everyone. Talk about that. Why do you think that was important? Why was that useful?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:16:29):
I don't know this for sure, but I do know that Thiel writes about this in Zero to One and his take is just that as soon as we have these title, you have a thing that people are competing for and then you get these very unproductive conflicts. You get people optimizing to game the system. You get Goodhart's law everywhere. So, it's like you have a metric and then people basically manage to the metrics.

(00:16:50):
I don't want to pick on any one company, but if you take Google, for example, there's a lot of interesting posts by people who left Google and they cite this as a reason why they got a little bit disgruntled, is that there's a way to get promoted. Rather than, let's say, improving an existing product, what you do is you start a completely new product and that has your name attached to it. And then when it comes to promotion season, you could say, "Hey, I did this new thing." And then boom, you have a new Google product, but it's maybe confusing to the end user.

(00:17:15):
So, I think they wanted to avoid all these kinds of dynamics. And so, the way that they did that was they said, "Well, titles are not going to be this memetic totem that everybody competes for. Instead, everyone is just going to have the same slightly meaningless title, which is forward deployed engineer." And the only people who did have titles were the CEO and then there were six directors and that was it. And now, I think it's a little bit more nuanced. There are different teams. There are some people with titles, but honestly, it was almost like...

(00:17:45):
We used to joke about it. It's like people would leave the company and then you'd see them update their LinkedIn and they would be like, "Oh yeah, I was totally the SVP of XYZ." And it's like, "No, you weren't. You're just..." But then it's like I totally understand it too because when you leave the company, you have to make your experience legible to the next person. And so, guess what? Things like SVP actually do matter.

(00:18:08):
And so, yeah, I think they wanted to avoid this intel competition. There are downsides to doing this. So, maybe the competition isn't as explicit around a specific title, but instead, what it becomes about is there's a particular exact or something and you want to gain that favor. And so, it becomes more about who can get in the inner circle of this person or whatever. And there were those dynamics too.

(00:18:32):
I actually am a big fan of this philosophy though, the no titles one. I think what it did do is that it basically said if you are in, let's say you're in a role of you're leading a very important project, which could happen, what it said was... This is always fluid. So, you are in this role because you're very good and so, it's a meritocratic thing. But if you start performing well, it's actually very easy to shift that because there is no explicit " I am the GM of this project title." And so, you always had to earn your place in the company. You always had to earn the right to work on what you were working on, and I think that was a good side effect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:12):
Let's start talking about forward deployed engineers. What is a forward deployed engineer?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:19:17):
So, the way this originated was, basically, you can think of it as there's two types of engineer at Palantir. So, there's one that works on the core products. So, they don't necessarily leave the building in Palo Alto or New York or the offices. They're very much working on the core products and they're a traditional software engineer.

(00:19:35):
Because of the way the company works where you had these very large engagements with these large entities, there was a different type of engineer which you sent into the field. So, what that meant was you would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there. And so, that engineer became known as a forward deployed engineer.

(00:19:55):
So, within the company, that function is known as business development or BD. And then PD is product development. So, it's where the product is made. And so, within BD, you had forward deployed engineers. There are actually two types. So, there is one that it's a more technical software engineer. So, you have to pass a software engineering interview and prove your chops there and you would typically have a CS degree, but there was actually a type of forward deployed engineer that didn't have that. So, you would still get a technical interview, but it would be less about, do you know the specifics of this C++ algorithm? And it would be more about just like can you reason about data? We didn't have that division originally, but it turns out that there's a lot of people who are technical adjacent, shall we say, who you really need in the room when you're working with these large organizations or these large companies, because translating what you're doing into language that would resonate with an executive or being able to navigate the social dynamics in a room, all these are very valuable skills. And so, the hiring criteria there were a little different. It was a bit more about, are you savvy as a human? But all of that was given the title of forward deployed engineer, and it's just an engineer who works with customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
Okay, so just to make this crystal clear for people, a lot of people hear this idea of Palantir having forward deployed engineers. A few other companies have done this. It's pretty radical. So, as you described, you basically have a desk at a company. So, you worked with Airbus and we'll talk about that. So, let's just make it real. So, you have a desk and a computer and login access and all these things at Airbus. You go to their office four times a week. You're sitting there with their employees working side by side, building a product for them, versus what most people do where "they just talk to customers," where they do an interview once in a while, they do a Zoom, they share mocks, things like that. This is like that on steroids. Is that roughly the way to think about it?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:21:51):
It is, yeah. And so, we would really be there a lot of the time. And so, the side effect of that was, one, you learn to live and breathe the customer's problems and you learn to speak their language. And eventually, they saw you as one of them and so, you develop these really close bonds with the customers. So, at Airbus, I would be at the factory where the planes were produced, or I'd be sitting next to people diagnosing issues with aircraft or whatever it was. Similarly, later on, I worked with the NIH, which was part of the US government, and I actually had a badge there and I would work with civil servants and biologists and clinicians and people who were working there.

(00:22:31):
And so, it's this pretty radical thing as you suggest. I think the key thing there from a business point of view is the average deal that Palantir had was very large in the many, many millions of dollars, which means that you could pay for this as part of the thing that the customer got. And then it was priced according to the value that the customer got.

(00:22:51):
So, as a simple example, if you're Airbus and let's say that you have an issue with one of your planes and you need to fix it, and fixing that is worth a $100 million or something to you, that's how it would be priced. It would not be priced as, "Hey, you're buying data infrastructure and it's similar to Snowflake or Databricks or one of these other providers. It's much more anchored to, here is the outcome.

(00:23:15):
But then the job of the forward deployed engineer is not just to deploy software. It is not just to sell software. It is to actually solve the problem. And so, you would have to be there. You would have to meet the key stakeholders who are actually in charge of reporting to the CEO about the specific issue. You would have to become their friend. You would have to gain their trust. And you would have to, in some cases, create new software such that it could actually solve the novel problem that was in front of you.

(00:23:41):
So, I would have friends who worked with one of our energy company customers and they would have to learn the ins and outs of how oil wells work. And then out of that, it turns out that having streaming data is actually very valuable for this use case. And so, boom, suddenly, there's a product that can handle streaming data that becomes part of the core platform. But that would be the motion, is you learn about the problem. You figure out what software would best address it. You build that software. You use it to accomplish the goal. And then eventually, that gets folded into the broader product suite.

(00:24:13):
And so, you can start to see why this would be a good forge for founders. And this was actually part of my thesis going in and joining, was I said, "Well, say, I got five reps of this," which I got more than that. But say, you got five reps of doing this in five disparate contexts, you actually become very good at this cycle of, okay, go into the building, gain the trust of the person, meet the people that are going to become your users, talk to them about their problems, make sure you're building something that actually solves them, and it's just a boondoggle.

(00:24:43):
Get really fast feedback and iteration loops. So, every week, you would have a cadence where it's like Monday, you go in. You do your meetings. Monday night, you build something. Tuesday, you show it to somebody. Tuesday, you get the feedback. Tuesday night, you iterate on it. Wednesday, you show it to somebody. Wednesday night, you iterate on it. So, you get four of these, five of these cycles every single week.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:25:00):
It already got it. So you get four of these, five of these cycles every single week, and you're moving incredibly fast. So 6 weeks in, you've suddenly gotten to, wow, this is really valuable, and somebody's willing to pay you whatever, $20 million for it, and boom. I think this is why you get so many founders coming out of this same process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:20):
It's becoming very clear why so many founders emerged out of Ballinger. Okay. So an important element of this as you described, is that the idea here is build this as a one- off solution to solve a real problem at say Airbus or some government organization. And then the idea as you create something out of that, that then Ballinger can sell to other companies. What's extra cool about that is they pay you to solve this problem for them and then that is funding this other product that Ballinger can now sell to everyone. What a cool business.

(00:25:51):
However, early days Ballinger, everyone thought it was just this services business or just consultants building software for companies like Airbus, there's no way they can make this a platform that works for a lot of people. Clearly, that's what's happening and it worked out. This is like the holy grail. Solve one customer's problem and then sell it to everyone else. Every SaaS business basically would love to do this. What do you think allowed them to actually achieve this and be good at this? What are some principles that worked?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:22):
Yeah. That's a great question and it's true. I think that from when I joined until maybe until IPO and a little bit after, I was told, "Hey, isn't this basically a sparkling extension? Isn't it a consulting business lopping as a product company?" And eventually it became undeniable. One, because I always laugh when people are like, "What does Palantir do?" It's like you can go onto YouTube and just search Palantir demo and you'll get plenty of demos of how the software looks. Not many people know about this, but you can go and sign up with a credit card right now and start using it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
I can have a Palantir account?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:22):
You actually can. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
I did not know that. That's cool.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:57):
Yeah. I think it's called AIP now. So it's not actually that mystical and there is a product, and if you look at the margins, they show that. So they have 80% plus margins, which is not really what you would get if you were actually a consulting company. It would be closer to 20 or 30%. So then your question was, well, how did they actually achieve this? I think there was just incredible talent in the product development organization, really top tier, incredible talent. And it took some really, really smart people to take the set of internal tools that we were using at the time to create value of customers and then go, what is the unified version of this? Would this look like if this were a product? And out of that process that I saw came Foundry assume there was a similar process with Gotham a while back. But basically it's like, the motion was that you would go in and early on you were basically armed with Jupyter Notebooks and some data integration stuff, but it was very primitive and you had to create value that way.

(00:28:03):
But we kept building tooling that was useful for forward deployed engineers. So we were our own first customers and at some point there was this concept of, "Wait, what if we take our internal tools and we let our customers use them?" And I remember at the time, this is a really radical idea. And then Shyam Sankar, I think he's the CTO, maybe he's the president now, he just mandated like, "Okay. Every customer deployment you have to have a customer using this within three months or whatever." So it was horrible at the time because these had been built for these nerdy Silicon Valley engineers, and so they weren't particularly usable. They would crash all the time. You'd have to debug spark errors or whatever it was. But basically that process brought a lot more rigor to our thinking about the product.

(00:28:52):
And out of that kind of, I would say three or four year process came the Foundry product. And then there was a lot of focus around things like performance and reliability and so on. That was all really painful. So yeah, I think the answer was just talent. And then there was this recognition that we do. We do know things that most people do not know about how data works in large organizations. That was the other thing. We discovered a lot of "secrets" in this process of living with customers for so long.

(00:29:25):
The basic one was just data integration is massively painful inside organizations. This is very hard to understand unless you've worked in a large organization, but it's actually impossible to even now to get access to a lot of your own internal data that you need to do your job. So you'll hear stories of people being like, "I'm trying to calculate our sales this quarter, and I had to wait six weeks for some other analytics team to get me this deliverable." So just knowing problems like that and being able to focus our product efforts around those problems, meant that we were able to build something generalizable there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
Okay. There's a lot here. First of all, you talk about Gotham and Foundry. I know that we'll link to videos of people checking these out, but just what's the simplest way to understand what these two products do?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:30:10):
So Gotham is optimized for military and defense use cases and intel as well. I would say they both have some things in common. So they both have, I would describe this almost as a pyramid where the bottom layer is data ingestion, the middle layer is data mapping, and then the top layer is anything that's user facing. So any UI component. And then if you think of Foundry for a second, there's different tools that allow you to ingest data to it. There's different tools that allow you to easily build data pipelines and clean up data, which everybody has to do. And then there's a bunch of tooling that allows you to build compelling UIs on top, do point and click analytics, do notebook style workflows, however technical you are. So that's, I mean, when it's a platform, it's a suite of things that has a common data backing but contains a bunch of different applications.So I think that is somewhat true of Gotham as well. But when you log in, you see this unified interface.

(00:31:08):
So what is the actual difference then? I would say with Gotham, you're looking much more at workflows like that involve maps, for example. So when you're doing a military operation, a lot of the time you are going to be looking at a map and you are going to be monitoring the movement of troops or tanks or whatever it is. Another big difference is the idea of graph-based analysis. So Gotham, one of the use cases was finding combing through networks of terrorists and basically finding the bad guys. So being able to do queries that are graph-based was important. So it's like, "Who is everybody that Lenny called in the last week?" Imagine all the nodes fanning out from there. And then it's like, "Okay. Well, this one looks interesting. Let's zoom in on that. What is this person's location?"

(00:31:56):
So it's this very graph-based way of thinking that also applies to things like fraud. So Gotham has been deployed against fraud, but if you look at Foundry, it doesn't actually emphasize that component so much because it turns out, let's say you're a B2B SaaS company, you're probably not doing that much graph-based analysis. You're doing things that look a lot more like classic SQL queries, tables, that kind of stuff. So Foundry is a lot more traditional in that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:20):
That was an amazing explanation. For the first time, I am starting to understand what these products do. Basically, it's just sucks in a bunch of data, cleans it up so you can actually trust it and then helps you interact with it in various use cases, maps, graphs, tables.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:36):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):
Okay. Amazing. The example you gave of what you worked on at Airbus, you described it as basically a sauna for making planes. Is that right?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:44):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:45):
So how much of that does becomes a part of this core product versus stays this one-off thing? Is it elements, that's a cool innovation, let's put that into Foundry. How does that work?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:55):
This was a really interesting story actually. So the initial problem that we came into with Airbus was that they had a new aircraft called the A350 beautiful aircraft. By the way, if you get to, I think if you fly New York to Singapore, it's often in that A350. Really nice. So it was a relatively new aircraft at the time, and their mandate to us was, "Okay. We need to ramp up production of this really fast," much faster than we've ever done it before. So it's like the numbers are very approximate, but it's like, "Okay. We're producing 4 this month, we need to do 8 the next month, 16 the month after, and so forth, and you are going to help us do it." So this goes back to what I was saying earlier is the mandate wasn't like, "Hey, we need to upgrade our data infrastructure. We thought you guys would be met the list of requirements." It was much more just like, "Please help us accomplish this mission. This is the big thing."

(00:33:42):
So we went in, scoped out the problem. There were a bunch of different things that we could build that helped accelerate this, but one of the basic problems that we figured out was that without getting too much into the weeds, the way the factory would work, is that there's a bunch of stations and you can think of the plane as literally moving between each station and then each station would do a certain set of work on it. So initially, it's literally a big fuselage and the fuselage is sitting there and then people are doing a bunch of work orders against it. They need parts in order to do that work. And then at some point they say, "Okay. This is ready to move to Station 31, and the plane is physically moved to the next station and then Station 31 does its next thing."

(00:34:23):
So in order for the next station to do its work properly, they need to know, one, what work was done at the previous station and what work is remaining? Two is just like, if you think about this problem, not all work is going to get done on time. So things carry over to the next team, and the next team then has to... So when I'm describing this problem to you can start to visualize, okay, maybe I need some Gantt chart to this, and I need the ability to click in and say, "Okay. What did Station 30 do and what work orders remained undone?" And then it's like, "Okay. For those work orders, what parts do I need and where in the factory might they be?" So this was very, very hard to do as it is. A lot of it was just relying on people going and having conversations with other people on the factory floor, and coming from tech where it's maybe not as complicated as building aircraft, that is a phenomenally complicated process, but it is easy to see, okay, you can actually improve this problem with software.

(00:35:20):
All that data was stored in SAP and SAP is like established software. It's good at what it does, but it's not the most user-friendly necessarily, especially if you're not an expert in how it stores data. The table names are very hard to understand and read. So one of the things we figured out was just if you can pull in these tables that may as well be written in completely alien language, the table name would just be like S3, F1_Z or something like that. And you'd have to know, okay, this is the table where the part ID is stored or something.

(00:35:51):
If you could pull in those tables and join them in the right ways, and then just map them to human concepts that humans can understand, so things like a part a work order, an aircraft, et cetera, and basically build a hierarchy or mapping between them, then what you can do is, a user can just log in and say, "Okay. Aircraft 79, where is that? Okay. It's at Station 31. All right. These are the work orders, et cetera." So you've translated it into a more human-legible thing.

(00:36:16):
So the thing we built, I slightly flippantly described it as Asana. It's a little different. But basically that's what it did, was it gave you a unified view of, okay, this is what's going on inside the factory. This is the work that needs to be done on this particular plane. And then me today going to my job at Station 31, what work orders do I need to fulfill and where are the parts that I need to do that? So did this directly become a part of Foundry? Not exactly, because the way that other companies work is not going to be using this same set of concepts, but the overall idea of taking a bunch of tables, and then mapping them to human understandable concepts was a very powerful one.

(00:36:58):
So this actually resulted in a big piece of Foundry now, which they call Ontology. You've probably heard this term as you've seen... If you see Palantir presentations, they always talk about Ontology. This is what they actually mean by that, is it is a set of concepts that is understandable to you as a human and you are not having to go and dig around and do. You're just able to say, "Where is the aircraft now and where is it going next?" So the ontology became a huge piece of Foundry. It was directly informed by the learnings that we had from building that application inside that factory. And I would say it's still a very big differentiator today. I don't think too many other companies ship this kind of stuff yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:41):
Wow. I love how excited you still are about this. I could see it being so fulfilling to solve this big problem. I saw a stat that I think, 4X their productivity. What was the number there?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:37:52):
Yeah. I don't recall the exact stat, but we did ramp up production, I think at least 4X that 1 year, which I mean obviously, they did this and we just helped with it. But that CEO said that we played a critical part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:05):
Also, you moved to France, I think for this. That was how forward deployed you were. You lived in France for how long?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:38:09):
Yeah. I lived in France for about a year and a half. The way they built their planes is they manufacture different components around Europe. So they build the tail in Spain and the fuselage in part of the UK and Germany and so forth. So they basically ship everything to France to be assembled at the end, which you can imagine this is a very messy process. So I was mostly in France, but there would be weeks where I'd have to fly between all these countries just to figure out where things were.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):
In your post you wrote about how just the life of forward deployed engineers is pretty crazy. You just get a call sometimes like, "Hey, you're flying to this random country tomorrow. Get ready." Is that just life as a forward deployed engineer?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:38:50):
It is. Yeah. The company had a very, I would say, aggressive attitude towards travel in the sense of when you join, you were basically told, "Look, you have to be okay with travel. Are you okay with that?" And the attitude, which again I think is a very founder friendly one is you need to be willing to just jump on a plane that night if that's the best thing to do for this customer and if it's going to get us to where it needs to be to win. So there were many times when it would be like, "I need to take this cross continental flight tomorrow for this particular thing because it will be useful."

(00:39:26):
So I think that's one of the takeaways for me was just being in person is so valuable when you are working with some external party, just going there for a few days and spending time with them, maybe going out for dinner. You build so much more trust than if you're trying to close a customer over Zoom or do an engagement over Zoom. It's just the vibe is completely different. So yeah, getting on a plane was a really cool part of our job for a very long time. This obviously changed around 2020 because COVID happened, the company IPO, and so there needed to be a bit more internal controls around this. But I would say pre-2020, this was a very big part of the culture.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Andrew Luo (00:40:11):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
So what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files?

Andrew Luo (00:40:28):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We have rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Andrew Luo (00:41:03):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:24):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:41:37):
There's a lot of founders listening to this and a question that I'm thinking and they're probably thinking, and there's two questions here. One is how hardcore to go potentially with their own forward deployed operation. And then two is just how and a company I know is actually doing this, how far to go with one company's problem and invest in just like we are going to nail solving this one customer's problem with the hope that this is something we can abstract and sell as a big platform. So let me start there. And you're building a company, any I guess insights or advice on just how far to go down this road of we'll solve customer one's problem and we bet that this is going to be a big opportunity for a lot of other companies?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:42:20):
So I would say on the forward deployed piece, my friend Barry McCardel, the CEO of Hex, the analytics company, he wrote a really good post about this actually, and his take was just like, "You probably don't need forward deployed engineers." It's very specific. But I think basically the thing there is you have to be willing to be quite almost wasteful. You have to be willing to invest a lot in finding the thing. And for that you just need a certain ticket size. So you need each customer's revenue to be probably in the billions of dollars. If it's below that, you're probably not looking at a traditional forward deployed engineer motion. It's something a little bit different.

(00:42:59):
So I think one thesis that a lot of people left Palantir with and started companies around was there's a lot of customers that Palantir won't serve because maybe they're too small a ticket size. So actually you could go and do something like Palantir for those companies, but instead of charging them $5 million, you're charging them 250K. So in a scenario like that, you might still have forward deployed engineers, but they're not going to France and spending five days a week in a factory. It's more like you'll have one person and they're looking after five different customer accounts. It's more of that ratio in order to make the numbers work. So I think a lot of the principles can be abstracted from that experience, but it is a really specific sales motion that depends on a specific way of doing business.

(00:43:49):
I think to your other question, yeah, I think it's obviously something that is very hard to give a general answer to. My main thing here is just that you can definitely tell when you are just doing consulting and when you are closer to building a product. And I think the error that people make more often than not is they are actually too stuck on their own product vision. That's the mistake I've seen a little bit more actually than the other way around. If you go to an enterprise customer, and let's say you think you're doing analytics software and it turns out they don't actually care about internal analytics this much, they actually have this other massive burning problem and they don't have a good solution to it yet. I think a lot of people are unwilling to go and pivot to the big problem because they're like, "Well, we're analytics software and so maybe this customer is a fit for our thing," and maybe that's the right call. In some scenarios, that is the right call. You should go find a different customer where your thing resonates more.

(00:44:48):
In other scenarios, it's actually the right call to pivot and just put everything on that big problem instead and then go and find other customers for that thing. There's no hard and fast rule. I remember reading a really interesting post by, I think it was David Hsu from Retool who had this exact thing. I think he worked at Palantir for a while too. He said that they had the Retool product and it wasn't getting any traction at all. And then he tried an outbound email campaign where he literally just changed the subject line to build internal tools easily. And then suddenly they started getting all these replies from CTOs who were just like, "Yeah. This is actually a huge pain point for me."

(00:45:28):
But the exact same solution, they were previously framing it as, I think it was supercharged Excel or something like that, and nobody was biting. So they just changed the way they framed it and found a different set of buyers and succeeded that way. So yeah, no hard and fast rule, but I think it's always you need to have this matrix of options in your mind and be very deliberate about which one you are going with and why.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:53):
I think your piece of advice is really important there. Usually in your experience, you're saying people index too far too? Like now, what they're asking me to do is not what I think they need or what customers will need. You're saying it's actually more likely they're right, and that's maybe where you should be focusing more versus this abstract vision and original idea you had?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:46:14):
I think so, yeah. I think it's very hard to not be anchored to your own experience and your conceptions as a problem. And one thing I've seen in really strong founders is they're able to drop a bunch of those assumptions and almost treat a new opportunity as a completely blank slate. And then just figure out how to reshape things so that you're taking advantage of that, and that's how you don't get stuck at a local maximum.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):
Your other piece of advice is also really great. So people hear this and they're like, "We don't afford an engineer to sit at one customer prospects office and build stuff for them." But your point is you can have one for five different customers. They're not there full time. They bounce around, but they're... It's almost like sales engineering, just like what you call it sparkling sales where they help make it successful. I know Looker is a famous example. They think they called them forward deployed engineers. Do you know any other companies by the way, that some version of forward deployed engineers?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:47:07):
There's a lot. I mean, I know that the AR-Labs are hiring forward deployed engineers now, they're building forward deployed engineering teams and they could make it work, but I think there's going to be key differences. I don't see Anthropic going into an enterprise customer and building some entirely from scratch solution for them. It's going to be something that leverages the Anthropic set of products. So there's a lot of companies that have this label now, but I think what's really confusing about, it's just that it means a few different things. There's another post by Ted Mabrey who's I think the head of commercial at Palantir, and that's a very good one too, to point with those too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:46):
So say someone was, "I want to try this sort of thing in my company," what would be a few bullet points if things they should get right? You're describing the spectrum of what people describe as forward deployed engineers, if they were to try to do this, what do you think they need to most do correctly for it to be successful?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:48:04):
The key things that made our model work well, one, they were actually real engineers who could build product themselves. That's a very big difference. I think a lot of the time companies will say, "This person's a forward deployed engineer," but actually they're mostly there to be more of a solutions architect, or they're not necessarily building anything to know, but they're just listening and trying to find a way of deploying the existing product. They're not empowered to do new product. So the really radical thing Palantir said was, "No. Go in and if you need a completely new product to do this, you can go ahead and build it." And I think that's really the key difference.

(00:48:44):
The other stuff I've already mentioned, the value of being in person, and I think building close personal bonds with your customers. I do think the better founders do this anyway. They're on texting terms with their buyers, they become friends with them outside of work, and they see them as humans who they're trying to help. I think this is very motivating, gaining a really deep understanding of the business that your customers are in and knowing how those dynamics work. So a simple example might be, say hospitals in America. It's very counterintuitive to think of a hospital as a business. People think of it as it's a place where you get healthcare, but actually if you view it the way a COO or CMO views it, it's going to look very, very different too.

(00:49:34):
As a very simple example, sorry, this is a little bit dark, but how restaurants want to turn over tables as fast as possible in order to maximize for the day? Hospitals actually want to do the same with patients. They would like to treat you and then get you out of a bed so they can free up the bed to get a new person in there. So that's not super intuitive, unless you think hard about how the revenue for that hospital works. But then once you think about it, you're like, "This has a bunch of problems associated with it." And you start to go into really interesting...

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:00):
... problems associated with it, and you start to go in really interesting directions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):
There's just like the words and memes, and take you a long way working and understanding it.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:05):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:10):
Okay, so essentially the things you want to get right, make sure it's in person, make sure the person is technical, make sure they have a deep understanding of the business and the problems they're having. The technical piece is interesting with AI tools these days, making everyone technical in some sense. You could argue this is going to become more common, people can just open up Cursor, Windsurf and just start adding features.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:30):
I think this is a really interesting thesis you've just hit on, and I expect to see a lot more startups that take advantage of that insight.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:38):
Basically it makes forward deploying engineers cheaper.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:40):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):
What is the current state of forward deploying engineers at Palantir? How much has it changed over the past few years? If you join now, is this still something you can do?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:49):
Yeah, of course. I should obviously emphasize that one, I left the company in 2023, and so this is just my personal view, I don't speak for them. I think that if you think about it, one of the metrics that the company had to measure its own success was essentially revenue per engineer, and so the more "product leverage" you had, the higher that number was. So if you had to throw a lot of people at every marginal problem, then you weren't doing so well at that because you're basically building a new thing every single time, and you are in effect a consulting business. If on the other hand, every time you encounter a new customer, the product turns out to be relevant to them, then great, and so this product leverage metric was actually a very unique thing and kind of a North Star for the company for the whole time I was there.

(00:51:37):
If you reason that out, what that means is that in the early stage of the company, you will have a customer and then you might have five to 10 engineers working at that customer. And so over time you want that ratio to change. So you want it to be each customer, because the product is so powerful, maybe AI coding's gotten a lot better, each customer you only need two people, and then maybe you actually get to a point where you can have one person looking after multiple customers. And I think that's how the job has changed, is now it's a little bit more about you have multiple customers, maybe you're spending less deep time with each individual one of them, but it's a lot clearer what problem you're solving across multiple customers and you have more of a kind of defined offering.

(00:52:21):
And so I do think that has been a bit of a change, but the company remains a very interesting and dynamic place to be. In some sense the story's only starting, because one lens through which you can view this company is they spent 20 years basically building the mother of all data foundations for every important institution in the world, and I guess what's very valuable now that AI models are out is proprietary data that isn't public. Suddenly you have access to that and you are in a very privileged position to help your customers deploy AI in a way that makes them successful, and that solves real business problems. That is essentially the bull thesis for this company and why it's probably going to 100X again. And so it's still a really interesting time to join but I do think the nature of the ratio of people to a customer, for example, is one big difference now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):
Not investment advice, but it might 100X. I totally understand why that might happen. So let's talk about the data piece, you said that this was one of the secrets of Palantir's success, this early insight into the power of ingesting data, cleaning data, being able to analyze and work with it. What a marketing share there, just what they figured out about why this is so valuable, why it's so hard and how they achieved it?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:53:40):
I think it's just very obvious as soon as you step into a corporation and spend a couple of days there really, is you're like, all right, let's suppose your job is to increase sales, so the first thing you want to do is get a clear picture of what's going on. All right, so let me go and query the sales database. Oh wait, where's the sales database? I can't get access to this. Okay, I need to file an access ticket. All right, now I have to wait one week. And so everywhere we went, this was the big pain point, was we have to wait six to eight weeks just to get data access, and then when you do get data access, it's not like the data's in an easily queryable format, you actually really have to know what you're doing in order to get the right metrics out, and so on and so forth.

(00:54:21):
And so it turned out like, okay, it's this iceberg analogy where the actual analysis is actually just the tip of the iceberg, it's kind of the last five or 10%, and the 95% before that is, I am gaining access to the data, I am cleaning the data, I'm joining the data, I'm normalizing it, putting it all in the same format. And so once we spotted that, then it's like, okay, there's actually a lot of product to be built there just to make that process easier. People don't think of Palantir as this place where innovative new product and UX ideas come out, but I actually think it's been one of the most generative companies for that specifically in the last 20 years, it's just that most of that didn't see the light of day and so people don't know. But if you look at the product primitives that they developed in order to make the things I just mentioned a lot easier, they're actually really valuable and interesting and could probably form the basis of independent companies themselves.

(00:55:21):
And so, yeah, it just took every single step of that process became much, much easier once there was a software solution around it. So if you talk about data ingestion, there's essentially a universal data adapter that's part of Foundry. It can read anything, so JDBC, S3 buckets, whatever you want. It allows us to look into the data, maybe preview the first 20 rows, and then it allows you when you're ready to set up a schedule and just pull it in on some cadence. That process alone for an engineer used to take a long time, especially pre-Vibe coding, and managing all those cron jobs and doing this analytics, VM somewhere inside the customer's tenant was a huge pain.

(00:56:04):
And so you productize that piece, then it's like, okay, once you have the data, it's like how do you actually join it? What if you're non-technical? Is there a way for a non-technical user to be able to join tables and see what the result is? And so there's all these very fascinating business problems that, because I think the access was very difficult to get, and people hadn't really solved before, and so there was a lot of white space to do some product innovation. So now I would say Foundry's definitely the best data platform in the world just because it has all these different applications within it that solve these discrete parts. And it came out of this, years of painful experience, watching people have to clean data and join it and figure out what this table name meant and so on and so forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):
You shared in your post this kind of evocative story of some people's jobs is just to gate keep the data. They're there to give you access to this very valuable data within the organization, and how hard it is to get. That was a lot of this work, is just breaking through those political battles of like, "Okay, we need this data for the good of the company and took a lot of work." I guess anything there you want to add?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:57:12):
It is, yeah. It's a huge pain, and there are good reasons for it. It's not like folks are malicious here. If you're IT or if you're an InfoSec type person, then your goal is to prevent data breaches and to make sure that sensitive information doesn't spread too wide. And so what's the easiest way to do that? It's to lock the data down, basically be a gatekeeper for access. I think where it got a little bit more interesting was where your skills are valuable and depend on you being the gatekeeper. So what I mean by that is let's say I'm the only guy who understands the way the sales calculation pipeline works and I write the SQL for it. All the requests from business SMEs come to me, I have a big queue of them, it takes me weeks to get through this queue. I have a great job, I have great job security, and people depend on me.

(00:58:05):
And so now along comes this company and they're like, "Hey, actually we want to make sales data available to everyone and we want to make it point and click." Suddenly you're like, "Hey, hang on, what am I going to do?" And so that's where I think there was a lot of difficulty and I always say people are like, what accounts as competitors? I don't think it's the ones that you would think of necessarily. Palantir's biggest competitor is a company rolling its own solution, and so the biggest difference would just be a CIO saying, "I'm going to build my own data infrastructure, I'm going to own it, it's going to be on top of one of the hyperscalers, and we're all just going to do our own analytics ourselves." And what we came along with, which was quite disruptive to this model, was saying, "No, actually all your data is going to get ingested into this one platform and everybody in your company is going to use it." The trade-off is it's going to be really, really easy for everyone to do things. But as you can imagine, some people weren't a huge fan of that model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:01):
It feels like Glean is the biggest competitor to Palantir after I hear this, do you know about that company?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:06):
I do, yeah, Glean looks amazing from the outside. So many differences there, I can totally see why you would say this, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:15):
Clearly a different use case but it feels like the reason they've been successful is they figured out a lot of this data ingestion, permissions, search stuff. I never thought of it that way.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:24):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
Interesting. Okay, I want to talk about hiring, you talked a bit about this. You're starting a company again, what are some of the key lessons you've learned from your time at Palantir when you are hiring people for your company? I don't know if you're actually hiring people yet, maybe when you may start hiring.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:42):
Yeah, we have six people at the moment, so a really reasonably small team. I think with hiring, it's funny, man, there's so much hiring advice online and you read it and you're like, "Yeah, this is super obvious." And then when you live it, you're suddenly like, "Aah, this is why people say this." So a few simple examples are I think the thing that is really hard to find is somebody who really, really has a lot about doing the thing and will go that kind of extra 20%. I think when you hire out, especially not to pick on them, but I think if you hired a [inaudible 01:00:17] right, it's like people want a 400K a year job, they would like to work a certain number of hours, they would like to ship some code and then go home, that's basically the model that you get accustomed to even if you don't intend to when you work at a big company.

(01:00:31):
And so if you hire out of that for a really small startup, it can be really challenging because a lot of your success as a startup depends on each individual person being like, "No, I'm really going to, I'm work this evening if that's what it takes to get this thing working, and I'm not just going to check my boxes, I'm actually going to look towards what is the real outcome that this business is trying to achieve." And everything I'm saying feels kind of obvious, but when you actually feel that difference between somebody who's just checking the boxes and somebody who's kind of an animal in this way, they'll actually go and pursue and accomplish the end outcome, that difference is very, very big and it matters so much for your first 20 people. And there's no science to finding these people. It's not like you can just put somebody who cares about outcomes in your JD and then suddenly you'll get all these people applying.

(01:01:18):
So then it's like, okay, well how do you screen for that and how do you find those types of people? And so that's where it gets really interesting. I think that's where the mission alignment comes in, and so you do have to find people who, for what you are doing, have this extra maybe private reason to care about it a little bit more than the average person. So I think for Palantir, they did hire a lot of vets, for example, or maybe people who were a little bit more patriotic or pro-America than the average tech employee, and those people had an extra reason to Palantir and an extra reason to try that little bit harder. And so what I'm doing is a little bit more in the kind of medical and health space, and so I think people who have themselves had experiences with this system have maybe had relatives go through difficult experiences with things like cancer or whatever it is. They're just that extra bit motivated to really care about the thing you're trying to do and then work that little bit harder, and so I think aggressively filtering early on to things like mission fit, how much have you cared about stuff in the past, and what's an example.

(01:02:29):
You ask questions like, what's the hardest you've ever worked to get something done and why? And that does differentiate a lot of people, a lot of people don't actually have a great answer to that. So I would say that's been a really big learning, is it's less about testing for the right skills, yes, that's important, two it's much more about just who has that extra 20%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:47):
That is really interesting, everything you've shared is essentially around motivation, and drive, and passion, and kind of just commitment to working on this intently, and it's almost like a second thought of just like, oh, also they're really smart and skilled at stuff. It feels like that's just table stakes and this is actually what makes the difference in your experience.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:03:08):
Yeah, I totally agree, and I think it's different for every business. So I think if you're in a space like B2B SaaS where maybe it's a little harder to tell the story of like, oh, this is so mission-critical, whatever, there are other ways of getting at this thing. So for example, I know a lot of people, again, it's a little played out now, but I know a lot of people who for sales teams, they will explicitly go for people who were professional athletes or played sports in college, and it's like, okay, what does that test for? It's like you are very, very disciplined, you're very, very goals and numbers oriented and you're willing to just work really, really hard. And so there's all these kind of lateral ways of getting at these qualities that I think you just have to be intentional about as a founder. As a personal example, I'm a runner and so I actually love meeting fellow runners and I kind of joke like, "Oh, maybe I'll go higher from run clubs or something like that."

(01:03:57):
But it's just same with I play a lot of chess, I love meeting chess players. I'm not necessarily saying that's the right kind of hire for me, but I think having this thing of here are some traits that seem uncorrelated, but which actually give you good signal to this person's personality, those are actually really important. The last thing I'll say just as a funny illustration of that concept is I think Max Levchin tells the story of somebody interviewing at PayPal early on and he passed all the skill interviews and then it just got to the final round and he said something about liking to shoot hoops, like he liked to play basketball, and they were like instant reject. The vibe here was like if you're not a mega Linux nerd, hardcore computer person, then we don't want you here, even if you actually passed all the tests just because you like to shoot hoops. Now whether that was the right call or the wrong call, don't know, but that's an example of what I'm talking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:54):
I think that's a great echo back. People hearing this may be like, "What the hell? How dare they do that?" But this is exactly what you said at the beginning of our conversation, that like an approach to building a generational business is to be very clear about who this is not for, and that's okay, it's your company, not everyone needs to work there. And it's almost saving them time because they might realize this isn't for me, this isn't the people I want to be around necessarily. So I think it's important to see that side of it, is it's your business, it's important to be clear about who is a good fit for the company and who's not. Speaking of that, let's talk about product management for a bit. I know Palantir PMs are not traditional product managers. I imagine people have the title, Product Manager at Palantir, okay, so if so, as far as you understand what's the difference between say a PM at Palantir versus a traditional PM say at a FANG company?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:05:51):
Palantir was, as far as I remember, quite anti-PM for a while and eventually we did need them because we just got more serious about product testing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:57):
Classic story, classic story.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:05:59):
A classic story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:00):
In many companies,

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:06:01):
The big difference or one big difference I noticed was that they were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deploying engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way. So as an example, when I mentioned earlier the thing that we built for the plane factory, the person who was managing that deployment, she later became the PM for ontology, and it was just because she'd kind of proven her method in the field. And the reason for that's pretty simple, it's going to be someone who understand how customers work and has that customer empathy, and it's going to be someone who has this drive to get things done because that's what BD selected for. I think the failure mode that they were very, very averse to in traditional PMs was this kind of Google Docs syndrome of like, okay, I'm going to write my product requirement documents, and I'm going to manage it in this very sort of sane, rational way I think, so the company was really rigorous about that.

(01:07:04):
And so basically PMs were almost always internal promotions and they always came from BD. I am not aware of a single case where we took somebody who was a PM at a place like Google, which produces many excellent PMs and hired them successfully into Palantir, it's just a very different vibe. So I think that was one thing. This is maybe more of a classic PM trait, but you just had to be either an engineer yourself or extremely good at working with engineers, and the ones I saw who succeeded the most were just best friends with their engineering team. And the team would always just be like one, it was called the group pm and then it would be a lot of very, very good engineers. And basically the success or failure mode was just do the engineers and trust you? I mentioned before Palantir how is very almost disagreeable personalities, and so if you didn't gain the trust of engineering team pretty fast, you didn't last very long.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):
I think we've cracked the question of why are Palantir PM's so successful? First of all, the hiring bar is just basically hiring for leaders in a lot of different ways, to this, I don't know, forge for founders where they're working with a company solving a real problem, building a real product that makes money, and then those are the people that become the PMs at Palantir and then they go on to leave and that's why 30% of them end up starting companies, I'm surprised it's not higher, or become first PMs at other companies or heads of product.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:08:29):
Yeah, absolutely, it's crazy. I was part of a pretty small team within Palantir, I think it was 20 to 25 people when I joined, and I think at least six of them now are either unicorn or just pre-unicorn founders from that group of 25 people, which is actually a crazy ratio. And then a bunch more have become founders recently at an earlier stage, so yeah, there's all these little pockets of excellence and it's been really interesting to see. I think the other thing that's driving that a little bit is when you leave, it's just such an interesting company to work at that I think the retention numbers were actually very high for that company. People would often stay a lot longer than maybe the average Valley tenure. And so when you left, it was really this decision of just something very specific is pulling you and you want to kind of play the next level of the game, and so it was very unusual for someone to leave and then join maybe a more traditional tech company. It's sort of like you're either going to go become a founder or why would you leave when there's so many interesting different things to work on? And I know that sounds a little culty, but that's what everyone thinks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):
I could totally see that. A lot of people that left Airbnb have never found something more meaningful, it's just hard, especially if you're early. There's a stat that I didn't share that I think is really interesting, and when you look at YC founders and where they've come from, I think you maybe shared in your post that there's more YC ex-Palantir founders than there are ex-Google founders in spite of Google being something like 50 times bigger sample size.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:10:00):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):
Let's talk about the moral question of Palantir. A lot of people probably seeing the title of this episode, hearing this, will not be excited about Palantir being highlighted and promoted, a lot of people kind of disagree with what Palantir's doing. Builds products that kill people in some ways, they work with governments they don't agree with. I know you wrote a really insightful way of how you approach this question when you decided to work at Palantir and how you see people tackle with this, can you just talk about the framework that you landed on and how you thought about this yourself?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:10:34):
Yeah, it's a really interesting topic, it's definitely very nuanced. I think what I was trying to say in that post was a couple of things. One was that there was a lot of upside there. So I worked on the US Covid response, I have friends who worked on Operation Warp Speed, and these are all things that I think saved a lot of lives, and I was pretty focused while I was working at NIH on cancer research. And so to me, these were just obviously good things and you couldn't do them anywhere else, and so that was alone a reason to stay. The question I had in that post was, well, okay, there are definitely going to be other pieces of this that people object to. So during the 2016 to 2020 era, it became a pretty common thing to go into work in New York and you'd have people protesting outside your office or doing all kinds of things. And so there was this question of, well, is this okay? And I think the point I was trying to make was it's rare that disengagement is the correct answer, and I think it's more recognized now, but especially then it went a bit too far.

(01:11:41):
So the famous example here is Google kind of disengaging with a Pentagon AI project just because some people felt that working with the Pentagon was itself morally bad. I think that's a way to sort of the left of what the median American would say, I think the median American would say it's fine to work on defense stuff within reason and assuming you're doing largely good things, and so there was just this kind of almost arbitrage there at some point of just hang on, it's not like working on defense is inherently evil, it's actually a pretty interesting thing. And then there's this question of, well, would you rather be in the room and making this better or not? And so I'm struggling with how much I can share here, but as a simple example, if you're doing even a workflow, which I think many people would not be super comfortable with, let's say you're targeting somebody for some kind of strike. If you compare the way it's done now to maybe the way it was done in 2010, it's going to be a lot more targeted, it's going to be a lot more accurate, and so you've actually improved that process and reduced the chance of error. Maybe you should feel good about that, right? Now, that is a bullet many people are not willing to bite.

(01:12:52):
I didn't work on the defense side of the company myself, but I think you have to be okay with these kinds of grade zones and actually actively thinking about what you are doing. And that doesn't mean that it's always the right thing to do to work in a defense company. Maybe we go into a very dark future and we start being the bad guys in some ways, and then it's probably not a great idea to work at a defense company. So it's a shifting landscape but I kind of felt pretty strongly that a lot of people in tech just didn't want to think about this at all.

(01:13:29):
So you have engineers now who are working on optimizing short form videos for higher engagement, and you sort of want to say to them like, "Hey, are you thinking about what this is doing to the brains of young children?" Or "Have you seen an 11-year-old kind of scrolling something for five hours and do you think this is a good thing?" And I think people don't want to think about this stuff too much. I'm not saying I know the answer, but there was almost this refusal to look at what tech was doing from a political lens for a very long time. It was just like, "Hey, let us play with our toys, let us sit in our little park, and don't bother us, and we're just going to build cool stuff and launch it."

(01:14:08):
And 2025, we're in a very, very different state of the world, tech is involved in politics now, and politics basically came to tech. There's this famous image of Mark Zuckerberg, he's sitting in Congress and he kind of looks very pale, and he's like, "Why have they dragged me in here again?" But I think tech went through this journey of, oh, we're suddenly becoming important now, oh, we're really, really important now, oh, we better stop playing this game of politics. And so I think what I'm saying now is a lot more consensus than it was 10 years ago, but at the time, the feeling was just like, "Look what we are doing is political, so you better engage with that."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):
I think when this became really real for a lot of people is with the Ukraine War, the government's running out of certain vehicles and ammunition, we're just not able to produce it, and then we're like, "Oh, thank God for a company like Anduril and all these other tech companies that are actually ahead and keeping us ahead." I think the only reason the US is ahead of that...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):
And keeping us ahead. I think the only reason the US is ahead of China and the space race is because SpaceX just is one company that just has been doing this for a long time. So I think a lot of people have kind of realized, okay, maybe we need these things.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:15:13):
Right. And I would make this argument as well, it's like people are like, well, how can you feel good about working in defense? And it's like, well, you're not going to feel great if China invades Taiwan, actually, you're not going to. I think you are probably also not going to like that outcome. So we do just live in this world where you do need to build up deterrents to these things and they better be good. So to me, it didn't feel that difficult of a question. I think when you zoom into particular things, they can be very difficult questions and there have been a bunch of those in the last couple of years. But yeah, again, disengagement isn't the answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):
Yeah. And again, it's not for everyone. I think that's an important kind of theme through this conversation is some companies ... like, to build ... sometimes to build a generational, really successful company, you need to turn some people off because that's what brings in the best talent oftentimes.

(01:16:03):
Okay. Just a few more questions. Kind of like stepping back a little bit. You're building a company again. What are a few core pieces of advice that you're bringing to your new startup that will inform how you build this company, from your experience at Palantir? We talked about a lot of stuff. Is there anything, I don't know if there are three things that you think are like, "I'm definitely going to do these things this way because it worked really well at Palantir."

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:16:27):
One thing is probably just really fast iteration cycles. So placing a lot of bets and then being really rigorous about just going through that cycle very soon. I have this [inaudible 01:16:40]principles, and one of the things on there is basically saying EOP successes goes up the more bets you make, and it's sort of a function of how many bets you make and the probability of success of those individual bets, right? And so one easy way to almost guarantee that you'll hit something is just to make a lot of bets and then just kind of cycle through them very quickly. Now, obviously this is difficult, often this question of, well, is this bet actually failing or are we quitting too soon, kind of thing. But that's kind of one principle I take, is just test this thing very early. You know, like the classic "why feed, why see" thing is just when you take something to a customer, ask them to pay you a lot of money and [inaudible 01:17:22] then find a new problem. Don't wait three weeks, which is what every founding team typically does because you don't have that kind of time.

(01:17:29):
I do think the importance of just having a really tight, distinctive internal culture and building a strong feeling of trust within a team is really important. And kind of like you mentioned with Airbnb, and people definitely felt this at Palantir, there was this feeling of like, well, you worked here, you must be good. I trust you, and all of that. And I think it's so important to create that and you kind of know that feeling. That's what ... like, people ask me, should I go work at place X or should I just go be a founder straightaway? I don't know the answer for everyone, but I will say one of the benefits of working at a place like that is you just have all these internal benchmarks now for, okay, this is what this should feel like, and if it doesn't feel like that, we're off. And I can't imagine not having those benchmarks and just kind of having to figure it all out.

(01:18:21):
So yeah, I think that thing, too, is just distinctive, internal, strong team culture. And then I think for me, think three is just working with a really messy part of the real world. So I kind of joked when I left, like, I am excited to just do pure software. I'm excited to, I don't know, I want to build an ID or something and just not have a support email even and all of that. But it turned out, look, my comparative advantage in a lot of ways was the networks I'd built and the experience I'd had in engaging with the messy parts of the world. And they do need technology a lot, right?

(01:19:00):
There's this horrifying thought I have sometimes of just like, maybe we'll get ATI in the next two years and the healthcare sector will still be broken and it will still be impossible to afford rent in New York City and build houses and all these things. And that may well become true. And so I think it's important to engage with those parts of the world too, even though they're really, really challenging. And I think the really nice thing about LLMs is that actually, there's so many workflows now that are accessible to you as a tech founder and people are somehow more open to working with tech companies than they ever were before. Selling into the sectors of the economy in 2015, incredibly hard. I think now post the ChatGPT moment, people are willing to give chances to small startups that they weren't willing to do previously. As you mentioned earlier, the cost of doing things like forward-deployed engineering has fallen by maybe five to 10 x now at least. And so there's a lot of new possibilities and I'm excited to engage with the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:01):
Wow, that is some alpha right there that you're finding, that some of these very large organizations are more open to working with startups, because classically, investors don't want to invest in companies that are going after healthcare companies and governments and things like that. So it is really interesting actually to hear.

(01:20:17):
I'm going to mirror back the tips you just shared, and there's actually a secondary tip that I think is the more interesting piece. So the first thing you're taking away is iterate quickly, but I love your tip of ask for lots of money quickly, early, to see if it's an actual idea that people will pay lots of money for. And if not, move on. I love that.

(01:20:35):
The other is build a very distinct culture, but the piece you share there that I love even more is this idea of knowing what a high bar looks like, knowing what awesome A plus people look like, and you need to work at a company like Palantir to actually see that. So the advice there I feel is just work at a company that is amazing, first, with the best talent, to understand what that should look like, plus you build a network of those folks. So I think that's really interesting.

(01:21:03):
And then the other pieces of advice you're pulling away is work on really hard, messy problems because that's where the biggest opportunities are, and it's sounding like this is the easiest time to actually do that. Amazing.

(01:21:13):
Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring theme on this podcast called AI Corner. And what we do in AI Corner is we share some way that .. and this is you sharing ... some way that you've found AI to be useful in your day- to-day, either in life or in work. Is there any way you found some tool ... some AI tool useful that you can share?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:21:38):
Oh my gosh, there are so many. I'll give you a few examples. So I use Wispr Flow quite a bit. So this is the talk to your keyboard and it will transcribe for you app. Very good. It's just great when you are iterating very quickly with an LLM and sometimes you have to do these paragraph-long prompts and it's just easier to speak into them. So Wispr Flow, I like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Just to double down on that, you press a button and you start talking-

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:22:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):
And it's writing out what you're saying. Cool. And there have been these products for a long time, Dragon Dictate and all these guys. Is the difference now these are just very, very good now at actually transcribing what you're saying?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:22:18):
I think that's right. Yeah, they use a really good model and so it rarely makes mistakes even when I think it's quite challenging. And then, yeah, the UX I think they just nailed. So that's really good one.

(01:22:27):
I love Claude Code for developing. Even though I have my complaints about it, there's something just very addictive about just telling it what to do. And it's basically something that you run within the terminal of your computer, and so you just type Claude, it opens up the Claude interface. It's very cute, it's very beautifully designed, and you just tell it what to do. And it actually operates on the file system directly. So if you're like, "Hey, create a bunch of these files," that'll just do it and you don't need to go and muck around inside Finder yourself. And then it'll do these really complicated pull requests and it'll basically execute them quite well. So to me, this is a very exciting kind of preview of AI agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:03):
That's what I was going to ask. So this is essentially an AI agent engineer. I didn't know that's what Claude Code did. Very cool.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:23:10):
Yeah. It's sort of a guided agent, but yeah, it is really sweet. And then yeah, I'm just enjoying ... you know, every week there's a new, wonderful new thing to play with. Last seven days, I've been testing Gemini Pro 2.5. Excellent model. I don't love Google's UX sometimes, but I was playing with that. And I use LLMs every day for all kinds of things. The other day I was doing taxes and I needed to classify a bunch of transactions based on some metadata, and so I just wrote a script up really quickly and it did that. So.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:43):
I love just the smile on your face as you're describing all these AI tools. I think a lot of people are just like, holy shit, I'm just overwhelmed with all the things I need to be paying attention to. All these things I'm hearing, all these tools I got to try. And I love just this vibe of just like, this is incredible and so fun. We need more of that.

(01:24:01):
Okay. I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast. You're going to get a double whammy. Contrarian Corner. So here's the question. What's something that you believe that most other people don't?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:24:12):
I think going to college is great. I think this is a somewhat contrarian view within tech, maybe not in the broader economy, but I often see people saying just like, oh, if you can just drop out when you're 18 and just start working, why would you go to college? And I think this is completely wrong, but maybe it's good advice for 5% of the population who probably would've been to your fellows anyway. But college is one of the few times when you can just make really, really deep friendships. You are in typically a nice campus. If you're in North America, you get to spend all of your time just thinking and writing papers and reading books and hanging out with your friends.

(01:24:49):
And it's actually very precious and it's very hard to find that kind of time after you turn 21 because you got to pay your rent, you've got to work, you've got to do all this stuff. Let's say you make a bunch of money, you take a career break, it's still ... all your friends are working and you always feel like there's a ticking time or on top of your head or something.

(01:25:09):
So just taking those three or four years at the very beginning and going really deep on lots of different intellectual topics and being able to try different things and discover more about yourself. I'm a big college fan. I can't comment on the ROI or whatever. I personally think the ROI is great, even though the fees are kind of high in the U.S., but that's probably my kind of contrarian within tech view is don't drop out of college unless you have a really good reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:35):
It's so funny that that is contrarian and it does sound contrarian. I had a great time in college here. Here. Okay. Is there anything else, Nabeel, that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:25:48):
No, I think it's a really exciting time in the world. I think AI can be exhausting, but it does really just open up the possibility of building a better world in all these ways. And so I think just reassess what you're doing every couple of months and make sure that it's aligned with where I think AI is going and make sure that you are working on something that you feel has very high potential if it succeeds. And I think that's more important than ever now just because the amount of leverage we have with technology is at the highest point in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):
Let me double click on that real quick. So for people that want to do what you're describing, what helps you understand where AI is heading and just kind of align with it, are there places of information and news you find useful? Is it just play with it kind of thing? What would you recommend?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:26:39):
This is the big question. I use X a lot to keep on top of AI, so I would just recommend finding a good Twitter list and maybe following people off of that. There's some good newsletters. I really like Latent Space, I know his X handle, it's Swyx, S-W-Y-X. I can't remember his actual name, but that one is very good and it's pretty technical. I would recommend trying to stick to the more technical newsletters if possible. I think there's a lot of philosophy about AI or AI policy type stuff, and I think that's good if that's your area, but it's an area where it's very easy to have a lot of takes on it. You're not necessarily learning a lot by reading those.

(01:27:16):
But I think it's just important to know what's going on and make sure you are revisiting your own workflows as often as possible. And just making sure that the people who went here are going to be the kind of hybrid cyborgs who fuse with the AIs. This actually played out in chess, if I can take a slight detour, is the chess players who succeeded the most in the mid 2010s especially were the ones who were really early adopters of neural network based chess engines. So when DeepMind did that thing, there was very quickly an open source version of it called Leela, and you find basically the very top players like Magnus Carlson, Fabiano, they were the ones who kind of mind melded the most with Leela and learned how it played and then kind of started copying its moves.

(01:28:06):
And so I think just becoming a cyborg to the extent that you can. And then I think there's this barbell thing of, it's also important to just leave everything at go touch grass just for your own mental sanity.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):
Excellent advice. And with that, Nabeel, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:28:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:28:29):
The first one that comes to mind is Impro by Keith Johnstone. This is actually ... I wrote about it in that essay. It's one of the books that [inaudible 01:28:36] used to send to people. I just think it's a really interesting book. So nominally speaking, it's about improvisational theater, which I believe this guy was a pioneer of. He was a British guy, Keith Johnstone, active between the '60s and the 80s I think. And Impro is just this really interesting book about creativity and how social behavior works and basically just what he taught his improv students. It's a very weird book. It's full of these unbelievably strange ideas. There's a lot of very tactical things he tells you to do in the first chapter, for example, just to break out of your own mental frameworks, really just wild stuff.

(01:29:16):
He'll tell you to walk backwards while counting down from a hundred and think about some problem that you're struggling with and there's all these kind of odd things. But the number of ideas per page I've found on that book is extremely high. The concepts about how social interaction works and how things like status and so on play into your social behavior are super important. And they made every kind of fully deployed engineer read that for the simple reason that I think it just helps you kind of read people better and interact with them better and become more conscious of how you are coming across and just modulate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:51):
What is the title again?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:29:52):
Impro.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:53):
Impro. Okay, cool. We'll link into it in the show notes.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:29:56):
Yeah, so Impro is number one. I think just to go a little more highbrow, maybe Shakespeare's history plays, there's a set of them called the Henriad, so like Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI. I find most people don't read these, so they'll read Hamlet or Macbeth or whatever, but the Henry one is absolutely incredible. You don't have to be interested in British monarchy or British history in order to enjoy them. They're actually some of the most interesting and insightful books I've read about power and how power works and politics and what the sacrifices that you might have to make if you want to be a successful king in that case. But it transfers over.

(01:30:35):
I think it is worth thinking really hard about, I think especially in a world where everything is kind of organized around these prominent figures and personalities now. When you think about the current administration, you think Trump, Elon, or when you think about AI, you think of Sam Dario, right? And so I think it's important to understand, how do you think about these personalities and yeah, the kind of game that they're playing. And Henry is actually ... the Henriad is an incredible kind of set of books around that.

(01:31:05):
They're also easy to read, which sounds hilarious when I say it, but you can read a Shakespeare play in a day. They're sort of ... I don't know, they're like 50 pages long. It's not that bad. You have to get used to the language. Yes. But I would recommend that for sure. I guess you asked for two to three. I love High Output Management by Andy Grove. I just think that's a great business book, and people tend to read summaries of it on the internet more than they actually read the book. But the actual book has a lot of really interesting stories and explanations about ... I think the most powerful thing about that book is actually how Andy Grove thinks, and less any of the specific tactics there. And I think you don't get that unless you read how he came up with all these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):
Your first two books were extremely out there versus what other people have recommended, and the third book was the most recommended book on this podcast. So I love that spectrum that we just went on. Perfect. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've just really enjoyed?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:32:04):
The last movie I really loved was a Decision to Leave. It's a Korean movie. It's by the Director of Old Boy, which maybe some people have heard of. It's a great movie. I think it was released a couple years ago and the basic premise is, there's a detective who is investigating a woman who's accused of killing her husband, and he gradually starts falling for her, which starts to affect his judgment in all these ways. Just a really fascinating kind of psychological thriller with a sort of romantic element to it. Visually, very beautiful. Yeah, I think a lot of the most interesting movies nowadays come from abroad actually. So East Asia, South Asia, places like that. TV, I don't watch so much yet. It's been a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):
Totally understandable for a founder. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical, it could be a water bottle.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:32:58):
I don't have a good answer to that one. I guess I don't buy enough stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:01):
Fully acceptable. There's no wrong answers in the lightning round. Moving on, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you come back to, that you share with friends or family?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:33:15):
So there's this architect called Christopher Alexander who wrote these beautiful books that are about beauty and kind of more than architecture. And he was a teacher at UC, Berkeley, and he got really frustrated with the students because he just felt like they were always turning in kind of average work. And so he would always tell them every week, imagine there's a gothic cathedral in France called Charge. And he would say, you have to aim for Charge. You have to make something that is better than that. That should be your goal, not to just turn in something that's what you feel is good enough. You actually have to try and be better than the very, very best that ever did it. And I find myself just repeating this a lot to myself. It's just aim for that, really try and do that. Otherwise, it's very easy to anchor on something right in the middle. And you do this unconsciously all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:09):
So is that the motto, just aim for Charge?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:12):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:13):
I love that. Most people have no idea what that would be, but with the context is quite powerful. Final question, what's a classic novel that `you think would be most valuable for product builders?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:27):
My favorite novel is Anna Karenina, and I would recommend that everyone read Erica.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:32):
I'm reading that right now. I've never read it before.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:35):
No way. And yeah, so it's by Leo Tolstoy. It's this epic 19th century Russian novel that follows a set of characters across society. And I think it's just extraordinary because what's amazing about him is he's just able to imagine himself into the brain of anybody. And so even ... he will briefly just go into the consciousness of, I don't know, the servant who's bringing the meal to the table or something like that. And he'll just tell you a page of what they were thinking, and then he'll just flip back into his main character's head. And I think that is the most impressive demonstration of this kind of skill I've ever seen.

(01:35:12):
And I think, to connect it to your question, this is what you have to do if you're going to be really good at product, is you have to really think yourself into the other person's head, and you have to be really seeing it the way that they do. And it's so hard, especially as a founder or product person, not to just get stuck on your own way of seeing the problem, right? You wrote up this doc, you made these marks. You're like, this is going to be great. And then you take it to somebody, they don't care that much. You really have to exercise your empathy and understand why they see it that way and what they actually care about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:43):
What a beautiful way to bring it all together. Let me also add, while I'm reading the book, something ... a tip here is, people talk about having Chat GPT voice mode, just kind of sitting there next to you. I found that extremely helpful with this book where I just ask what the hell does this thing mean? There's all these Russian dances and balls and etiquette. You just ask and you're like, I'm reading Anna Karenina, what does this mean? And it just tells you.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:04):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:04):
So there's another cool tip for AI. Okay. With that, Nabeel, this was incredible. Two final questions in case people want to look you up. Where can they find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:16):
Find me online, my website is nabeelqu.co and my X handle is Nabeel QU, I'm probably most active on that, but yeah, my website has all the links and a bunch of essays and interesting stuff. How can you help me? I would say send me an email. My email is on my website. Introduce yourself, say hi. I love meeting people. I don't always have time for coffees nowadays or things like that, but I genuinely do get a lot of energy from just receiving emails from interesting people, so please do reach out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):
Awesome. Definitely check out Nabeel's Principles. Is that the name of that post?

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:53):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:53):
Great. Okay. That's one to start with, and then also there's the Palantir Post that we just talked through. Okay. Nabeel, thank you so much for being here.

Nabeel S. Qureshi (01:37:00):
Thank you. Appreciate it, Lenny.

# Linear’s secret to building beloved B2B products | Nan Yu (Head of Product)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I think you see in the team at Linear that a lot of people don't see, which is that there's not actually a trade-off between speed and quality.

Nan Yu (00:00:06):
People talk about this as if there were a trade-off because when they think about speed, the thing they over-index on is rushing or being sloppy. What they should be indexing on is being really competent. If you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, you can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What does speed look like when you say it can be done quickly and high quality?

Nan Yu (00:00:30):
What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take. By the time 10% of it has passed, after week one, you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
I imagine a criticism you all get. Over time, you'll probably become a bloated piece of software as well.

Nan Yu (00:00:47):
When we examine this problem, we look at, "Well, what feature requests can we debate and what kind of feature requests do we absolutely have to say no to?" The stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes ICs hate their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Something that your head of sales shared with me is how impressed he is with the way you ask questions on customer calls and just keep digging and digging until you get to something.

Nan Yu (00:01:10):
My goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):
Today, my guest is Nan Yu. Nan is Head of Product at Linear, which is one of the most beloved, most beautifully designed, and also the fastest growing B2B SaaS product out there today. You rarely see the kind of love that people have for Linear for any enterprise B2B SaaS product. So, there is a lot that we can learn from how Linear operates and how they build product. In my conversation with Nan, he shares a system that he uses for being creative and coming up with non-obvious solutions to customer problems, why it's a red flag to him when PMs tell him there's a trade-off between speed and quality, how he talks to customers in order to figure out the emotion that they want to avoid and then figure out the solution to avoiding that emotion, plus some killer advice on how to land a job, including how he landed his job at Linear and his previous role at Mode, and so much more.

(00:02:06):

(00:04:56):
Nan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nan Yu (00:04:59):
Thanks for having me. I'm a long-time listener and reader, so it's really a treat to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
I want to share something with you to kick off that I haven't shared with you yet, that I haven't shared with anyone. These results might have come out by the time this podcast comes out, but I'm running a survey right now that I'm calling, "What's in your stack?" Where all my subscribers are asked, "What tools do you use most day to day? What tools do you love most? What tools do you hate?" And one of the questions asked was, what tool do you wish you could switch to if your IT department allowed you to? The number one answer by far is people want to switch from Jira to Linear.

Nan Yu (00:05:38):
Wow. I mean, hopefully, that means we're doing a good job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I think that's exactly what that means. I'll read a couple quotes to give you a sense of what people are saying about Linear. I doubt these are surprising to you, but this gives people a sense of why you're here and why I'm excited to extract as much wisdom as I can from you. So, a couple quotes here. "Linear is a joy to use as I interact with my engineering teams, and I find inspiration in its design." "Linear is simple to use, yet powerful." "Linear's design is obviously an industry benchmark, but moreover, the performance and speed is a massive productivity boost."

Nan Yu (00:06:12):
I mean, it's really good to hear that because in a lot of ways, that's what we're trying to do. If you think about the entire impetus behind why Linear was started, it's because Karri was sitting at Coinbase and Airbnb and these places and just watching everyone around him struggle using the tools that they had available and always incumbent tools and just seeing that it made people hate their day-to-day a little bit, and we all got into technology and design and engineering, all this kind of stuff because it was fun. All of us started off building stupid MySpace pages and all of these side projects when we were young, and it started off as this fun thing that we do, and we're like, "Wow, we get to do this for a career," and then to have all of this kind of stuff put these big speed bumps into our day-to-day workflow, it just was really sad. So, that's why we started Linear. This really bust through all of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:11):
What I love about Linear, I feel like it's an inspirational business because many people want to, "I'm going to build just a much better version of something," and often that doesn't actually work out. Often nobody cares enough. There's all these barriers and reasons. People don't switch to something that's better, and Linear is an amazing example of building an excellent product and actually succeeding, and there's a lot more to it maybe than just building an awesome product. So, that's what I'm excited to dig into and understand how you all operate, and I guess just based on these results, to me, this is the ultimate sign of product market fit. People being sad they can't use a product in B2B enterprise software especially, so let's get into it.

(00:07:52):
First question I want to get into is something that I think you see and the team at Linear sees that a lot of people don't see, which is that there's not actually a trade-off between speed and quality. I think a lot of people think this is just an innate fact and something I've heard you talk about is that's not actually true. I actually saw Patrick Collison tweet this exact point that I'll read after you... I want to hear your thoughts, but talk about what you've learned about how there's maybe not actually this trade-off between speed and quality.

Nan Yu (00:08:20):
People talk about this as if there were a trade-off almost in a naive way because when they think about speed, the thing they over index on is rushing or being sloppy, and what they should be indexing on is being really competent or being like an expert. So, if you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, it could be anything. It could be like a chef or a programmer or someone building houses or something. You can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going. If they're going really fast, and they're obviously not being sloppy and then leaving a mess all over the place, it's like, "Yeah. Well, they got there because this is just second nature to them," and they're able to go at a really rapid pace and try stuff. And when we're building software, that's such a big component of how good the product is on the other side of it, which is like, "How many iterations were you able to do?" So, the only way you're going to get a bunch of iterations done and try different things and really feel out these different variations is by just going very fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):
In terms of speed, is the speed there moving quickly on each of iterations? Like what does speed look like when you say, "It can be done quickly and high quality"? What does speed look like?

Nan Yu (00:09:36):
Speed... What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take, and by the time 10% of it has passed, you have a workable solution. It's not like, "Oh, at the halfway point, we have something that is maybe a candidate that we can play around with." It's like, no, no, no. After week one you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally so that you can feel like is this thing actually panning out the way we expect it to or did we have some crazy incorrect assumption? And you don't want to wait until you're 80% done to be able to make that kind of judgment because then it's just too late. Then you're pushing deadlines out, and you're making your marketing team very sad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Amazing. Okay, so the way you think is, "We're going to spend a month on this feature. Let's get something workable. We can start testing with potential users even internally in the first few days, essentially in the first week"?

Nan Yu (00:10:30):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:32):
Yeah. I guess how can you do that? Because most teams can't do that. Most teams need to research, design, build. "Okay, cool. We have something," and once a month later, what allows you to do that?

Nan Yu (00:10:43):
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of components of it. I think having really good talent really helps. Having engineers who don't get blocked by every single little design choice, they're happy to just make something workable. Even if they don't feel comfortable with that particular solution, they'll just bust through it and make something happen there. Part of it is intent. We don't have any expectation that the first version of it is going to be great. That is not in the cards. Look, the first version of it is our best guess in the general direction of what we want to actually ship in the end, and sometimes it works out. Sometimes, it's like, "Wow, this first version was pretty good. Let's make some minor adjustments, and we're good to go," but there's no expectation there. So, no one feels like they have to be a perfectionist and get everything, like all sanded down and really in tip-top shape. It just has to work and get the job done and validate or invalidate our major assumptions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:38):
I'll read this quote from Patrick Collison. He tweeted this today as I was preparing for this interview, and he's the CEO and founder of Stripe, if you're not familiar. His tweet is, "I increasingly believe that 'good, cheap, fast -- choose two' maxim is devious misinformation spread by the slow. In my experience, slow and expensive usually go together."

Nan Yu (00:11:57):
Yeah, exactly. I mean, use the contractor kind of example. Like If someone's making modifications to their house, and it's taking forever, one, you're in a hotel and also the bills are adding up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
The other example you used when we were chatting about this earlier is chess players. I'm thinking of Magnus Carlsen, watching him. I think he was number one in speed chess in addition to just regular chess and what a microcosm of this point.

Nan Yu (00:12:22):
Yeah, I think that's the case and Magnus and Hikaru and all those guys who are at the top of their game, they can go unbelievably fast. In fact, that's the usual... I mean, I don't want to get too out of my depth with chess, but the usual way you try to make the game fair is you give them much, much less time than someone who's not quite as strong of a player, and they'll still win a lot of time, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:43):
So, maybe just to close out this point and give someone something concrete they can do with this information, say they want to start moving faster while not cutting quality, what do you think they can do? What's one thing they can start trying to work on and improving in the way they operate?

Nan Yu (00:12:58):
I think it's really that sort of attitude and point of view question to understand and take the almost controlled risk that the first version of this is not going to be perfect. So, it actually makes it a lot cheaper in many ways. It means you don't need a pixel perfect design. It means you don't need to make sure that all of the little UI bugs and stuff like that are solved because none of that really matters. What matters is you have working software that you can interact with, and you can see if it feels good. Does it actually solve the core problem that is facing our users? You can take it back to users. You can even let them into an early beta or something like that and get real validation there and to really focus on getting the smallest, shippable element, like not shippable in the sense of, "I can actually put on the production," but in the sense of like, "I can start learning from here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):
Just a question I imagine is in everyone's mind is what do you do with this first very ugly V1... not ugly, not fully ready, first version. Is this something you're using internally to see if it's something? Is it something you have beta design partners with?

Nan Yu (00:14:04):
We have a gradually increasing sort of circle of users that use every single feature. So, by the time it hits GA, by the time it gets released, it's been used by a lot of different users up to that point. So, the first circle is just internal users. We use Linear every single day to write software and do our own work, so we have that kind of advantage and then once we feel like it's good enough, we'll put it into some beta customer group, and again, as early as we can in the process. We have to make sure that we don't end up corrupting people's data, and it doesn't look hideous and that kind of stuff, but as long as it reaches that level of quality, we can release it to early access customers who can give us good feedback and also just try to solve their problems with it. If no one engages with it, if no one's using it, then that's a good signal that we didn't really hit the mark, and then we have a couple of different beta audiences that we grow and then the ultimate release obviously is for GA where everyone gets it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
That's an amazing answer. Okay, so secret number one to Linear success, I'm going to take some notes here, is get new feature, product ideas out to people as early as possible, say, in the first 10% of the amount of time you've allotted, and then release it increasingly to more and more people to get feedback. I think the implication here is just most wasted time is on building things nobody actually ends up wanting or using. So, the sooner you at least get directional sense of are you heading in a good direction, the faster it all go?

Nan Yu (00:15:30):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):
I imagine a criticism you all get. People are like, "Yes, Linear is so great, so beautiful, so much better than what's been out there for decades," but over time you'll probably become a bloated piece of software as well. That's just the fate of enterprise software. You have to check all these checkboxes. IT teams need all these features. So, there's always this like, "Oh, yeah, sure, you guys can operate this way for now. You have an amazing product for now, but it'll get ugly and bloated." How do you think about avoiding that? I know it's something you spent a lot of time thinking about. Maybe give us a glimpse into some of the conversations you have internally when there's these feature requests like, "Oh, I need single sign-on with this thing and this button here." How do you think about what to add, what not to add, and how to add these features to not make it bloated?

Nan Yu (00:16:14):
This question actually comes to us a lot from candidates that are interviewing with us. When you go like, "Hey, do you have any questions for us?" This is the question that we're going to get. So, we hear it quite a lot, and it's very sensible for them to ask it because they see history being littered with the corpses of startups trying to compete in this space and not making it, and I think when we examine this problem, we look at, "Well, what kind of feature requests can we debate and what kind of feature requests do we absolutely have to say no to?" And the stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is also the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes ICs hate their lives, and it's very specific. It's customization features requested by middle managers in order to make reporting a little bit easier at the cost of making IC workflows worse.

(00:17:16):
It's like if it fits that description, we're just saying, "No." There's no debate because we've already thought about it and this is the thing that we can't take a single step down this path. So, I think that's honestly one of the core promises of Linear is that we will not make this particular trade-off. So, when you see people saying like, "Wow, Linear is so much faster. It's so much easier to use and it makes my work so much more enjoyable." This is the reason because we have not taken a single step in this direction. It's very easy for a PM to say yes to this kind of request because often they're talking with buyers. Any kind of B2B type of space, they're talking with whoever the gatekeeper is and sales is putting pressure on them, and they're saying like, "Hey, we really want this one feature. It's going to make our reporting nicer." 

(00:18:02):
So, the director's going to be really excited by this, and we'll definitely make a buying decision based off of this, and we have to convince them that this is a false trade-off. The whole premise is wrong because the moment you start going down this path, and you make the IC user experience worse, they're just going to disengage. No one has to do this. If I'm an engineer, I get paid to write code. My performance review is based on my code contribution. It's not based on like, "Did I fill in all the tickets right?" So, I'm just not going to do that part, or I'm going to do it very sporadically, and then I'm going to just focus on my actual job. 

(00:18:38):
And then all your reporting is wrong because all the data is wrong, and it's sparse, and you get situations where people will... They'll say like, "Well, here's a dropdown field that someone put in here that's required." There's nine choices. I don't know what any of them meet, so I'm just going to pick one at random. I'm still going to pick the first one. Also, I'm going to pray that my boss is not actually using this data to do any kind of reporting and that has consequence because the data can't possibly be correct. So, I think for us, it's a very easy decision when it comes to that particular category of feature request.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:12):
I love how simple and clear that is. Basically, you all have a policy. We'll prioritize ICs over middle managers. Especially, like I love that it's around reporting. Almost always it sounds like, "I want to track what's happening."

Nan Yu (00:19:23):
Yeah, exactly. It's always, "I want to track what's happening." Well, what do you want to track? Well, I want to track which version of the product this thing's tied to based on some field information. It's like, okay, how is the person working on this supposed to even know that information? Well, it takes like a five-minute scavenger hunt every single time. It's like, "I don't think they're going to do that, man."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:43):
What I imagine happens, and I think why this is hard for most companies is there's an implication that you're turning down deals. You're not adding that one feature that will close a massive million-dollar sale, very difficult to do. I imagine it helps a lot that... I imagine the COO is very bought into this and there's this, "We will win long-term holding the line on this." Is that right?

Nan Yu (00:20:05):
So, it is, but I also think that there's not as much pressure as you would expect to do these kinds of things. There are basic scaling things, like we had to make SAML and SCIM and that kind of stuff. It's like, "Yeah, sure, we're going to do those sorts of, like keep the lights on type of work," but when it comes to work that's related to the actual business logic of the app's value proposition, what buyers care about is, is this going to make their team more effective? That's the reason that they're making this buying decision in the first place is that they're like, "Well, the current situation we're in... " And especially with large companies, right? The current situation we're in is a mess, and if we can convince them that these types of things are actually the reason that it's a mess, then we can really navigate them out of wanting them in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:57):
Got it. So, there's an element of you think you need this, but it turns out you'll be more successful and get everything you want, not getting this?

Nan Yu (00:21:04):
Yeah, and the thing is, it's not everything you want, right? Because people come with a laundry list, and it's like laundry list. Here's 10 things I want. You're like, "Do you want all of those 10 things equally?" They're like, "No, actually I don't." The first three are the things that really matter to us. If we solve the first three, then the other stuff, we can negotiate on. So, our job is to solve the first three-way better than anybody else that if they got through the first three through some kind of visual programming, customization type of thing, that it's never going to get to the quality level and the depth that we're able to offer by offering those as native features.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:37):
It's interesting thinking back to that survey I shared where the tool people want to switch to if IT allowed them was Linear, and on the one hand you could argue, "Well, okay, IT is not letting them use Linear for all these reasons.  On the other hand, you guys are growing really quickly within enterprise, like you're a new business. You started, I think, mid-market startups, and now you're working way up. So, I think it's not fair to say it's not going to work in enterprise. It's clearly working really well. I don't know if there's any stats you can share anything of that, but it seems to be going well, expanding up market.

Nan Yu (00:22:11):
Yeah, I mean, growth has been good. Growth in enterprise has been leading the other segments because I think this year, especially we reached a tipping point where I think with software, so much of the buying decision is based on almost like a brand thing, like is this for us? A lot of times people pick "enterprise software." It's like, "Why? You know everyone doesn't want this," and they're like, "Yeah, but it's for us." 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):
You won't get fired for buying Microsoft or whatever.

Nan Yu (00:22:39):
Yeah, exactly, and I think that we're starting to have enough brand penetration amongst enterprises where people can have that feeling, right? They're like, "Hey, Linear is for us. Who are we? Well, we are a large company that wants to act like a startup." It's like, "Who doesn't want that? Who doesn't want to go fast?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:58):
Yeah. I had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast, and this is exactly what crossing the chasm looks like. He talked about basically you need someone that's across the chasm like a later adopter that isn't the person that's, "I love new stuff, and I'm an early adopter kind of evangelist." You need someone that's like traditional old school, takes their time to start to adopt it for you to be like, "Oh, okay. Now, maybe I should really take it seriously."

Nan Yu (00:23:21):
I also think that with this particular category of tool, and with a lot of other B2B software, not... Like no means not now, right? Not right now because it doesn't fit our budget. It doesn't fit our change management situation. "Oh, we have this exec that's really wedded to this other tool," but those things change, right? So, we keep in contact with them. They're in our CRM where we make sure we follow up, and we've had a lot of these where we've been said no to, like two years ago, and now we have some new features, and then go like, "Oh, yeah, it seems like you're ready for our scale," or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):
You mentioned that when you have these debates and questions that come out, you have features that a big company wants. There's this category of, "We know we will not build things for middle managers that want reporting and custom stuff just to track what's happening," versus something an IC wants to be more productive and successful, Linear. Give us a little sense of some of the more complicated debates that aren't necessarily in that bucket.

Nan Yu (00:24:22):
I think the complicated debates are often when we do add a new native feature, do we extend an existing feature and make it more powerful or do we add a new sort of service? And a big part of that is trying to figure out exactly who's going to use it, what are the actual real life use cases that we know about? Like that I know that Bob from Company X has this workflow and this is how it would work for him. Here are the different variations where it would work. So, tying it all the way back to real people is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Like a specific person?

Nan Yu (00:24:53):
Yeah, specific person. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Not a hypothetical person. Not one that you made up like Alice, Bob, or whatever. It's like, "No, here's the first name, last name. Here's their email. You can ask them," and I think that being able to tie it all the way back to reality in that way is a big part of how we really think about and discuss these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This connects the way I think about my newsletter is I always try to answer the question a very specific, like a person actually asked, not a general sense of something people may be interested in, and that very specific question, like it implies there's a need. Like not implies, it proves there's at least one person who needs this thing versus you have this idea of somebody that may want this thing. 

Nan Yu (00:25:36):
Yeah. I think a trap that a lot of times PMs will fall into is they'll make something, and they'll make some choices in it because maybe it's beautiful or it's elegant, but they don't go the step of like, "Is reality also beautiful and elegant?" Because reality is ugly sometimes, and if you have a beautiful and elegant solution that doesn't match with reality, it doesn't really matter. People can look at it, and they can ooh and ah, but if they don't use it to get their work done, it's never going to have long-term staying power.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
Do you have a heuristic of how often you need to hear something for you to... could be just convinced, this is worth investing in? People may hear this, "Oh, one Bob. Bob wants this featured." That doesn't make sense. It's just one guy. How do you know when it's like, "Okay, we should really invest in this"?

Nan Yu (00:26:17):
Part of it is you hear something, and you're like, "Gosh, that actually is... " Not only is that true. It means that the way we thought about this was a little bit wrong, and I call this process... I don't know if it's the right way to describe it. I call it a kneeling where you have a thing, and it's not quite the right shape, and you put it out into the wild. So, this happens way in the first bit of the life of a particular feature. You release a thing, and then you start getting feedback about it, about hey, it doesn't quite fit reality, and then you ask yourself like, "Did we test that aspect of it? Did we actually match that part to reality?" And if you didn't, then it's like that's the part where you don't actually need that many pieces of feedback against it. It's not really a volume thing. It's like, "Did we think about this right or wrong?" That's one sort of category.

(00:27:01):
Another category is just you're getting a request for maybe a very big feature or a feature set from a lot of different people, but then you dig in, and you try to say like, "Okay. Well, tell me about how you're trying to use this," and there's 100 different use cases. So, you have choices here. You can either build the big feature that covers all the long tail of use cases or you can try to see if there's really concentrated pools of use cases for this that really make a lot of sense to adopt as a first order type of feature. So, I think those are the two sort of strategies that we employ the most. It's like, "Did we think about this wrong? And now we're just learning something about how it matches reality or for this big general feature that people are asking for, are there actually more specific use cases that we should be solving, and we should be solving really, really well?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
A thread that's coming through so far across a lot of these examples is getting to the specific person using the thing and making them happy and making sure the ask is going to solve their actual problem. In the case of looking at the IC versus the middle manager, in this case, it's like, "Let's talk to the person actually asking for this thing," not, "There's like 100 people generally asking for this thing and let's build what we think is a general solution."

Nan Yu (00:28:18):
Yeah. I'll give you an example of all of these things, which we just launched a feature called Customer Requests, and basically what this does, it adds a new concept of Linear, which is a customer. For B2B companies, this is very relevant, and the reason we did this is because we kept getting this request for fully customized fields, and we would be like, "Well, what is it that you want with your custom fields?" Because the problem is you add 100 custom fields and all your ICs start hating it. So, we don't want to go down that path, but what is it actually you're trying to do? And 40% of them were because, "Well, I have a customer," like Walmart or whatever, right? Like, "Walmart asked for this feature, and it's really important. I need everyone to know that Walmart needs this. I need to track it. I need to see how have we report... " 

(00:29:09):
We can report on what have we done for Walmart over the past year so that when my CSM has a one-on-one conversation with a rep, they can have some kind of evidence that we've been doing stuff for them, like all this kind of stuff. We're like, "Okay. Cool." That sounds like a very useful and powerful thing you want to do. How do you expect people to tag these things? Well, manually, because that's how we did it in our spreadsheets. It's like, "Okay, instead of that, we're going to hook up with your customer support tools. We're going to hook up with your CRNs. We're going to automatically bring in feedback from these companies. We're going to analyze the emails where they're from, and then if someone requests a feature that gets escalated into engineering, it'll just be tagged with whoever asked for it. You don't have to do anything, but you will know, and you can still report on this stuff, but there's nothing about this that makes ICs lives harder.

(00:29:54):
In fact, it makes them feel more confident because when they're building the thing, they actually understand who's asking for it and exactly what the email said. So, when they're doing the design or the details, they can actually see the real-life use cases that are present and solve for those directly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:09):
As I'm hearing this, it's like, "Okay, obviously, this seems like an obvious solution. Of course, 40% of people telling me they have customers." In reality, most of the time, if you hear from a bunch of your customers, "Hey, I need this custom field," and sometimes you hear one thing, sometimes you hear another. Most of the time you're going to build this custom field. Something that your head of sales shared with me is how impressed he is with the way you ask questions on customer calls and just keep digging and digging until you get to something that is an insight for you, and then you start to try to solve the problem for them and think about what the product might be, and I think this is such an important and underappreciated skill for PMs. Is there any advice you could share of just how you approach this, how you ask questions, how you think about these customer calls to get to, "Okay, now, I see what we need to build versus let's just build what they're asking for"?

Nan Yu (00:30:59):
It's funny because I think from the outside, I'm on these sales calls and then the AE or someone's watching me ask these questions, and I think often they're like, "What are you doing? You're just asking questions from angles that I don't even know what your goal is here," and my goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad. They come to us with a request, "Hey, we want X," and it's like there's something motivating it and you can do the normal analytical thing and be like, "Ask five whys," and try to figure out like, "Well, what are your goals?" "And as a persona X, I want to achieve this outcome." You can do it that way, but you might miss the reason that they actually feel bad for not having this thing like, "I can't accomplish this goal. So what?" "So, I'm not going to get promoted at work."

(00:31:44):
Okay, great. I understand the severity of your problem at this point. What is the actual emotional valence that is motivating whatever you're telling me? And it takes a little while to get there. You can ask people directly like, "How do you feel?" And they're not necessarily going to tell you, but if you have a long enough and deep enough conversation with them, you start to level with them, and you're starting to see stuff from their perspective, and the more you see it from their perspective and the more they know that, the more they're willing to open up to you and tell you like, "Okay, honestly, I had this thing happen where I marked the ship date of this project as December 30th because it's a Q4 project, and I wanted to put it at the very end, and then my marketing team lost their mind because they're like, 'We can't ship something on December 30th. Everyone's on vacation,'" and you're like... And then they're like, "Yeah, this has made me feel really bad." 

(00:32:36):
So, I don't ever want to put dates on things ever again. So, like, "Okay, cool. We can help you deal with that. If that's what you're feeling, then I can start building stuff to make sure that you never have to have that bad feeling again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
People talk about empathy like, "You need to have empathy as a PM. You need to build empathy the best product leaders, have empathy in this." I think it's such a succinct and powerful way of describing what empathy actually looks like as a product leader, which is I want to feel as bad as they feel in hearing the story they tell, and it sounds like the way you do that is you keep asking questions to understand the moment they felt bad about something. In this case, the deadline.

Nan Yu (00:33:17):
And if you ask somebody in that last story, like what kind of issue do you have? You're like, "Oh, marketing and I would just never align on anything." It's like that doesn't really tell you what's going on. What it tells you is you had this terrible moment of communication that it's all miscommunicated, and you're like, "It's just going to keep happening over and over again." So, the thing that we did specifically to solve this was on projects in Linear, you can just specify a target date at whatever level of granularity you want. You can say it's a December project. You can say it's a Q4 project. You can say it's a second half of 2024 project. Like whatever you're happy promising, you can just put it on there and that way you never feel like you have to give this sense of false precision so that it ends up with a whole bunch of miscommunication down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:04):
I could see why people love Linear is it just makes them feel less bad less often. There's a lot of connection here. I know this idea of emotions and feeling bad is a core part of how you think about building product, looking for moments. People feel bad. Is there anything more you could share there to share how you think about this idea of emotional hooks, emotional moments, and how you decide what to build?

Nan Yu (00:34:27):
So, to set the background of this, I've worked in very, very competitive industries. I worked at Everlane, which was a direct-to-consumer clothing brand. I worked in Mode, which is like BI tools and there's so many BI tools out there, and then obviously, Linear. We're project management. There's a lot of project management tools, and I think the more competitive your industry is, the more the low-hanging goal-oriented stuff is already picked because every PM from every one of these companies has been asking like, "Well, what's your goal? What is your job to be done," and all this kind of stuff. So, you have to look at things from an angle that other people might not have seen and for me, and for us, it's the angle of where are the emotional hooks that you're experiencing as you go through your work day, as you use our product, as you use competitors' products?

(00:35:21):
I think it's probably underexplored because... I don't know. I feel like PMs and engineers, we're like very thinky people. We avoid the touchy-feely stuff. So, I think that's the opportunity. You can see where are you feeling bad throughout your day where you don't even know? You might think, "I hate Mondays." "Why do you hate Mondays?" "Well, on Mondays, I have to go out and gather a whole bunch of stuff to write this report that it's really annoying." "Oh, so if I gave you a button that made the report, would that help?" It's like, "Oh, yeah, then I might not hate Monday so much." So, I think Paul Graham has a word for this. He calls it schlep blindness, right? It's like I'm schlepping through life, and I'm just completely blind to it, and it's true. You have to have an outsider come in and see what the rhythm of your feelings are throughout the day, throughout the week, and you note the spots where you could really use a lot of improvement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Is there an example? I've shared a couple, but just where you've noticed this in someone using maybe a competitor or even Linear that you solved. I know you gave an example of the dates. I guess is there anything else?

Nan Yu (00:36:26):
A big feature that people love about Linear is we have this thing called Triage Management, and what it does is it systemizes this thing where if I put an issue into a different team, if I'm asking them to do something or I'm reporting a bug to them, it sticks in a special zone where it'll notify the right people. They're on a rotation and people will be able to respond to it in an organized manner, and I think this kind of automation, this feature, it came out of two different fields people were having. One, people were trying to implement this stuff by hand, and it was just a lot of touches, and they were doing it, but they felt like, "Oh, I'm totally underwater." "Why are you under water?" "Well, I have to throw all these tickets around and route them correctly and stuff like that," and they didn't see this as an opportunity to have a tool specialize in managing their triage queue. 

(00:37:23):
Because they were managing by hand.... They were on top of it, but it just felt really bad because they just had to spend so much attention doing this and then there's the folks who didn't do that. The feeling was just like, "Well, it's totally out of control. People are just throwing tickets over the wall, and I don't know what to do with them. I don't know where they are. They end up in all these holes and then the people on the other side are like, "I throw tickets over the wall. I have no idea what happens to them. I have no expectation that people are ever going to respond to them." So, there's all of these bad feelings that people are having. They all have the same root cause, which is like there wasn't a very automated organized way to deal with your triage queue.

(00:38:55):
I'm going to try to summarize some of the secrets of Linear's success so far. So, the first is get something out as quickly as possible, say, in the first 10% of the time that you have to build this thing and get it out to internal users and then maybe a growing list of beta users and people that are aware of they're using early stuff. Two is prioritize the IC and the user, basically, versus the buyer or the middle manager that wants reporting and all these custom features. So, it's basically focused on the user, which I think you hear a lot, but I love this very specific example. Three is when you hear asks for features and requests, get to the specific person using the thing, not just general, "Okay, cool. I've heard it 100 times." Find the person that actually needs this thing and understand what's going on, and then four is look for people feeling bad in a moment working in the product. Is there anything else that I'm missing that's important or any nuance you want to add?

Nan Yu (00:39:54):
The part where you said, like focus on the user, I think it's maybe a little bit more subtle than that. There's a nuance which is find where the incentives are really misaligned amongst your user base. There's a middle manager that wants really detailed reporting and there's a IC who just really doesn't want to go through all those extra steps, and the incentives for what they want are just very... They're just very misaligned, and you have to find those situations and be pretty judicious about how you make those trade-offs and where you can really find win-win outcomes there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:30):
That's a really important nuance. Something else that's come through a couple of times as you've been talking is also something Patrick Collison tweeted once that has stuck with me, which is this idea of having a mental model in your head of the user. So, the way he described it and the way you've described it is oftentimes people are like, "Cool. We're going to figure out what to build. We're going to do a bunch of research, talk to users. That'll inform what we build, and we build it, versus what you've been saying and what he said is you do a bunch of research, look at data, talk to people. That informs your mental model of what the customer needs in their life, and then that informs what you build. So, that anytime you do more research, talk to customers, it's informing your view of the person, and then you're like, "Oh, this was different from what I imagined," or, "Oh wow. This is exactly what we've been thinking and let's build that." Anything along those lines that you might want to share?

Nan Yu (00:41:19):
Yeah, I mean, I can tell you a little bit about how we manage our backlog, which I think actually ties directly into this. At any given moment, we have probably 20 or 30 opportunities that we could possibly explore, just product opportunities, like problems to solve, areas to improve for our users, but they're not ready yet. We don't have enough conviction around how we might approach it. So, we just accumulate understanding of this stuff and periodically, we accumulate some more stuff, and then we reevaluate, "Okay, what is our current understanding of how we might best approach this thing?" And I think something that people struggle with is that they might have this model in their head. Like a PM might have this model in their head about how a user behaves, but it's just very hard to share that with someone else. You have to telepathically throw it into their brain, which is hard. So, what we try to do is identify areas that we might attack with a product, but also keep an up-to-date analysis of each of those areas so that everyone can engage with it and also contribute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:22):
Is there an example of something that's sitting in your roadmap? I don't know if you could share these sort of things that's just sitting in the backlog of just like, "We're not quite ready to tackle this yet, but here's something we're inkling on."

Nan Yu (00:42:31):
Yeah, sure. Capacity planning is a thing that's been sitting in our backlog, and it's something that we see managers struggle with all the time, which is like I have a limited amount of personnel and resources, and I need to deploy them in such a way where we can theoretically accomplish our roadmap, but also we don't get blocked by some bottleneck that we don't end up blocking all of the projects because this one engineer is stuck on some info thing, and that's a thing people struggle with all the time. All the solutions out there are bad. The best solution is a very, very custom spreadsheet that someone would make, and it's a lot of upkeep. So, we have some ideas about how we might automate this, how we might use existing data within Linear to really help out with this problem, but I don't think we've quite cracked it yet. 

(00:43:18):
I think there's some nuances that we have to really explore a little bit further. So, we're continuously developing this, and as we hear from hear from users that are struggling with this problem, we will get on a call with them and sit down with them and talk through it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:31):
And the idea there is keep informing this mental model, keep informing what this could be until you get to a place of like, "Okay. Cool. I think we figured out what will really solve this problem in an elegant way"?

Nan Yu (00:43:42):
Yeah, and I want to really stress a nuance here, which is it's not that we want to solve the entire problem. The entire problem is quite big, but there's something that's really right for Linear to do that would help people have a good starting point for them to reason about it. So, I think a lot of building conviction around stuff is not even like do we have a workable solution? It's like how much of the problem should we actually take on? Because if we take on too much of the problem, then we'll end up overpromising and not being able to deliver on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I think what's also useful here is you all keep your team very small intentionally and being constrained keeps you from taking on these things too early because you don't have the engineers to build their designers.

Nan Yu (00:44:24):
Yeah, that's true. I actually hadn't really put that part together, but I think some of the reason we've done it this way is because we don't have the bandwidth to action everything. So, we have this backlog that we maintain to make sure that when we do take it on, we're pretty set up for success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:41):
Yeah, it's interesting. I think a lot of companies are starting to realize that they can build better products and move faster with fewer teams. I want to move in a different direction and talk a bit about how you actually think about building new products. Something that I've heard from you is that you have a systemized way of being creative, which I think is a dream for a lot of people's. It's like how do I be more creative? How do I think of new innovative concepts? You have a really interesting process for how you do this. Can you talk about it?

Nan Yu (00:45:09):
Yeah, totally. I think when people talk about being creative, a lot of times what they have a problem with is extrapolating. They can see the stuff that's right in front of them, but what about two or three steps down the line? And then it's just like, "Well, there's just so much possibility. I don't know what direction to go." So, the way that we try to do it is we ask a question which is like, "Okay, how extreme can you take it? You're designing a product. You're trying to come up with a solution. What's the most outrageous version of this along some trait?" I don't know if you guys did this at Airbnb, but I think Brian Chesky talks about like, "What's the 11-star experience?" Is that a thing you guys did?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:51):
It was a thing he talked about. Yeah, there's always a push of what's the 10X version of some idea.

Nan Yu (00:45:57):
When you think in that way, when you're saying like, "Hey, what's the 11-star experience?" What you're really asking is like, "Hey, what's the most luxurious version of this hotel stay? Or what's the most unforgettable kind of experience we can give people?" And you throw away things, I don't know, like cost. You throw away things like practicality because that's not what's interesting. What's interesting is I want to actually explore the possibility space, and I think this is really important to do because the goal is to get you to see beyond your defaults. We have all of these constraints that we're operating under that we psychically have in the back of our heads that we just don't even realize we have them. So, just break past all of them, and then you can really see what your options are because we talk about product decisions. It's like, "Oh, yeah, you have these choices. What are you going to decide?" There's all this decision-making kind of theory.

(00:46:52):
But the biggest risk is you didn't see the right choice to begin with. You have these three choices and none of them were right. It's this fourth one that was over in this corner, but you didn't look in that corner, so you never found it. So, I think the whole goal of this is to try to expand the search space of what you're trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:09):
So, what you're saying is people often don't think out of the box enough by not thinking too radically enough. So, the choices they're deciding between are just meh options and there's this process of breaking out of that, and I think you could hear this and be like, "Yeah, sure." I could spend 10 minutes being like, "Oh, hey, what's the craziest [inaudible 00:47:35]- "

Nan Yu (00:47:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
But you're saying that actually is what you do and that actually works really well?

Nan Yu (00:47:39):
Yeah, and you actually build it. You can think of a very extreme version of a product and you can say, "Hey, let's actually... " For the first version, we talked about, like the first version, you know it's not really the right answer. Sometimes, you know it's so hard because you know this is the most extreme version of the answer. So, let's build that as fast as we can and see how it feels, and then we're going to learn so much about what the right actual answer is because we have seen this area of the product space and really felt it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:05):
Awesome. Let's talk about an example of this because this feels awesome.

Nan Yu (00:48:09):
Yeah, I can talk to an example. Actually, is it okay if I demo something?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:13):
Absolutely. Let's do it. Show and tell.

Nan Yu (00:48:15):
Yeah, let me do that right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:16):
Here we go. We're going to share screen.

Nan Yu (00:48:18):
All right. So, this is just like a demo space instead of Linear. So, the feature where we did this that I remember very clearly, because it was recent, is we built this feature to save drafts for your issues. So, Linear, as hard as an issue tracker, if I make a new issue and let's say I'm trying to report a bug or something, so it's like I make a bug report, then I might start thinking through like, "Okay, what are the repro steps?" And then I start typing them, and this happens all the time. When you're at work, you're doing this and someone distracts you. If someone pings you on Slack or you have to go to a meeting or something like that, you're like, "I got to put this away for a second. I'll come back to it later." Note to self, figure out the actual repro steps and do it.

(00:48:56):
So, what can you do? Well, you want to save it as a draft. So, we're like, "Okay, this is the problem," and the first version of this, we're like, "What do we want to do? Linear is about being fast." So, we don't want to get in your way. We want to say like, "What is the fastest draft saving experience possible?" So, if you save it as draft, you can save it as draft. If you decide to not... you want to throw it away, you don't want it, just hit the X button, and it'll just throw it away. We're not going to interrupt you with a popup that says like, "Do you want to save your changes," or any of that kind of stuff. We'll just absolutely get out of your way fast as possible. So, we're like, "What's the risk here?" Well, it might feel really unsafe.

(00:49:31):
If you close this, and we don't ask you if you want to save change, you might feel like, "Oh, I just lost my changes on accident." We knew that going in. We built this anyway, and it felt super unsafe. It turns out that sort of inkling that we had was true, and we really felt exactly how unsafe it was. So, then we were like, "Okay, well, what's the safest thing we could possibly do?" The safest thing is just auto save everything. So, you start a new issue, and then you start typing some stuff, and it's just like auto saving as soon as you type a single character and that did feel quite safe. So, cool, but it also ended up leaving behind a whole bunch of like a paper trail of things you change your mind about. You've probably had this happen in document tools where you have a whole bunch of things in your space called like Untitled Document or New Document and stuff like that. It's just like-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
So many untitled folders.

Nan Yu (00:50:25):
Yeah, so many untitled folders because the moment you say new folder, it starts saving it, and then you don't actually mean for that to happen. So, we had those two sorts of variations that we built, and we fell through and where we ended up was a balance between those two. So, what happens is if I'm creating a new issue, like I am here, and I close it out, it'll interrupt me, like we have to interrupt you, otherwise it feels too unsafe. So, I can save the draft, I can go to my drafts, and then if I'm in this draft I've already made, and I go in there, and I start to say, "Okay, I'm going to keep working on it," but then I get interrupted again, then I'm just going to auto-save it for you. There's no point. I'm not going to ask you again.

(00:51:06):
I'm always going to auto save it because I'm not going to create a new object. I'm just making modifications in place. So, we made this very specific choice of on a brand new issue, we will interrupt you, and then on an existing draft that you're messing around with, we're just going to auto save everything and someone doing a analysis. If they did a detailed teardown of these decisions, they might say like, "Wow, they made very specific choices here," but the path to get there is to do something totally extreme in one direction and then totally extreme in another direction and then find where they really meet up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):
Such a good example, the way that you described it is you went like here's the safest route. Here's the fastest version. Where did you come up with these list of options? And for folks that are trying to do this for their company, are these like... Because these are Linear principles, we're going to be very fast. Is this the way you think most companies should operate these sorts of attributes? Do you think it's specific to what makes their product different? How do you think about that?

Nan Yu (00:52:04):
I think for a lot of companies, you have to ask, "What is the promise that your product or your business is making people?" It might be you always have a car available if you need it, and if you do that, then maybe we're going to have to implement search pricing to make that happen. It's always going to be available. So, here's the trade-off that we have to make. It's a very extreme point of view to do that. Or you might say the price is always predictable, but sometimes you can't have a car in the first place. Those are all choices that you get to make, and you have to sort decide, like where in that spectrum does it make sense based on the promise of your company?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:40):
A lot of people talk about this idea of working backwards. Brian Chesky in Airbnb has a big concept of working backwards from the ideal. Let's design the best possible scenario and work backwards. I love that this is even more tactical, which is just pick the extreme version of very specific attributes. Probably not that ideal, but it'll give us insight into a version of the ideal and an element that works well and then what doesn't. Yeah, exactly. I did this a lot actually at Airbnb, just like testing the extreme. So, it super resonates, this idea, and when you say test, so was it like you build it and play with it? Do you roll it out to some of these circles of users or is it often just internal, and then you learn and then iterate?

Nan Yu (00:53:23):
Yeah, we rolled out some of these versions to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:25):
Oh, wow. Okay.

Nan Yu (00:53:27):
So, the super-fast version that was unsafe, that only went interna, and everyone felt it was too unsafe, but then we thought, "Okay, let's go to the super-safe version," and then we rolled that out and everyone started having a whole bunch of... Like how many drafts are people making? I'm like, "This is too many." The people are leaving behind this crazy paper trail. Okay, we got to figure out some difference here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Awesome. So, this very much connects to your first point of get things out really quick, and in this case, it's like extreme versions. You're probably not going to work long term, but it will teach you.

Nan Yu (00:53:56):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):
Amazing. Okay, and seeing it in action, I'm like, "Okay, obviously, this is the solution," and that's how the way this should feel, and to your point, it was not an obvious solution when you started thinking about it.

Nan Yu (00:54:08):
Yeah. I mean, the best solutions are always obvious in hindsight, and it's just like you have to develop a process internally that to eventually find your way there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:16):
Something else that you've mentioned when we were chatting that connects to some of the things we've been talking about is you have this perspective that B2B software isn't just solving people's problems, it's also teaching them how to work, and it's this accumulation of information. Can you talk about that? Because I thought that was really fascinating.

Nan Yu (00:54:38):
If you think about how a lot of B2B software gets created, it's because there was some person in the middle of some giant company who implemented some kind of process, and they're like, "Wow, this process is really working for us. Maybe we should make it easier," and they build a little tool internally and then all of their colleagues can now press on buttons and good things happen, and then they turn that process and that tool. They spin it off into a startup, and they make a startup. This process repeats thousands of times. So, when you adopt that tool, you're not just adopting the actual software, you're adopting the idea that this is a practice that you ought to be doing in the first place. So, if you're a marketing person, and you adopt some marketing software, you're not just saying, "Okay, now, I can write emails and send them to people."

(00:55:24):
There's all sorts of process around that. You're organizing stuff into campaigns. You're measuring click-through rates. You're calculating cost of acquisition and all that stuff probably comes equipped with a tool because those are the right practices to do when you're doing this sort of marketing exercise. And whether you knew about it before or you learned it from the tool, like as a buyer for this kind of product, what I'm doing is I'm saying like, "Hey, I'm going to bring in this baseline level of marketing competency into my organization, that this is the worst we can do is whatever the tool defaults are."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:58):
Interesting. So, you're basically buying into a way of working when you're adopting a piece of software, not just have this problem I need solved.

Nan Yu (00:56:06):
Yeah, exactly, and I think the most salient example of this is if you've ever seen like a company adopt an ERP product, it's the most painful thing you can imagine. It's doing deep surgery. They have to redo all of their internal processes and the way they manage inventory and all this kind of stuff, but they're willing to do it because they know that this is a battle-tested way of making sure that you're actually doing good management of resources. So, they're like, "We're growing up now. It's time for us to adopt these best practices. In order to do that, we have to adopt this tool, and we will conform to whatever the tool is best is to do."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:44):
This connects to a couple things I know about Linear, one is what you've shared of just avoiding these customizations requests from people. Do you have a very opinionated way of here's how you should operate in order to build a great functioning product, org, and company in general? I'm just connecting threads here. One is like we're going to avoid letting people customize too much because we know they'll have a bad time, and then two is just this idea of we are opinionated about the way you should work in Linear, and it's like you have a Linear method, I think it's called, of just like here's how product team should operate based on everything we've seen be successful.

Nan Yu (00:57:19):
Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely connected in a way, and I think sometimes when people talk about... You mentioned like being opinionated, and I think sometimes when people talk about being opinionated, it can feel like they're almost saying like, "Hey, this is arbitrary," like your opinion and my opinion, they're just too opinions, man. Neither is right or wrong. What we try to do is find where there's actual consensus amongst a lot of different high performing teams, and then we can take those practices and say like, "Okay, for a team that isn't already practicing this, can we give them a button so that they can start practicing this?"

(00:57:56):
When we see companies doing a really good job of managing their triage queue, but it's very manual, we're like, "Okay, can we automate this? And then for this other company that really needs it that they don't know this is what they need, can we just give them a button to activate this?" And now they have the practice within their org, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:10):
So, I think the takeaway here is when you choose a tool, recognize it's going to change the way you operate and be thoughtful about is this the way we want to work versus just we just have a problem we want solved?

Nan Yu (00:58:21):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):
I want to come back to something, a thread that's come up a couple of times in our chat is the way you collaborate internally. It feels like there's a pretty unique way. You said you were on all the sales calls. Is there anything that you can share about how you collaborate internally, how the different functions collaborate that may be unlike how other companies operate that might be helpful for them to learn from?

Nan Yu (00:58:44):
Yes. Something that's worked really, really well for us is we think of product management as partially like a go-to-market discipline in the same way that sales and marketing are, right? When you talk to people and like, "Hey, tell me how product management works in your company," they'll probably say something about like, "Well, there's engineering product and design. They work in this triad, and here's how they interact and collaborate," and we all understand why that's useful, why that's helpful, but this other form of collaboration between product management, sales and marketing, I think it's something that's probably really underexamined and often I feel like in organizations, you actually see some antagonism between product and sales and marketing, and I think that's a shame because when we come together, the way we think about the way that we think about selling is a matter of like... especially because we sell to very expert practitioners, and they have a very sensitive BS detector.

(00:59:51):
So, a big part of what we try to do is we try to help our marketing team pick exactly the right word and the right phrasing to make us sound native to the language that our customers speak and also-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):
You're talking about engineers is my sense, right?

Nan Yu (01:00:07):
Yeah. Engineers is a big one, but even product managers, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:08):
Mm-hmm.

Nan Yu (01:00:10):
Like product managers know when... They know what the job is like. So, when you come in, you say the wrong words, people give you stink eye.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Don't call them project managers.

Nan Yu (01:00:19):
Yeah, exactly, for example. So, I think that's a big part of what we have to do. So, on our PM team, we actually have a full-time product marketer, and her job is to... Tactically, it's like all the change logs come from her, all the release notes, and also she's always crafting the language for whatever upcoming release that we're building and working directly with the teams and trying to figure out how to talk about it, and then once we go out and build the campaigns, build assets and things like that, that's where a lot of the language is coming from. It's coming from the work that she's doing and then with sales, they're validating all that message in the field. They're saying the words to customers directly and telling you if it's sticking or not, and then you can have a really good feedback cycle between those three disciplines.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):
What I've seen you refer to this way of working as is a double triangle, which is I think a complement to the PM, engineer, designer. Talk about that and give us a visual of what that looks like.

Nan Yu (01:01:18):
Yeah, I think PMs, like product managers, we often have a tough time trying to explain like, "What is your job?" It's a little bit of everything. I think the job that I do that we see it as is you're taking the building side of the organization and the selling side of the organization and bringing it together. You're taking all of the commercial motivations and goals of the company and making sure that what you build actually solves for those goals, and you're tempering that with what's possible and where the opportunities are to actually build stuff. So, to me, it's the PM in the middle, and then you have engineering, product design, and then sales, marketing, product management on the other side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
PM is always in the middle-

Nan Yu (01:02:05):
Indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:06):
... but I think that's true from the perspective of PM, and I love this visual of just the PM is connecting the builders to the sellers, and you're involved in both worlds. This connects very directly to Brian Chesky's whole thing about how PMs should be doing marketing. So, the way they changed it, every PM is also PMM, and there's no more... They're product marketers now. That's their title and that's like the extreme version of what you're describing. 

Nan Yu (01:02:33):
Yeah. Yeah, and I think Apple's been doing that way for forever, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):
Got it. So, the advice here is if you're a PM at a B2B business, lean into the sales and marketing side of it, lean into the go-to-market.

Nan Yu (01:02:45):
Yeah, and in fact, if you're leaving something on the table in terms of the kind of impact that you are having at your job, that's probably the thing that you're leaving on the table. You're probably already doing a good job of collaborating with engineering and design. It's probably the sort of sell side that there's an opportunity for you to have more impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
Just to make it even more concrete for PMs that are like, "Okay, I want to do this. I want to do what Linear's doing. I'm going to get more salesy." What does it look like when someone is more is in this double triangle working more closely with sales? You talked about being on sales calls. What else there can you share of just like, "Here, try these things"?

Nan Yu (01:03:20):
I think originate the message that you send to your audience. There's a lot of things that marketing does, which you are never going to necessarily touch. There's always demand gen and figuring out channel strategy and all this kind of stuff, like sure. That's a peer marketing concern, but actually picking the words and where the emphasis is, like you should understand the customer at a pretty deep level, probably deeper than any other group at the company because of the kinds of requirements gathering, discovery that you're doing. So, you're going to know the native language that your customers speak a lot better and help your marketing team originate those words.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Got it. So, basically be really involved in the product marketing, the writing, the emails, the headlines, the website?

Nan Yu (01:04:06):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. I know the word product marketing is also so overloaded. They do so many different things, but it's that sort of content creation piece that you really have an opportunity to contributes to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:16):
Yeah, I love how concrete that is. It's like don't think about this concept, product marketing. Just think about the words that your potential customers and customers see. Okay, final area I want to spend a lot of time on is totally different. It's around getting a job. 

Nan Yu (01:04:31):
Oh, yeah. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
You have a pretty unique approach to finding a gig. I heard from the founder of Mode about the very unique way you approached getting a job there. I imagine Linear is a similar boat. What advice can you share with folks that are looking for a job, maybe struggling, that work for you when you were looking for your next gig?

Nan Yu (01:04:51):
Project management is a unique role. Because we do just about everything, you don't really get pigeonholed into being compared along a single dimension with everyone else, and everyone who's hiring PMs, just like when they're hiring execs, they're hoping that they bring them on to solve some burning problem that they have. So, it's your job when you're in the interview process to figure out what that burning problem is. So, put on your discovery hat and go figure out what is the actual job to be done of the hiring manager when they're bringing on a new PM onto their team? And if you can do that and then make a good case that you are the person to solve that problem, then hiring you becomes a binary choice between do I hire the solution to my problem or do I hire someone else?

(01:05:48):
And I think what ends up happening a lot is when you're in a interview process, you're just trying to put your best foot forward, trying to say that you're great at everything. You have very few weaknesses. Maybe you tried too hard, like whatever, but everyone's going to say that. So, you're just one of end people, and you want to make yourself a little bit of just you versus the field. You're the solution to a problem and then everyone else is like a roll of the dice. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:15):
So, the way you're describing it is the company has a job to be done, say it's drive growth of some feature. In this case, it's like for Linear, just build a killer or successful B2B product. I don't know. That's a broad one. Usually, you're not interviewing for head of product role, so that's maybe too broad. So, it's like what is this PM role's job to be done at the company and then help convince them you are the best person to do that job and solve this problem for them.

Nan Yu (01:06:42):
Yeah, and a lot of times when you take that approach, it'll feel like you already work there, and the way that I did this, like I got advice from a friend. He said like, "I was interviewing for this job at Mode that you referenced." I'm like, "How should I approach it?" He's like, "Just act like you already worked there. What would you do?" And then it's like, "Okay, I could do that." So, then when you're in this interview process and someone's asking you questions. He goes, "Do you have any questions for me?" You can ask them like, "What are your OKRs this quarter? How can someone help you achieve those?" You can be that specific about it, and they're like, "Oh, yeah, sure. I can tell you about the exact thing that I'm doing this quarter, and then you'll have some level of intelligence about what people are actually trying to solve because I think often we just get stuck in these very high level general types of questions like, "What's the company goals sand all that kind of stuff, and it's like, no, you can get really specific. If you were collaborating with that person in your job, what would you say to them?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):
I love how actionable this advice is. There's obviously an element of this takes work and time. A lot of people are interviewing at a lot of companies, trying to find a job, is part of your advice. Pick the ones you're most excited about and invest a lot of time in this way of interviewing.

Nan Yu (01:07:58):
You can invest a lot in the ones where you know that you're going to be able to over deliver on. If you understand what they're actually trying to solve, then you know where you're going to have both the highest chance of success of getting hired, but also doing a really great job on the other end of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
And you talk about how you're like pretending you have the job, pretending you actually have this job as part of the interview process. Oftentimes, as an outsider, you don't have enough information to have a really good thought on what the solution is, and maybe part of it is going to be so wrong because you're like, "I don't actually know. I don't have the data." Do you actually try to reach out to the engineers and designers on the team to try to understand things? How far do you go to try to solve these problems and show them what you can do?

Nan Yu (01:08:37):
Yeah, I mean, you're in the interview loop. These are people that you're going to be working closely with. So, start there. Do your discovery questions, and if there's an area that you think you want to dig, you can ask. There's no harm asking, "Hey, can you put me in touch with an engineering manager who's working on the same problem?" And if no one else is asking, again, you're going to have an extra piece of feedback from that eng manager. So, yeah, like this guy asks really good questions, and it seems like they're really with it. No one else is going to have that piece of feedback. So, during the debrief process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:08):
And just asking that question alone will show them how deeply you're thinking about this already?

Nan Yu (01:09:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Amazing. Nan, is there anything else that we have not covered that you want to touch on or share or you think might be helpful to listeners before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Nan Yu (01:09:30):
I have a very specific point of view on deadlines. I don't know if that's [inaudible 01:09:34] you care.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:34):
Let's do it. Fire away.

Nan Yu (01:09:38):
I think what often happens is people get depressed about deadlines. It's like, "Hey, here's the ship date," and then you never make it. I don't know if you've had this feeling before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):
Absolutely, with some deadlines.

Nan Yu (01:09:49):
You were an engineer before too, right? So, it's just like engineers is basically like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, deadlines, they're complete fabrications," and the only way to make deadlines real is to take them so seriously that they are basically like a P0 problem, and everything else has to not matter in comparison to the deadline because that's the only way you're going to be able to signal to the team and also to all the stakeholders that you're actually taking it seriously. So, my feeling on deadlines is don't have too many of them, and when you do, it's a P0. So, the engineer is working on it. They don't get to work on anything else.

(01:10:28):
It's like, "Oh, I need them for this," like nope. Nope. You're not pulling them off of anything. We're doing this. As a PM, your job is to just cut as much scope as possible to make it possible to hit that deadline. Like what are the things actually blocking us from doing it? Because what you want to do is at the moment where you have to make the go, no-go call on whether to ship, you want to be able to actually have a product that you can say yes to. It might not have all the features you had wanted or whatever, and you can say no. You can make that choice, but you want to set yourself up to be in a position where you can actually say yes or no to something, because what often happens is like we want this thing. Well, it's not even close to being done yet, so there's no possible way we can say yes. I can't ship it. It's half broken. It's like, "No, no, no. You want to get to a point where it works. It might not be the product that you want, but it is an actual real product that you can conceivably ship."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):
So, you said that don't have too many deadlines, but when you do, make sure you... Everyone understands these are actual deadlines. When do you decide it's worth having a deadline? Is it like a marketing launch sort of thing? What's worthy of a deadline in your experience?

Nan Yu (01:11:32):
Yeah, it's usually having to do with some kind of external marketing type of exercise that you're try to hit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):
Got it.

Nan Yu (01:11:39):
And I think that that's the other thing that I think. As builders, we can often look at launch dates and stuff like that. It's like, "Oh, who cares if it's a little bit later or we skip this change log," or whatever it is, and I think that that's really a... I don't know. It makes me go crazy when I hear people say that in all honesty. With marketing and communication with customers, you basically have a limited amount of opportunities to do so. A year is 365 days. There are 12 months. Each of those months has about four weeks. There's some rhythm where you get to have 50-ish weeks to say something to your audience once a week, or you get to have 12 months to say something really big or four quarters to say something huge. If you miss one of those opportunities, you don't get it back again. You can't time travel back and say like, "Okay, actually, let's redo first quarter and say this message that we wish we could have gotten into the field."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:35):
That is such a powerful point. I could see the sales marketing, go-to-market element of your job coming out there. I imagine everyone that's in that field's like, "Yes, this is exactly right." Maybe just the last question along this line. So, I love this idea of taking deadlines very seriously when you commit to a deadline. At the same time, as you pointed out, it creates a lot of stress knowing there's a deadline we have to hit. So, one lever you've mentioned is cutting scope. Another is just people spending more time estimating to have more accurate deadlines. You invest in that. How do you think about just for an engineering team to come into a deadline, how much to spend on de-risking and estimating versus just, "Let's just do our best and then we'll cut and adjust"?

Nan Yu (01:13:18):
This might be my hot take, but we do almost no estimating in order to hit deadlines. What we do is we ship as early as we can. The thing we talked about earlier where if by the time that 10% of the time has elapsed, you have a working thing, you can now spend the rest of the time deciding whether or not you want to do another iteration or you want to polish that thing and get it to be a shippable state. So, you're setting up your future self to be able to make that decision. So, none of this is... You can't go into this at the very last moment and say like, "Okay, now, we have to take the deadline seriously." You have to do it from the beginning and commit to the process of going very fast, iterating early, and then putting yourself in a position where you can say yes or no to a product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):
So interesting and so different from the way most companies operate. Nan, this was everything I was hoping it'd be. I think this is going to help a lot of people build much better product, which would be good for the world if more products are like Linear. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nan Yu (01:14:20):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:20):
Okay, let's do it. Okay, first question. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Nan Yu (01:14:29):
I think the one book that I recommend the most is The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. I read it originally in college for an HCI class I was taking, and I think of everything I've ever read, it's the thing that caused me to see the world from the perspective of everything you interact with as a product. Every pencil that you use, every door that you open is a product that somebody designed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):
And is that the big takeaway from that book? Because it comes up a lot, and it's such an old book. So, I guess for someone that hasn't read or maybe doesn't have time to read, it is the big takeaway for you. Someone designed everything and there's a reason things aren't great, and they can be improved.

Nan Yu (01:15:10):
Yeah. I mean, I saw this the other day. I was at a café in my neighborhood, and I saw a kid rip a handle off a door, like of the café. He pulled it so hard, it came right off because it was a push door, but it had a handle that looked like you could pull it, and that's one of the canonical examples of the book because [inaudible 01:15:25] are just mysteries. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Awesome. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Nan Yu (01:15:33):
I watched The Diplomat on Netflix. I think it was terrific. It's really fun, easy watch. It has some West Wing vibes if you were into that back in the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:44):
Yeah, have you seen the second season?

Nan Yu (01:15:46):
Yeah, I finished the second season. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
I wasn't as excited about the second season, just to put that out there. The first season was really good and then just went off a little like, "Okay. I guess it's cool," but stuff like that.

Nan Yu (01:15:55):
Yeah, it got a little like spy thrillery, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):
Okay, cool, but still really good and on Netflix. Okay, cool. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Nan Yu (01:16:06):
I didn't discover it, but I discovered a version of it that was really interesting. There's a pen. Actually, I have one on my desk. It's called the Sakura Micron. I don't know if you use these. It's like a felt tip pen. It's really great. It was originally invented in Japan for artists to draw comic books and stuff, and you can use it for anything. I use it for journaling or whatever, but I was on Amazon. I was trying to buy more, and I found a package that said like, "Bible Study Kit." I was like, "Why is this labeled Bible Study Kit?" And it was literally just the pen in four different colors, and it was because the thing doesn't bleed through pages. So, if you have a Bible, which they often have these really flimsy newsprint pages. It's not going to bleed through.

(01:16:51):
And it's just really interesting to me that someone marketed a normal package of these pens as a Bible study kit and for people who were looking for that keyword, and it was official, too. It was not something hacked together. It was actually an official packaging of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):
Amazing. What a unique pen choice. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Nan Yu (01:17:15):
The correct amount is too much minus one, and I think this ties into the try the extreme version of it of a thing where... I don't know, like a stupid example, like how much pizza do you want to eat? It's like, well, five slices was too many. I feel bad. Then four was probably the right number, and then if you want to find the right number, sometimes you just have to really shoot for the edge and then find out what's too much, and then you'll find out exactly what the right amount is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:41):
I love how tactical that is, makes me think about Elon Musk's thing about cutting things. Like one of his formulas for just getting stuff done, one of them is just cut stuff before trying to optimize it and automate it, and his advice is if you don't bring back 10% of things, you cut, you're not cutting enough.

Nan Yu (01:17:59):
Yeah, exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):
Final question. You worked at Everlane for a number of years, and you shared the rough idea of a story around a shirt, maybe a bestseller that they have now, and how you helped create a bestselling women's shirt. Can you share that story?

Nan Yu (01:18:19):
Yeah. So, I mean, to be clear, I witnessed the creation. I don't think I had a direct hand in it, but yeah. So, I saw this advertisement the other day on Instagram for... It's called the Women's Box-Cut Tee, and it's a wide and short for women, and I looked, and it had 20 colors of it, and it sells super well, and I remember when we created this thing, and it was because there was a batch of defective men's t-shirts. They all came in an inch and a half too short. So, we couldn't sell them. You would have your belly button sticking out. No one wants to wear of that. So, what we did was like, well, we have to salvage the inventory because we were a very small company, and we had to make cash flow, and we couldn't just damage it out.

(01:19:06):
So, the design team and the marketing team came together, and they said, "Okay. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to cut another two inches off of this and make it really cropped and market it towards women as like a cropped boxed-tee silhouette, and we did that. We're like, "Okay, hopefully, we can salvage this inventory and not have to take a write-down." It sold out in a week, and we're like, "Oh, okay. I guess we just made a hit product," and it's one of these things where it's very hard to know what this was. Was this a marketing thing? Was this a design thing? I don't know, but you just come together, and you find the right product market fit in the weirdest way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:43):
I love that it's still going.

Nan Yu (01:19:43):
Yeah, it's still going. Originally, it was just white. Now, there's like 20 colors.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:48):
Oh, man. I love how many industries you have worked in: fashion, data analytics, project management. I don't know what's next. There's more, I imagine. Nan, this was incredible. I really appreciate making time for this. Like I said, I think we're going to have helped a lot of people build better products. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Nan Yu (01:20:08):
Yeah, I'm on X/Twitter as the thenanyu. It's T-H-E and then my name, and if they have any feedback about Linear, we're very happy to take it, especially for people who use it in their day-to-day. We really want to hear from users.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
What's the best way for them to share that? Is it tweet at you? Is it go to the website? What do you recommend?

Nan Yu (01:20:31):
Oh, yeah. You can tweet at us. You can DM me on Twitter. My DMs are open, so it's all good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
Amazing. Nan, thank you so much for being here. 

Nan Yu (01:20:39):
Yeah, of course. Thanks, Lenny.

A lot of people think that the only time you really need to present well is when you have a big stage talk and you make the big investment in the script. The big investment in the contrasting story. I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, like literally it works. It works in any format.

Lenny (00:00:29):

Nancy Duarte (00:03:31):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:33):
How many presentations have you helped craft at this point, both directly and indirectly?

Nancy Duarte (00:03:38):
That's a great question. People know I'll like take a swag at data and pretend it's real. So, I had a president who took us a whack at that number in, it was 2014, and he said at that time it was 225,000, and that was almost 10 years ago, so I can't even tell you, I mean we stopped tracking, but it's a lot. I mean, in 35 years we have thousands of projects we open and each sometimes has two to a hundred presentations in it, so it'd be hard to tell.

Lenny (00:04:13):
200,000.

Nancy Duarte (00:04:15):
He said 250,000, but that was 10 years ago and I didn't do the math. So, when my team questioned it, I'm like, oh, Dan did the math. They're like, "Oh, then it's accurate." Because they thought I was just making up this number. I'm like, no, no, we actually went in and looked.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Okay. I was not expecting it to be that large. That's insane.

Nancy Duarte (00:04:34):
It's so funny because I have the whole history of the Silicon Valley in a way. It's like every little startup and then they grew to massive brands like Cisco and you could actually look at the rise and fall of all these companies. And then I actually have all the decks. I still have a lot of these archives, so I could actually verify that number exactly.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Okay, well this next question's going to be extra hard then. Of all the presentations you've worked on, which one stands out to you as the most memorable or most impactful?

Nancy Duarte (00:05:02):
I mean, it has to be Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth. It kind of hit the world in a season where nobody really knew or had an example of a really well done presentation. So, it came out before TED Talks were even out on the web, and so people had never seen someone tell a data story and stand in front of data and the scale in 90 foot screen, but we had worked with him for five years before an Inconvenient Truth. People think he went from vice president to this presenter and I didn't work with him. I let my team work with him. So, they were the ones jetting around jumping backstage at Oprah. They loved it. It was a real peak season.

(00:05:40):
But the thing actually that was most memorable is we work with these 20 some year old CEOs here in the Valley and they tend to show up and act like they know better than someone who's been doing this for so long. And what was so interesting about this large figure politician communicator is the team would sit in a room and say, "Hey, we think you need to do this way. We think you needed to convey it this way. We think it should be visualized this way." Or whatever it was we were proposing. And he would literally pause and touch his chin and really think, and really consider that we might actually be experts.

(00:06:18):
And more times than not he would adopt the way we said it should be done. And so I think as the customer who actually probably had some of the most power in the whole world to thoughtfully defer to us as experts was delightful customer and consulting experience. I mean, I remember when they called me to say it was going to become a movie and that it had gotten funded and I started to get the information. They wanted us to do a lot of work to get it movie ready. And I'll never forget, I said, "Wow, that's going to be a lot of work we'd have to do for free, and who's going to go see a movie about a slideshow anyway?" That's literally what I said. So, yeah, I just didn't believe it would become what it became. So, the whole process was amazing.

Lenny (00:07:05):
Did you expect the impact of what happened after that presentation or was it just like, oh, we got this one job we got to do, let's just get through it and then move on?

Nancy Duarte (00:07:14):
Well, we've been doing it for five years. I think the strategy, whether it was intentional or not, I don't know. So, he would go city to city to city, because he was traveling for five years seeding, like planting seeds for a groundswell, and he went into, he would go to the Stanford campus invite the Bay Area Elite, and it was always private and it was always VIP. And so he did a really good job for five years, traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling and really delivering that talk. And I think that created a desire. I don't know that it would've gotten that much traction. I don't know if people already didn't know about the presentation and hadn't already seen the presentation and they brought their friends to the movie, is how I kind of picture at least that part happening.

(00:07:59):
And he was generous, Lenny. I mean, at the end, when he traveled around for those five years at the end, he always had a slide with our name on it and would thank us if you're in the audience. I mean, super, and paid, mostly paid for what we did that we did give a lot of our own time. But yeah, super generous and yeah, movie became what it was. It was a bit of a surprise. It was good. The movie was good.

Lenny (00:08:24):
It was good. It also makes me think about a pattern that I often see of it wasn't just one presentation that changed everything. It was, you said five years of prep ahead of that, and you always see these wow overnight success stories and you always find, okay, it wasn't actually that.

Nancy Duarte (00:08:42):
Yeah, and he did a good job after, once it got traction, we built a whole training program where he could fly people out to his place in Tennessee and start to train people. So, it almost became a train the trainer and he could sanction you as a ambassador for it. So, it was just the way the whole thing kind of unfolded and scaled and then got traction was lovely.

Lenny (00:09:03):
Speaking of impressive clients, I only learned this recently, but Apple has been a client of yours since the day you were founded as an organization. Is that right?

Nancy Duarte (00:09:12):
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Okay. How did you land that initially? And then also just what have you learned from that experience that's informed your approach to presentation, design, communication, and how you work with clients?

Nancy Duarte (00:09:22):
I love that question. So, yeah, I had a real job. I was working my real job and my husband had bought a Mac and he's like, "I think this is a business. I think it could be a real business." And he was an illustrator, wasn't a designer, but he had been a fine artist. And he's like, "Look, I can draw." Of course it's all pixelated and bit mappy. He goes, "Look, I could draw lines in here." And if I could show you his art studio, his work is just gorgeous. So, he's definitely a fine artist. And he's like, "I think this is a business. I think this could be a business." And I'm very pregnant. We were talking about that earlier. I am very pregnant with my son and I'm like, "Dude, you're going to go get yourself a real job. I don't want you playing around with this little Mac thing."

(00:10:02):
And he begged me twice in our marriage. He literally has gotten on his knees and to try to get me to see his perspective begged me. He's like, "Just read a Mac World magazine, just read it through once, and if you still don't think this could become a thing ..." Because I was working on a mainframe, I'm like, I work on a real computer. So, what happened was I made some phone calls. I called NASA and I called Tandem, which is now HP, and I called Apple and we won contracts at all three brands at the same time. And back then our company was called Duarte Desktop Publishing and Graphic Design.

Lenny (00:10:36):
Oh, wow.

Nancy Duarte (00:10:37):
I know, I know. And we slipped in. When you talk about a product lifecycle, very early, everything was still bit mappy, was not attractive. Most people as users didn't know how to typeset, didn't know how to do columns, didn't know how to make in this tool at all. And there's about an 18 month window in the life cycle of the Macintosh where graphic designers refused to use it, refused. It's a toy, it's ugly, it's bit mapped. Nobody would do it, a font like that. We use Linotype. It was very, the snobby kind of, we won't touch it. And that's right when we entered right then went and checked out books at the library on type setting, we tried to figure out what we could do, what could we do with this tool, and then the rest was kind of history. And so that's how it started and the timing and just kind of pushing the tool that nobody was that interested in that we're in the design community. It was small adoption.

Lenny (00:11:36):
So, that's interesting that it was cold emails basically are cold reach out just like, "Hey, we want to work with you." Yeah, that's an awesome [inaudible 00:11:42]-

Nancy Duarte (00:11:42):
Cold calling. Cold calling, yeah, it was.

Lenny (00:11:45):
What did you take away from that experience that kind of informed what works and doesn't work in presentations?

Nancy Duarte (00:11:51):
Presentations used to be 35 millimeter slides in an old carousel. In fact, that's what Al Gore had when he showed, he was like, here's my slide carousel from the seventies. It was just how it was done. But Apple was the first company to hook up the computer to a projector at scale. Now the projectors at these big venues like San Jose Convention Center, I mean it was huge and it was risky. So, because we were first in, they pushed us to start to do the presentations in this tool and it was black and white. Everything was black and white when we first started. And then we started to push and push and push from how we illustrated things in the tool, how we would colorize clip art. I mean, I'm talking like clip art packages just came out and they're like, "Hey, grab these, colorize them."

(00:12:32):
And so it was a really momentous moment to win them as an account. And I remember the tool had started to really take off and it was ugly. You can call it fugly, I don't know what you want to call it, but everyone who made slides did it so poorly, just so poorly. And we were kind of pushing the boundaries of it to make it look attractive. And there was a sales conference in 1992 in San Francisco and the leader of sales at the time was kind of a creative savant of sorts. And I remember he's like, "I don't know how you're going to do it, but I want you to take the whole slide." This is when slides were basically teleprompted covered in text. If you could stick a piece of clip art on it, you were lucky. And he said, "I want you to just make the whole slide, it's just covered with the word big in hot pink. And I want the background black, because when this slide pops up in all pink big, I want it to actually light the faces of the people in the audience."

(00:13:26):
And it was like I didn't know how to, we couldn't do that. We had to go into free hand, convert it to this, do these six steps, and then we came up with a small JPEG at the time or png or something and we scaled it up. So, it was still kind of pixelated. And I remember I was in that hall during the rehearsal and the production team gasped. Couple people squealed. They're like, "Who did this? I mean, it was just the word big in magenta pink." And I just remember thinking, this is how it's supposed to be done. Putting the tool in the hands of the masses kind of destroyed the medium itself.

(00:13:58):
And I feel like the first 10 or so years I was in business, it was reshaping this medium that ran amuck when it got into the hands of the users, it just went completely the opposite way that it was supposed to. So, it's weird to say that was a real defining moment for me to say, wait, we can do this different and we can return to how they used to be done when they were 35 millimeter slides. So, that's one story. And then I think we're very good at mapping to the brand requirements. So, we take this tool, whatever the tool, we have all our brands use different ones. They use Slides, Keynote, they use PowerPoint. We use whatever tool the brand wants and we push it in each medium. But we take their brand guidelines and really push it into the spoken word medium where when they stand up on a stage, it's cinematic. The visuals can become an experience in itself.

(00:14:57):
And I remember when Apple came up with the Think Different campaign. Steve Jobs was just back and my designer, everyone Photoshop was new. And everyone's doing these beveled backgrounds with tons of crap on the background. And I walked by, I'm like, "No, oh, we can't have a blue frame looking photo frame to for the Think Different campaign. This is not going to work." And so I remember looking at all the posters and remembering the Alfred Hitchcock ones. It had these particulates like these particulates, and it was just shadows.

(00:15:34):
And I found a stock video that Adobe had made at the time, and it was just particulates floating through the air at the angle and we stuck the six color apple on top of it. That was so revolutionary back there to push the brand and get out of the way every, the whole world was making these hideous templates. So, there are these moments that pushed the company forward because of an idea that I knew would not be okay for the Apple brand, therefore it shouldn't be okay for any brand. And I think those are just a couple stories of how to really push the medium in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. The audience just likes it better when it's really clear what you're supposed to focus on. We love that brand. We love it.

Lenny (00:16:22):
Okay, so let's get a little tactical, because you're talking about some very specific things that you've found to be working. So, everyone listening to this podcast has probably heard many times it's really important to be great at presentations that there's so much power in storytelling and communication, all these things. And they probably read a bunch of books and blog posts and watch videos of how to give a great presentation. But myself, and I feel like most people sit down at a deck when they're about to present to an all hand, say a week later or are going to do a meeting. And I'm always just like, okay, what do I do? Okay, there's like a beginning, middle end, they should have some kind of problem. And it's always like, I don't know what I'm doing. So, if someone were to just be listening to this podcast and they're like, I'm going to write a post-it to myself of three bullet points of things that I should remember when I'm starting a deck, what are those three bullet points?

Nancy Duarte (00:17:11):
Your audience is the hero. That was in my TED talk from 2011. I would say it's infuse your talk with story. And I would say it is asking yourself, can they see what I'm saying? Those would be the three tips other than starting with empathy. I mean that that's, well, audience is the hero, is the empathy centric approach.

Lenny (00:17:33):
Let's dive into these then. And I was actually going to ask around empathy, and it feels like that comes up a lot in your recommendations to people's empathy is kind of the heart of your methodology of telling great stories, telling great presentations. So, let's spend a little time there. Why is that so important and what does that actually look like in practice?

Nancy Duarte (00:17:50):
Empathy is important to Duarte, everything we do is empathy first. And some of it comes from my own childhood story a little bit. I was raised by a clinically narcissistic mom and narcissist are missing the empathy gene. So, I feel like that void of not having it modeled for me is why I keep clawing at empathy as being important. And I think a lot of people listening might work for a boss that does not have empathy, that isn't other centric, that doesn't think before they talk and all of those things. And I was raised by someone like that. And so every single book and every single model that I ever make has empathy at the core because you have to have to think about who am I speaking with, especially in communication, who am I speaking with? And so when I went on my journey through storytelling, I figured out that I thought, okay, the presenter's the hero, for sure the presenter's the hero, they're the central figure. They're talking the most. They're well lit, they're up on a stage.

(00:18:48):
So, when I started to look at all the archetypes, that's where I landed. And then I was like, oh my god. When I got to really digging into the mentor, I realized it's really the mentor in myths and movies that's the presenter and who really holds the power in the room of a presentation is the audience, the audience gets to make a choice if they accept or reject your idea. So, the balance of power is with them and not you. So, it really is the role of the presenter to be the mentor. And in myths and movies, the mentor comes alongside the hero. In other words, the presenter should come alongside the audience and help them get unstuck or bring a magical tool. So, I think Obi Won Kenobi's a great example.

(00:19:32):
He did two things for Luke Skywalker. He gave him a light saber, which was for his outer journey, the physical journey he was doing, and then an inner tool, which was the resolve, which came to him through the force. So, when you're speaking to an audience, they're going to have an internal conflict that you have to give them something to soothe. And then you're asking them to therefore go and do this thing, take this action, do this call to action. That's asking them to physically do something or physically change in some way. So, they're not going to do that for you if you haven't empathetically thought about how hard what you're asking them is going to be for them to do. And so you have to change your mindset when you're starting to build your deck to think about who am I talking to? How am I going to help them get unstuck? And that's just a super foundational principle in everything we do.

Lenny (00:20:29):
What is an example of that in practice as we go through these? Because this is really great of that implemented the deck that we know about maybe?

Nancy Duarte (00:20:38):
Oh, that we know about. So, I could talk about our own internal ones. Most of what we do is under MSAs because they're fantastical brands. So, in my own company, before I do a presentation that's going to require goals or them reaching goals or we do an annual vision talk, we do a listening tour first. So, some of it's based in survey, some of it's based in interviews. And we feed that information up and then we compare it to what we're going to ask them to do. And we do some gap analysis. We literally, there's some actual questions you can ask yourself, which are somewhat classic design thinking kind of questions about where they're at. And then what we do is I create a real rough cut or the exec team creates a real rough cut and then we invite the next level of leaders in and we do a fake, I mean the slides are ugly, we don't spend time on the slides.

(00:21:31):
This is about the message and maybe a model or two or three that we're going to go through to feel like it may amplify or make the message more concrete. And then they get feedback and that's when it's hard. It's hard to go from rough cut, here's what we're going to say to making it absolutely resonate. And then we deliver it after all of that work has been done, then we share it to the company. So, we go through that knowing that's the hardest presentation I deliver all year. I used to travel and speak and be a public speaker, but it's my own internal ones I have to take more time with.

(00:22:05):
So, when I travel and speak, they're like, oh my God, I love your models. Oh my gosh, can I get a picture with you? But when I'm standing in front of my own team, they're like, I wonder what she's going to say, because she's about to either make my job harder or she's going to change my priorities. They come in more skeptical. And we definitely have nailed the annual kickoff meeting. Definitely have nailed that. And then we do quarterly updates to that annual kickoff meeting. And it's a cadence and people get enthused and we're kind of killing it right now.

Lenny (00:22:40):
Yeah, that's what it feels like from the outside. I'm just thinking about the pressure to create presentations within Duarte Design. If you think about your job as hard, creating a deck for your company, imagine that.

Nancy Duarte (00:22:52):
Presentations in front of presentation experts is like-

Lenny (00:22:55):
Oh my god.

Nancy Duarte (00:22:56):
And I get nervous. I get really nervous because I have one slide that's kind of flawed or I say um or I pace too much. You lose a third of your team each time. They're such experts. So, it's hard.

Lenny (00:23:10):
I want to walk through these three bullet points. So, the first is make the listener the hero of your story. And that comes from being empathetic and understanding their challenge. So, if you're trying to do that, what are signs that you're doing it well or not well? Is there the way the flow of the story start? Is it the here's the way it starts? Or what should people identify of I'm doing this well or I'm not doing this well?

Nancy Duarte (00:23:31):
If the audience is the hero, you would see visible signs that they get it. People would come before I did a really good talk and people were tweeting saying, "Hey, come to this talk. It's really good." So, you'd see a reaction. You know you've done it well if you're infusing your talk with story, which is the second bullet by utilizing story structures. So, when I say storytelling, I'm talking about an anecdote. When I say story structures, I'm talking about this format of a three act structure of storytelling that goes back tens of thousands of years, which is fused into the brain like FMRI machines now you can see them while a story's being told and the science is beautiful, if you're telling me a story and I'm listening, our brains are firing in the exact same order, in the exact same place. So, it has power to align our brains.

(00:24:26):
And so by implementing attributes of story like a beginning, a middle, and an end, and we have method for that. And in also incorporating the rise and fall story kind of builds tension and releases it. And that's why we love it so much is we escape through someone else's messy middle and conflict and problems like it's messy and then it resolves. You build the tension and resolve it. And that's what a really well structured presentation can do. It can pull on that rise and fall in a way that creates longing.

(00:24:58):
So, story creates longing. It helps people long for something they'd never wanted before because if the future is told in the shape of a story and they see this alternate future, so many people escape through sci-fi. They escape through movie making into these future worlds. And so picture that you could verbally paint a picture of this future state and then you could bring your whole audience to this future state in an amazing way using this cadence of rise and fall. That's how you can incorporate story into a presentation where you need to influence others, actually really can be beautiful when it's done well.

Lenny (00:25:38):
And so you gave a TEDx Talk on this exact topic. And so I want to go deeper here. And you kind of shared this very visual way of thinking about a great story where it kind of goes up and down and up and down these teeth almost. Can you actually talk about-

Nancy Duarte (00:25:51):
[inaudible 00:25:51] pumpkin teeth. Yeah, it does.

Lenny (00:25:54):
Can you share what that structure visually looks like? And we'll share a link in the show notes of what that actually looks like and then just why that is so impactful and important.

Nancy Duarte (00:26:02):
Yeah, I love that. So, I went on a three year journey through story and I knew that the greatest speeches overall time did have that rise and fall and rise and fall. But it wasn't one single story. It had a whole lot of other very important information, but it still did this rise and fall and risen fall. So, I am not a digital native. I took a quarter inch graph paper and I would listen to all kinds and map out, took the words. When I analyzed Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech, I did it all by hand. I wrote every word I did quarter inch graph paper. I needed to know, I needed to see it the way I work, which was analog. And so at first it was zigzaggy and I realized, wait, you can't map something over time and have it be a zigzag.

(00:26:49):
There was too much data lost. So, to verbally describe it, you could picture a line at the bottom of your screen and that line going left to is what is. And you need to set up every talk by stating what is. And then it moves straight up and you move to what could be come back down to the bottom line again say what is, back up, what could be, what is, what could be, what is, what could be? And then at the last what could be you state the last horizontal line is what we call the new bliss. So, this motion of traversing between what is, what could be, what's is, what could be, what is, what could be, that sense of longing for the future, it makes people leave their current state or the status quo or our current reality and makes them long for this future state by using contrast.

(00:27:37):
So, that rise and fall of hey, here's our current problem, here's a solution, or here's the state of the union. But we imagine it could look like this. There's so many different ways to build that cadence of contrast that's so lovely. I mean it really works. I think the talk came out in 2011 and the amounts of notes and emails of things people have accomplished by changing the structure of their presentation has been really astounding.

Lenny (00:28:09):
The State of the Union is a really interesting example because I'm trying to imagine this and presentations I've seen and that totally resonates of just like, here's the problem we're having and here's where we're going to go. Here's another problem we're having. Here's what I'm going to change.

Nancy Duarte (00:28:20):
Steve Jobs was great at that. When he launched the iPhone speech, he always did, here's the state of the company, here's how we're doing. Oh my God, our stores are more full than 10 Mac world expos. He always did a setup of what was going on. And then he did a really rapid what is, what could be when he started to compare the iPhone to the Blackberry. It's like, look how much it sucks now that you've seen what we're doing. It's just what is, what could be, what is, what could be. And so I took all the classic speeches, historical speeches, everything, presidential speeches and knew that if I could find a pattern in Dr. King and Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech that was the same, that had the same type of nature of cadence and pulsing to it, for lack of a better word, that I knew I had solved it using story. It was a really great moment to finally draw that out on my quarter inch graph paper.

Lenny (00:29:19):
I love that.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:19):
It was awesome.

Lenny (00:29:22):
I feel like there's just so much opportunity for primary research that still I feel like that's why my newsletter does well is I just spent the time doing that work that you're describing of watching a thousand interviews and then just distilling, here's a takeaway here.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:34):
Pattern finding, that's an interesting point. I worry sometimes with the emergence of new technologies and stuff, the ability to be able to sit and think, synthesize and all of that is because a human's going to come up with different insights and synthesis than any future machine can do. So, I think it's fascinating that you do that so well and it really shows that.

Lenny (00:29:34):
Wow, I appreciate that.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:59):
Yeah, you're really putting your mind and heart into it all.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Enough about me, I'm thinking about, but I appreciate it, I'm thinking about product managers and founders maybe listening to this and they're like, oh man, every time I do a deck, I need to create this whole story and this up and down thing. In your experience, when do you go that far to create? Is this when you have an epic important presentation, you think about a story structure like this, or is there always a way you should put this into your presentations of some kind of story with this contrast?

Nancy Duarte (00:30:31):
It's interesting question. I think a lot of people think that the only time you really need to present well is when you have a big stage talk and you make the big investment in the script, the big investment in the contrasting story. But I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss, kind of just that first bit, what is, what could be new bliss. It's like even the very, very short talk that Abraham Lincoln gave in the Gettysburg address, it was basically a funeral, it was a eulogy. And back then eulogies used to be two hours long. It was an Aristotelian structure and he only had a couple hundred words, so there's no pictures of him giving it because it was so short, so tight and done.

(00:31:16):
They were setting up the cameras, still thinking they had tons of time. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, getting the husband to do some chores for me, literally it works. It works in any format. And I think the investment that you make in the longer form or when it's a huge audience, you add the visuals, you really hire the speaker coaches, you really make that moment. And there's these moments that breach above all other moments where you really have to nail it just in basic conversations, in a moment of influence. If you practice it enough, it'll live in your head as a mental model for when you're in a situation where there's influence in the air that you could do.

Lenny (00:32:07):
How do you actually do it with your husband if you could share for helping you do the dishes?

Nancy Duarte (00:32:11):
Well, I won't get graphic about what the new bliss might be, but early in our marriage we figured out that, not early, I actually spent almost in the only the last 10 years we've been married for 40. And we realized that when we tangle it's usually only about process. So, the gaps are if I ask or he asks me to do something or we start to kind of pick on each other, it's because the way I'm executing something is different than the way he chose to execute it. And so it'll be anything from like, "Why are you chopping onions like that?" He'll say to me. And now I'm like, oh, we have a process gap. "Do you want to chop the onions or do you want me to chop them my way?" So, for the what is, what could be new bliss, it happens all the time.

(00:32:59):
So, he needs a lot of context. He's a detail-oriented person and I've started to learn with him that my what is needs to be quite a bit longer than sometimes I have patience for as I start to frame, "Oh hey baby, I need you to take the dog over to the dog care." I don't start there. I start with, "Oh my gosh, tomorrow I've got back to back meetings, in fact, I'm going to be on Lenny's Podcast right about here. And that's when she's whiny. And what's going to happen is if that doesn't happen, I'm going to have to reschedule next week and next week it's just loaded up. And you know how it is when I'm stressed out at the end of the day and I'm kind of hard to deal with and I say, well, what could be, the doggy place, she was loved it last time she was spooning with a red cavalier king spaniel and loved it."

(00:33:46):
It's like that, I have to unpack it a little bit more for him. And then the new bliss could be any sort of marital promise you want it to be, but I just have to unpack the current state a little bit of the process, and then I state what could be. And it's funny because acts of service like that, like him taking the dog to the doggy daycare for me or is I feel loved. So, when someone does something generous with their time for me, it's how I feel loved. And so there's a whole lot there in shaping how you communicate with someone. Empathetically at my company, everyone knows each other's love language. They know that this person feels more appreciated when they get a written note. This person feels more appreciated when they get a gift and everyone knows that. So, that's just baked into our, I don't know, our marriage, our company, just how it rolls.

Lenny (00:34:43):
I imagine people listening to this podcast were not expecting marriage advice. And so I love that. I'm going to try.

Nancy Duarte (00:34:50):
You can scrap that if it doesn't work the process tip though is good.

Lenny (00:34:52):
This is going to be the best part. This is going to be the whole podcast is just the segment. Just joking. But this is really good advice. I'm going to try to use it myself. So, the structure, I think it's even easier to think about this less as story, infused story. For me it's more this, what is, what could be, what is the ideal bliss, that's almost the simpler way to think about it. The story is this like, oh my God, I got to think of a story.

Nancy Duarte (00:35:17):
It has a beginning, middle, and an end. So, the first, what is is the beginning. The middle is the messy middle. That's where you're trying to contrast and show them that it's messy. It might be hard, it's worth it. And then the new bliss, you end with what in western cultures, where's like a happy ending. So, the new bliss is just imagine a world with your idea adopted, and then you paint a picture of that world poetically or pragmatically, and it works. It definitely works.

Lenny (00:35:41):
Okay, this is really great. So, just to recap, point one is to make your listener the hero of the story and come at it with empathy. And I was actually thinking the Think Different campaign is an excellent example of that because it's about you thinking differently and being this incredible creative. And then item two is infuse your presentation with story and this what is, what could be new bliss. And then, okay, and number three, what was number three again?

Nancy Duarte (00:36:09):
Oh, it was ask yourself if they can see what you're saying. Can they see what I'm saying would be written on the note?

Lenny (00:36:16):
I love this. Okay, let's talk about that. What does that mean and how do you do that?

Nancy Duarte (00:36:20):
Yeah, so for people to see what you're saying, that you have an opportunity to use visual tools like the presentation software, you have opportunities to have live sketchers sketch it while you're talking. There's so many ways you can help people see what you're saying. I would contend that you can use something in your talk that gives people something they'll always remember. We call that a star moment. And it could be a piece of dramatic data where the big numbers put up there. It could be an evocative story, it could be a beautiful picture. And one of the things that happens really well, especially with tech companies, is demonstrating through a picture so you can get alignment. So, the concept of a diagram when you describe your product that you're working on, is this thing inside of it, outside of it attached to it, is it on it is above it, especially architecture slides or just how technology works as something flows through a complex system.

(00:37:20):
When people can see that and it accompanies your verbal narrative, they can actually understand what you're conveying and move on. If you only had a verbal narrative, it wouldn't work as well. There's a lot of times though, where you don't have the support of a presentation or slides. You could be at a dinner table. If you're in a interesting conversation and you want someone to see what you're saying, that's where you pull out the napkin and you draw it. So, you could both see it, in meetings sometimes someone will just walk right up to the board and draw something. And my team, especially my design team is so good at this because they'll just stand up and say, I want to draw for you what I see, because we're about to prepare them to present to an audience. When you verbally said that, I saw this, was that your intent?

(00:38:03):
And then the room will stand up and we'll start all co-creating a graphic so that everyone sees the exact same thing, the exact same steps, the exact same insights in the order. So, nobody leaves with a question in their mind. And that's just so important for there to be an alignment around what is this? What are we all fighting for? What are we all living for? What are we all working for? And those moments of alignment are so, so important. And I'm a leader who sees things in the air. I just see it. And to me, my pattern finding nature, which you're like that too. I could see these patterns and to me, I see a whole scene and I could see it all clearly, but when my team's trying to look at the same thing, they might see 22 mosaic tiles out of a massive mosaic beautiful picture.

(00:38:53):
I see the final beautiful picture, but I've only served up a little tiny mosaic tile in a few places. And so I even have to be better about really bringing it to earth and saying, oh, here's the seven steps to get to this amazing outcome. Sometimes we see things so plainly in our mind's eye, and I was working with a really famous, powerful CEO and as she was talking, it's like, yeah, I could see her. I was watching her hand motions too, and she was like in this thing and she's moving her arms around in a distinct way and I said, I can tell you you have a picture in your mind's eye.

(00:39:31):
Let me draw for what I, and I did the same thing, walked up, drew had this, had this, had this. And she's like, "Exactly." And we were brought in because nobody could articulate at all what she saw in her mind's eye. And so that was a massive program to be rolled out to the entire retail. It was like a hundred thousand retail workers needed to understand this graphic and the whole process she was trying to roll out wasn't getting traction. So, the minute people could see what she was saying, then it had all the breakthroughs that needed to happen around that program.

Lenny (00:40:04):
That reminds me of when I was working on the super host program at Airbnb. I don't know if the story will be of any interest to anyone, but I just remember I had this very clear handset of motions that described the strategy of the super host program. And then my friend's like, you should draw this on a slide-

Nancy Duarte (00:40:19):
You should draw it. Unless it's such a powerful hand gesture, right? Yeah, you could do that because your body is visual. And the other thing we try to get our customers to do is, if Dr. King had slides that day of the I Have a Dream speech, it just wouldn't been as beautiful. His words painted the pictures in our mind's eye. And so when we can have the slides off so people are focused on the verbal stream and what's coming out of your mouth that is such a powerful moment is to not have any visuals supporting you. So, they're a hundred percent focused on your body, how you're showing up and on the words coming out of your mouth and they're verbally seeing what you're saying versus actually pictorially seeing what you're saying. It's good.

Lenny (00:41:03):
I like the idea that people are not staring at me and I prefer them distracted with a slide and I want to talk about nerves and stuff presenting in a bit. But that's interesting. So, you were talking about very kind of some concrete tips for slides and something I've heard a lot is when you're sharing a deck internally or talking an internal meeting, it's really powerful to just have obviously just a quick image thing, but then also the title of the slide is the point you want them to get from that slide. Is that something you recommend? And then generally any just very tactical advice on how to make a slide effective?

Nancy Duarte (00:41:35):
Yeah, the concept that each slide should make one point. So, your whole presentation should be grounded in what we call the audience journey, which is the big idea where you're trying to move them from where you're trying to move them to. Then a big idea is what is your point of view and what's at stake if they do or do not adopt it? That's the organizing mechanism for your whole deck. And then each slide itself that supports that one big, big idea, each slide itself should make one point in support of that big idea. People can't process too many things at one time, so depending on where you work, some people want something that's not the key insight at the top of the slide, some people do. So, some might want the action to be taken or some might want the dreamy future state to be clear.

(00:42:22):
Some consulting firms where the slides are much denser because they were paid millions of dollars to make a big old deck. Some of them are like, "Oh, it always belongs in the lower right corner." So, it's kind of a little bit up to the brand and everyone believes it belongs somewhere else. If you're making what we call a slide doc, which I think your listenership would be interested in, presentations go from big staged event to in a meeting where you're trying to persuade your peers too. Can I make a presentation I can just circulate on email and everyone gets it? Well, that's called a slide doc. You put more words, you put stronger picture. You could have a hundred page appendix and maybe the front of it's only five slides, but everything they need to see your thinking, it follows behind it.

(00:43:08):
And you could circulate those and people read it. You write full sentences, you write full pros. It's kind of like the six page memo that's so popular to Amazon, but we contend that the F words and pictures, the six page memo is better. So, how do you send a memo around without the help of a presenter? And that's on one extreme. And those are called slide docs that you build in presentation software. And then the other extreme is I'm on a massive stage somewhere and there's all kinds of usage in between. And so I think the one idea per slide is important. And then this guiding principle, don't make a single slide unless it supports the one big idea of your whole talk. That's another principle for slide making, because most people go back to some sort of repository in some data store somewhere and they dig through old crappy slides and see if they can assemble something super quickly.

(00:44:01):
And that's a cop out. Most of the time if you really think empathetically about your audience, going to the repository might get you halfway there, but you should be modifying and mapping all of the content based on who you're talking to and especially if it's high stakes. And sometimes you're speaking to an audience that wants high density slides, because that's how they communicate in their culture. And if you showed up with cinematic stage ready slides, they'd laugh you out of the room. And so you really got to, I mean, you got to know your audience, you got to know how they communicate, who they talk to and map to that.

Lenny (00:44:39):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.

(00:45:16):
Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basically through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports, test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning plans. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity. What's your take on the Minto Pyramid principle? I don't know if you think about that. Yeah, because there's a recommendation of just start with the conclusion and then explain why. And you're saying sometimes that's effective, sometimes not. Maybe in [inaudible 00:46:00]-

Nancy Duarte (00:45:59):
Sometimes it's effective. So, the Minto principle is amazing. She's got the, was it horizontal and vertical thinking? So, your main segues or your main section head should add up and then all the slides should support it. And then also how the construct of it is and when you state the conclusion first, that's a great thing to do with execs. It's a great thing to do when you are fundraising. There's a certain type of an audience that works for, and there's other audiences where they really need to be taught to long for this future state and you need longer to unpack it. So, one of the reasons you would start with the conclusion is especially in a funding round, now my version of a conclusion or result or is different than how she describes it. Because I would say you start with the new bliss. So, if you're trying to raise funds, you would say, I am going to share with you something today and you share how your solution increases human flourishing.

(00:47:02):
It needs to be tied to the humanness and the big problem you're going to solve and how humankind will benefit. Well, that's different than just a consultant would show up and say, hi, I have this 800 page deck and the results of it are this. Let's unpack it. It's just a completely different motion and we use a three act story structure that's quite a bit different too. But that work is solid and it was based kind of like my work, her work was based in going super deep in McKinsey's thinking over time, whereas my work is going laterally across the 35 highest performing brands in the world that have been our customers. So, I went laterally across all those brands and then come up with solutions that are based, foreign story and are based in a bit of a broader application across companies that I have tons of respect for that body of work.

Lenny (00:47:57):
Awesome. And willing to, I wrote a post about this whole concept for folks that want to dig deeper. Maybe one more question around tactical slide stuff, and I know this is, people ask you about this stuff all the time, but I can't help it. I guess just any other tips for just like you're sitting there trying to create a couple slides. What else maybe people should keep in mind to make it effective and let's say this is for a small meeting kind of thing.

Nancy Duarte (00:48:18):
Yeah, that's a good question. I think that if do some thinking first, if it's important, if it's an important point of the meeting, my team is taught to just kind of sketch, change your environment up a little bit. A lot of people will fire up the deck, which is very linear. It's like make one slide, second slide, third slide. So, just think and plan for a minute. And we tend to draw up storyboards. It's like, okay, the first point, the second point, the third point or the just think first. It can be analog or digital. Put a page in front of all your decks. It's just boxes. Just get the narrative right. And then when you actually open up the software, that's where you have to think about, what's the slide type that will convey this the most? Is it a table? Put a table. Especially for program managers, you have to convey dense project information, program information, product information, and that comes with density.

(00:49:12):
So, if you're in a room with your peers and everyone in the room is a team and everyone has their own shorthanded and way of working, put that common slide up there. That common slide for that team might be dense to the outside world, but everyone's used to using it so there's no harm in using a commonly known, commonly acceptable framework or slide or table or Excel spreadsheet because you're aligning around a process. And so don't feel like every needs like cinematic pictures of kittens because that's not going to get you anywhere. You're trying to move an objective along, and that does mean that your slides might be more dense and sometimes internal slides have a lot more important information that needs to be on it to kick a product along or kick a process along.

Lenny (00:50:00):
You were just talking about process and that is a great segue to a question I wanted to ask is just what does your process look like when you're working with a company to help them craft an awesome presentation?

Nancy Duarte (00:50:10):
Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because I don't have to do this much anymore. I haven't done it for about 15 years, which is nice. I have a gorgeous team of strategist, writers, conceptual thinkers, beautiful design.

Lenny (00:50:22):
I was curious.

Nancy Duarte (00:50:24):
Coaches. Yeah, I know. I get coached. It's fun. I definitely, my books look awesome, not because of me, but because I'm followed around by people that do really gorgeous work. But the phrase that we use internally and sometimes with customers is we make presentations the way Pixar makes movies. And that's very similar to the way we get somebody that has this high stakes moment where it's a big deal in this moment. You have to win in the moment to push things along. And so we do, we literally craft a narrative, craft the big idea, craft the script and visualize certain moments. We start to map it out, we start to chunk it out.

(00:51:05):
And then big models sometimes when you're really making a revolutionary model, one that could drive all the web assets, a lot of that stuff people don't realize actually happens in the presentation first as an idea. So, sometimes we'll start working on some of the key models right away too, and we start to circulate that around the company, because everyone has to build consensus around it. So, sometimes there's multiple motions happening at the same time. Let's sketch this. You go away, you work with this department, you try to get this settled, you get that set, you get this.

(00:51:36):
And then it gets reassembled at the end. And then the narrative is where you work all the kinks out and then when they stand and deliver, it's like, yes, it's the voice track that all the process supported. And then other times we're building a report in a slide doc, or there was a time where we had a head of a multinational company that will remain nameless and the guy that was head of all of India was going to come over here and petition the CEO for a hundred million dollar budget.

(00:52:09):
It's not trivial. And he comes, is like, "Okay, I need your help with these five slides." And he just sends us the five slides and we're like, "Well yeah, a hundred million. That's kind of a lot. You really want to put technology between you and the CEO. Do you really want to sit side by side and both be looking at a computer in this moment where it's like you're petitioning him for, that's a lot of money." And he's like, "Yeah, you're right." So, what we did is we made a mental model he could hold up in his head and the structure was so simple and clear. And then there was three moments where we're like just, I don't know, just grab a piece of paper or go to a whiteboard and just start to draw in front of him. Let him see your eyes, let him have eye contact.

(00:52:46):
Let him see your passion. Don't be dispassionately looking at this computer. And he did it and he called us and he's like, "I got a hundred million bucks." So, it's just those moments where you have to realize, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do I need a deck? Who am I talking to? And should is this a cookie cutter thing? And does the same process work every time? No. So, every time we solve something it's very different and we try to make it unique to the presenter and the audience that they're speaking to.

Lenny (00:53:18):
Along the same lines, a lot of presentations now are actually remote and on Zoom and virtual. What do you recommend to people in terms of how they present and put presentations together being remote?

Nancy Duarte (00:53:28):
Yeah, it's funny, we spent a lot of time coaching people to look in the camera. So, while I've been talking to you, I'm not actually looking at your face. I'm looking at the little dot at the top of my screen and my camera. And not a lot of people can do that. So, it's gotten to where I can see that little white glowing dot and my heart warms, I know you're there, I feel you. I can get sensations in my skin when I know I'm talking to someone that I adore or admire. And that took a long time to get there. And I was presenting remotely pre COVID. So, a lot of our coaching was about eye contact and doing that. The other thing that happens is people don't see our hands anymore. They're under the table. They can't see how much space in a room we're taking up.

(00:54:15):
They can't see a lot of the characteristics that are common in communicating. And so there's a lot of coaching around presence and how do you have presence in a room? How do you even get the microphone away from someone that's remote and all those kinds of things. And a new study just came out, I just came across my desk today and it said that soft skills really suffered. And the people who did it right say and looked at the camera, they don't have good eye contact skills anymore. When they are looking face-to-face in someone's eyes, it's like, oh, they're not used to it. It's been so long.

(00:54:50):
And then the other thing is, where do I sit in a room who's got the position of authority? Just kind of some classic things that convey information in real life. So, it's interesting, it peaked and now people are going back to the office some. A percent are back in the office. And now we have this weird place where it's, oh, it's half in the office and half people are remote. And the people that are remote are having a hard time getting their voices heard because the people in the room consume most of the air. So, it's kind of going through this undulating life cycle of new communication skills people need while they're remote. It's all changing.

Lenny (00:55:34):
I'm glad that I was not a PM in this remote world to be honest. I never experienced it, but I have a lot of empathy for being a product manager in this remote work world. Feels like the job got a lot harder.

Nancy Duarte (00:55:44):
It did. I think it did.

Lenny (00:55:46):
Yeah. So, let's talk about nerves and stage fright. So, I hate public speaking. I get extremely nervous people. They may not feel this when they watch me, but it's not my natural state. You work with a lot of people that I imagine are like, oh my god, I'm so scared to give this presentation. What advice do you give them to help them through that and feel more comfortable?

Nancy Duarte (00:56:06):
Yeah, I think people who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking have better content. They tend to really think through stuff than someone who's like, I got this. I'll just wing it. I'll just walk on the stage. Anyone who's like, tells me I am a nervous presenter, I'm like, you have probably got gorgeous content in your heart that the world needs to hear, because usually they are really deep and thoughtful. Like you already mentioned, you're a pattern finder and you like to do thoughtful work. And so it's hard. My husband is actually a brilliant communicator, just getting him to feel like he wants to take up the space. He's a better communicator than I am. And so what happens is the reason you get scared, it's a fight or flight instinct. For some reason stepping out on that stage, you feel your body and your mind and your psyche is feeling threatened like you would be attacked by an animal.

(00:56:56):
That's literally what's happening. And so you couple things you could do. You can actually sit in one of the seats of the auditorium and just sit there and look at the stage, look at the setting so you can imagine yourself on it. But then picture yourself as that friendly face, the one that's happy to see you, the one that's delighted that you're speaking. And then as you're standing up, remember that you saw yourself sitting there smiling and very happy. You have to change your visual model that people's faces will be scowling, they'll be judging you, they'll be doubting you. All of those things are only in your head because getting you out on the stage to be able to start to expose people to this amazing content you have, the biggest battle is to get you out on this stage and delivering it.

(00:57:47):
And I asked a bunch of people once, I did a survey of all these public speakers and was like, how do you prepare? How do you prepare? What's your pre-talk ritual? And some of them were like, "I play heavy metal music and I skip around the entire convention center, just get all fired up." I'm like, "Wow, I have to calm myself down because I already have over to the top energy." So, I literally find the dark. I don't go to the green room, that stuff. I don't like to hear gibber jabber. I have to be focused on my content. And so I find the darkest corner of the backstage and calmly sit and just breathe. I just breathe. Sometimes if I'm nervous, if there's someone real famous in the audience, I have a little list playlist of funny things that people sent me, but I never watch. And that way right before I walk on stage, I chemically, my whole body chemically shifts from nervous to laughter. And that really helps me too, because it's chemical and you have to train your chemistry a bit.

Lenny (00:58:46):
I really like that tip. What are these funny things you watch if you-

Nancy Duarte (00:58:50):
It's like YouTube things, TikTok things. Just things that I tag and I try not to watch them or things that make me laugh. There's this dorky low watched video of a guy with tin cans wrapped around his waist and he plays them. And my husband walks around the house like him and making the noise and I could probably sing the beat if I had to. And so sometimes I just play that, because it just transports me home, because a lot of times I'm presenting away from home and it just makes me laugh at my husband who's hysterical. So, it's just random things, but if you laugh and somehow can transport yourself outside of the fear of walking out there, it helps reset you before you walk out on stage.

Lenny (00:59:39):
I really like that. Is there anything else just off the top of your head that just like right before you go on stage that you find to be really effective? So, watching funny videos, I love that. [inaudible 00:59:47] use it. Anything else?

Nancy Duarte (00:59:48):
I breathe. I think I've learned a breathing pattern. I take a deep, deep breath and then I take that one while my lungs are full, I take another gulp of breath and I have to let it out real slow. But when I got the feedback that my friend and some people get over their fear by headbanging to heavy metal, so I'm not saying that's not the wrong thing. So, I thought, well, maybe I should try that before I do a talk. And so I literally didn't do that. But I stretched, I jumped a little, just low jumps, put my arms real big up in the air. And then I walked on stage and I happened to be speaking at a massive medical company, like big brand. And I finished my talk and my assistant got a call and they were like, "We're little worried about Nancy. We think she might need to see a doctor. She could never control her breathing and we're really concerned."

(01:00:38):
And it was just because I just pumped myself up a little bit. So, I don't do that whatsoever anymore. I went back to my calming, contemplative, meditative pre-talk ritual. So, for some people, literally I do encourage people to try headbanging to heavy metal. It might work. It's just a matter of what you need. And nobody would guess that I'm not one to dance around or pump myself up, but I am not, I have to calm myself down. It's the opposite.

Lenny (01:01:09):
Awesome. Just a few more questions.

Nancy Duarte (01:01:12):
Sure.

Lenny (01:01:12):
So, you wrote a book called Illuminate and something that stood out to me from that book is this idea of a torch bearer and torch bearer leader. Can you just talk about what that is and why that is important in power?

Nancy Duarte (01:01:22):
Yeah, I loved writing that book. Co-author Patty Sanchez, a hat tip to her. So, to come up with this book, we knew that there's one presentation, there's a single presentation, could be on a stage, could be in a meeting, just updating people on a project status. And we knew though that every presentation usually is part of a larger movement where you're trying to move people in mass to this alternate future. So, we studied movements, we deconstructed the largest movements. We met with Marshall Ganz at Harvard to say, "Hey, could this be true?" Because he studies movements. It was so fun. And then movements have a five act structure. So, picture, there's this moment where you have to verbalize the dream like, hey, we're going to head to this new place and this is what I have to do at my kickoff meetings. It's like imagine this place in the future that we're headed to.

(01:02:15):
So, it's five steps, it's a five act story structure, if you want to call it five acts. It's dream, leap, fight, climb, arrive. So, the torch bearer, the reason we called that is the leaders know where they're headed, but they might not ever see it super, super clearly. And we chose a torch because a torch, if you're in a cave and you have a torch, you only see about five, eight feet around you, but it's enough to dissipate the fear of the people following you in. And so nobody sees the future clearly. Nobody has that kind of level skill. All we know is I need to traverse this direction to be at the right place in the future so all my staff is safe, all are, we stay a leader in the industry. That's all I know. And as we start to head there, there's these moments of communication you need to do, which is, hey everyone, here's the dream. Here's where we're headed. That's the dream phase.

(01:03:09):
Then there's this moment where they either choose to jump in and go with you or they choose not to. You could talk about Frodo like Sam and only a few hobbits followed him. And so it's like people select to commit this journey. That's the beginning of your movement. But then the middle is the messy middle of a story. We call it the fight and climb phase. So, what happens is they commit to your idea, they commit to your program, your project, and they're like enthused at first. And then they go into the state of, oh my God, this is harder than I thought. It's a long slog. This climb is getting exhausted. I don't know if I have this much fight in me to make this all work, not fight with each other, but like, oh my God, I'm having to overcome this roadblock and that roadblock and we have to go get that budget.

(01:03:53):
So, it's just, it's like a fight, climb, fight, climb, fight, climb. And then ultimately you arrive. Each one of those five phases you need to use speeches, stories, ceremonies and symbols at each phase to give the people traveling with you the emotional fuel they need to keep going, to keep seeing that idea become realized. And it literally is about fueling the right emotions with speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols while you're moving people toward a bigger initiative. So, it's bigger than just one presentation, it's multiple presentations, multiple stories, multiple ceremonies. So, I loved that book. People are really feeding off of it right now because leading change has been nonstop. It's just been change, change, change the last especially few years.

Lenny (01:04:40):
Change is the only constant like they say.

Nancy Duarte (01:04:42):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:04:43):
I really like this metaphor of the torch giving you a sense of, as a leader, you can see some portion around you, but you're not going to see the entire cave necessarily. That is really interesting. Maybe a final question very tactically is I give an interview where you shared that you had kind of two videos, one where it's very informal, you're just standing in front of whiteboard in jeans or something, just talking about some about data, I think in presentations. And then you had a similar video where it was very well constructed, high production value, and the informal video did a lot better. Is that something you're seeing? Just that kind of content ends up being more successful and why do you think that is?

Nancy Duarte (01:05:21):
I think video content, production quality now isn't the expectation for it being high quality. It's just completely shifted over the last five, eight years or so as everyone's an expert and can show up as an expert. There's a big difference to me about showing up as a keynoter, which is like, I'm going to stand, I'm going to look right. I'm going to have this eye contact, I'm going to nail it. My slides are gorgeous, I'm driving the industry. And for people to think that our explanations of things needs to be done as a stand and deliver keynote, that's just not true. So, I experimented with that and I had some videos I had done, and one of them, like you said, was me looking in the camera. I even had HD makeup, a film crew. I was well lit, I looked amazing. I mean, I did look amazing and it was polished.

(01:06:09):
I delivered it really well. And then I thought, because on LinkedIn I post a lot, that's where my primary channel is, and I thought what would happen if I just posted a rando shot of me? And I'm maybe airing on a little bit like orange, I look a little Trumpian, a little bit orange. It's not color corrected, but it's super informative, really full of information. And that was my highest viewed video so far. And I realized that it's like people want the content and we do as a presentation company, I have to nail it maybe more than others, but it doesn't have to be fully video edited, infographics spinning, swooshing things forward and swooshing things back.

(01:06:50):
That kind of nature of it is not necessary to get the message across. And so we actually have a whole process and program we're rolling out where you're going to see a lot more video from us, partially from that insight, but partially because my team, I have a team of experts, they have a lot of great things to share, and so I'm trying to give them, I'm trying to make it be like Duarte does not equal Nancy Duarte. I'm trying to make it so it's like so many experts work at Duarte, you got to watch any video from any of them is where we're moving at Duarte. They're freaks of brilliance and just experts. They're world class experts. So, that's what we're trying to do.

Lenny (01:07:27):
I feel like you have a similar challenge to me where I named my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter.

Nancy Duarte (01:07:32):
Yeah, same thing.

Lenny (01:07:33):
[inaudible 01:07:33] talk about that.

Nancy Duarte (01:07:33):
Same thing.

Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah, can never be anyone else. It's a challenge, but yeah, don't know, it worked out. Okay. Actually, real final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Have you seen examples of product managers specifically telling really good stories?

Nancy Duarte (01:07:46):
The product management process has multiple phase. There's the creative explorative process all the way through to getting it produced. And I think story can take you along in each phase. So, there's example, which I read about, I wasn't actually even part of, but Brian Chesky at Airbnb, there was a whole article where he unpacked this moment in their product development cycle where they decided they would take a walk in the shoes of their customer and they hired a Pixar illustrator to illustrate each scene as the team's like, okay, okay, they said this is her name. And they were like, okay, what happens? Her alarm goes off. Okay, what happens next? What happens next? Okay, now she's decided she needs to book something. What does she do? She wants to do that. They realized from this little walk in the shoes of their customer just this day in the life, which is a classic storytelling method for any product, they realized that they had their strategy wrong, that they needed to move as soon as possible to a mobile first strategy.

(01:08:46):
And it was just because they actually thought about, okay. She goes, brushes their teeth, they do this. They were just literally walking through the life of their ideal customer and that was when they realized they had it all messed up. But the other phases, after all this work people put into product and the making of the product and the managing of pushing it through. We have a large client that makes shoes or athletic things. I love telling stories, but I can't say this. And there's this moment where we get brought in and could you please train our product people in story? We're like, "What's the big problem?" They're like, "They'll spend a year or two on a shoe and be like, chunk, put it on the table. And they're like, what do you have to say about it?" They're like, "It's red." And it's like all these years of investment, all these years, they couldn't unpack any sort of story or any sort of reason or even their passion for why they chose red.

(01:09:41):
And it was like, here's my shoe, it's red. And so this ability to move things along by adding meaning or why and then wrapping it in a story actually can get a product chosen or rejected or there's just so many examples of different spaces in the product cycle that could benefit from a really well told story from, like I said, how the products innovate in the roadmap all the way through to what gets accepted. And then the big reveal, you think about even all the big Apple launches, it's about a big product reveal. It's about revealing this thing that had been hidden for so long and it's another moment to tell amazing stories. So, that's kind of a little bit of an insight on the product side of how to use story.

Lenny (01:10:27):
The Airbnb example is an awesome example. It's all true. When I joined Airbnb is actually right there in the process of doing that.

Nancy Duarte (01:10:34):
I love that.

Lenny (01:10:36):
And they ended up drawing these key frames of the journey as you described, and they put it right in the center of the office. Here's the journey of a host and a guest that's like 12 frames of that journey. And that actually became the strategy of the company is let's pick six of these frames and make them awesome. And that's what we're going to do.

Nancy Duarte (01:10:36):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:10:54):
Make booking experience awesome. Make the arrival experience awesome. So, there's a lot of truth to that.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:00):
And it was visualized, right? The vision was visualized like what you're saying we're headed in the future. And it was super clear. I love that story. So cool you were there.

Lenny (01:11:09):
Yeah, it was very cool. And they actually were very mobile. You could grab one of these drawings and bring it to your desk and how are we going to make this moment better this week?

Nancy Duarte (01:11:17):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:11:19):
And it was actually indeed, Pixar storyboard artist that they hired for a year. That was his job. Draw these key frames.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:25):
Oh, that's amazing.

Lenny (01:11:27):
And it connects so directly with your point about empathy. That was the epitome of empathy. Here's what the guest and hosts are going through, and here's where we can do better.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:37):
Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah, it does tie together.

Lenny (01:11:40):
If folks want to look this up, by the way, we'll link in the show notes. If you just Google Snow White Airbnb, you can watch a video of how they all kind of came about this. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:54):
Yep, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:11:56):
What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:00):
I think I always classically recommend the gospels because there's just so much love and groundbreaking thinking there. And then for people who do wind up taking an interest in story, I think one of the best books, if you want to pick that up, is Chris Vogler's, The Writer's Journey, where he took Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, made it 12 Steps, and he was a Disney story analyst. So, it's just really classic body of work that had really helped people get their minds around story and the archetypes.

Lenny (01:12:30):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:33):
It's my little sinful pleasure. It's way into K drama, Korean drama. Don't even ask me how, but I'm way into that. I've seen almost all of them now. I'm at the bottom of the barrel of them.

Lenny (01:12:44):
Is there a favorite?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:45):
No, my husband just watched one. It's called Business Proposal, and he watched it with me and he's like, oh no, now I'm going to be hooked too. They're just real. They're just cute as a button. And they have a longer arc. They're like an epic length tail. They drop in 12 part seasons or one season 12. Anyway, don't even get me started. It sounds dumb, because I like the epic tales and the dramas, but they're cute.

Lenny (01:12:45):
I love it.

Nancy Duarte (01:13:07):
They're just cute.

Lenny (01:13:08):
This is great. Getting very real. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're hiring?

Nancy Duarte (01:13:14):
Oh, favorite interview question. We ask a lot about who they are. So, we use psychometrics a lot here, and we really understand who they are, and we actually ask people to tell a story. And if that's uncomfortable or those psychometrics are uncomfortable, they're not really a fit, because we are a systemic story culture, and we define empathy at the company as know yourself, accept yourself, kind of work on yourself, and then adapt to others. So, if people aren't open to really understanding how they show up then and then adapt and change under our care, then we don't hire them.

Lenny (01:13:51):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Nancy Duarte (01:13:55):
I'm excited about a tool I just paid for last week. It's called writer.com. So, it's built on multiple language models and including, it's going to be trained on our own, all my IP, all my books, every blog post, it'll learn the voice and it'll use my own kind of language model to help us write faster. So, we put really good prompts in and we get a really good product out. So, I'm super excited about that.

Lenny (01:14:17):
I'm actually an investor in that company, so this is great to hear.

Nancy Duarte (01:14:20):
Oh yeah. That's awesome.

Lenny (01:14:21):
Writer.com. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your approach to developing presentations that has had a big impact on your ability to execute and get them out?

Nancy Duarte (01:14:33):
Yeah. I think there's the biggest roadblock for so long that made things painful was the edit cycles. How do we do a round with a client? Then you have multiple version, then you have version control. So, we've come up with this annotation system, so everyone on a project knows exactly the status of that slide, and there's no way really to check slides in and out. And so we've come up with this amazing, beautiful, very visual process where everyone knows the exact status of the slide, and it's really easy. You could put it in thumbnail mode and be like, hmm, we're 80% complete. Everyone's going to focus on just these two things. So, that part of the process, especially enterprise at scale where 20 or 30 people are contributors to a deck. That process we made is the clients are really liking it.

Lenny (01:15:14):
To leave people with one final tip to give better presentations. What would that be?

Nancy Duarte (01:15:18):
To become a better presenter, pick a topic you are passionate about, something where you're like, oh my gosh, I've got to see this happen. And pick that topic and be so passionate about it. Work on that talk or stand up at a volunteer thing and really work on something that makes you feel passionate. And then in the future when you're presenting something that you're not passionate about, everything you learned will apply to a business presentation, but you're going to have that feeling. You're going to know what it's like to present from your soul and from a place of passion and the great presenters tap into that passion point and pull from that, and that's what makes them a great presenter on other topics, that they might not be as passionate about.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Nancy, I so appreciate you making time for this. It's been an honor.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:01):
You're amazing.

Lenny (01:16:02):
Everything. You're amazing.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:03):
You're amazing.

Lenny (01:16:05):
You're amazing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they'd like to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nancy Duarte (01:16:12):
Oh, they can find me at duarte.com. There's also a duarte.com/nancy where I've got a ton of free stuff where you could find a lot of the things I've talked about. I'm on Twitter @NancyDuarte, and I do connect to everyone who connects to me on LinkedIn, which is kind of fun. So, I think, how could they be useful to me? I think it will cure so many problems if everyone became a really good communicator, so you can help me by working hard on your communication skills, working hard on your clarity, and making everyone around you much happier people.

Lenny (01:16:47):
What a beautiful way to end it. Nancy, again, thank you so much for being here.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:50):
Oh, you're amazing. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:16:52):
We're amazing. Let's end it.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:52):
We are. Let's just say it.

# Inside ChatGPT: The fastest growing product in history  | Nick Turley (OpenAI)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart. Now, you're the PM of the most consequential product in history.

Nick Turley (00:00:05):
I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab. My first task was I fix the blinds, or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
When someone offers you a rocket ship, don't ask which seat.

Nick Turley (00:00:13):
We set out to build a super assistant. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What was it called before?

Nick Turley (00:00:17):
It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be a successful product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
And then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it."

Nick Turley (00:00:23):
This is a pattern with AI, you won't know what to polish until after you ship. My dream is that we ship daily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
By the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5.

Nick Turley (00:00:31):
About 10% of the world population uses every week. With scale comes responsibility. It just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human. This model has taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):
Kevin Weil, your CPO, said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?"

Nick Turley (00:00:43):
I just really want to jump to the punchline, "Why can't we do this now?" I always felt like part of my role here is to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Everyone is always wondering, "Is Chat the future of all of this stuff?"

Nick Turley (00:00:52):
Chat was the simplest way to ship at that time. I'm baffled by how much it took off, even more baffled by how many people have copied.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter.

Nick Turley (00:01:02):
That is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive. I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):
Can you give us a peek into where this goes long-term?

Nick Turley (00:01:09):
ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS. We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today, my guest is Nick Turley. Nick is Head of ChatGPT at OpenAI. He joined the company three years ago, when it was still primarily a research lab. He helped come up with the idea of ChatGPT and took it from 0 to over 700 million weekly active users, billions in revenue, and arguably the most successful and impactful consumer software product in human history. Nick is incredible. He's been very much under the radar. This is the first major podcast interview that he has ever done, and you are in for a treat. We talk about all the things, including the just launched GPT-5.

(00:01:50):

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:31):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:34):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:41):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names, like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain, start and scale their security programs, and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:20):
That is very much our experience, but before the company, and some extent, during it, but the idea is, with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:36):
We appreciate you for doing that, and you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's vanta.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:50):
Thank you!

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Nick, thank you so much for joining me, and welcome to the podcast.

Nick Turley (00:04:59):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):
I already had a billion questions I wanted to ask you, and then you guys decided to launch GPT-5 the week that we're recording this. So, now, I have at least 2 billion questions for you. I hope you have a lot of time. First of all, just congrats on the launch. It's coming tomorrow, the day after recording this. Just congrats. How are you feeling? I imagine this is an ungodly amount of work and stress. How are you doing?

Nick Turley (00:05:22):
It's a busy week, but we've been working on this for a while, so it also feels really good to get it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):
So, by the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5, the newest ChatGPT. What's the simplest way to just understand what this is, what it unlocks, what people can do with it? Give us the pitch.

Nick Turley (00:05:39):
I'm so excited about GPT-5. I think for most people, it's going to feel like a real step change. If you're the average ChatGPT user, and we have 700 million of them this week, you've probably been on GPT-4o for a while. You probably don't even think about the model that powers the product. And GPT-5, it just feels categorically different. I'll talk about a lot of the specifics, but at the end of the day, the vibes are good, at least we feel that way. We hope that users feel the same. And increasingly, that is the thing that I think most people notice, right? They don't look at the academic benchmarks. They don't look at evaluations. They try the model and see what it feels like. And just on that dimension alone, I'm so excited. I've been using it for a while, but it is also the smartest, most useful, and fastest frontier model that we've ever launched.

(00:06:33):
On pure SMARTs, one way to look at that is academic benchmarks on many of the standard ones, whether or not it's math, or reasoning, or just raw intelligence. This model is state of the art. I'm especially excited about its performance on coding, whether or not that's SWE-bench, which is a common benchmark, or actually front-end coding is really, really good as well, and that's an area where I feel like there's the true step change improvement in GPT-5. But really, no matter how you measure the SMARTs, it's quite remarkable, and I think people are going to feel the upgrade, especially if they weren't using o3 already.

(00:07:13):
And the second thing beyond SMARTs is it's just really useful. Coding is one axis of utility, whether or not you have coding questions or you're vibe coding an app, but it's also a really good writer. I write for a living, internally, externally. I just wrote a big blog post that we published Monday, and this thing is such an incredible editor. And compared to some of the older models, it's got taste, which I think is really exciting. And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model. And it just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human in a way that is hard to articulate until you try it. So, feel good about that.

(00:08:06):
And yeah, as mentioned, it's faster. It thinks, too, just like o3 did, but you don't have to manually tell it to do that. It'll just dynamically decide to think when it needs to. And when it doesn't need to think, it just responds instantly, and that ends up feeling quite a bit faster than using o3 did. And then maybe the thing that's most exciting is that we're making it available for free, and that's one of those things that I feel like we can uniquely do at OpenAI. Because many companies, I think, if they have a subscription model like us, they would gate it behind their paid plan. And for us, if we can scale it, we will, and that just feels awesome. We did that with 4o as well. So, everyone is going to be able to try GPT-5 tomorrow, hopefully.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):
How long does something like this take? I don't know if there's a simple answer to this, but just how long have you guys been working on GPT-5?

Nick Turley (00:08:51):
We've been working on it for a while. You can view GPT-5 as a culmination of a bunch of different efforts. We had a reasoning tech, we had a more classic post-screening methodologies, and therefore, it's really hard to put a beginning on it, but it really is the end point of a bunch of different techniques that we began for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):
Can you give us a peek into the vision for where ChatGPT is going, GPT in general is going? If you look at on the surface, it's been the same idea with a much smarter brain for a long time. I'm curious where this goes long-term.

Nick Turley (00:09:28):
So, to maybe back up a bit, now, you think of ChatGPT as, "Is this going to be ubiquitous product?" Again, about 10% of the world population uses every week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):
Holy shit.

Nick Turley (00:09:39):
I think we have 5 million business customers now. It's an established category in its own right. But really, when we started, we set out to build a super assistant, that's how we talked about it at the time. In fact, the code base that we use is called SA Server. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base, but things always turn out a little bit differently. So, yeah, in some ways, that is still the vision. The reason I don't talk about it more than I do is because I think assistant is a bit limiting in terms of the mental model we're trying to create. You think of this very personified human thing, maybe utilitarian, maybe a... And frankly, having an assistant is not particularly relatable to most people, unless they're in Silicon Valley and they're a manager, or something like that. So it's imperfect.

(00:10:24):
But really, what we envision is this entity that can help you with any task, whether or not that's at home, or at work, or at school, really any context, and it's an entity that knows what you're trying to achieve. So, unlike ChatGPT today, you don't have to describe your problem in menu to detail because it already stands your overarching goals and has context on your life, et cetera. So, that's one thing that we're really excited about. The inverse of giving it more inputs on your life is giving it more action space. So, we're really excited to allow it to do, over time, what a smart, empathetic human with a computer could do for you. And I think the limit of the types of problems that you can solve for people, once you give it access to tools like that, is very, very different than what you might be able to do in a chatbot today. So, that's more outputs.

(00:11:19):
And I often think, "Okay, I'm a general intelligence. What happened if I became Lenny's intern, or something?" And I wouldn't be particularly effective despite having both of those attributes that I just mentioned, and it's because I think this idea of building a relationship with this technology is also incredibly important. So, that's maybe the third piece that I'm excited about is building a product that can truly get to know you over time. And you saw us launch some of those things with improved memory earlier this year, and that's just the beginning of what we're hoping to do so that it really feels like this is your AI. So, I don't know if supersystem is still the right exact analogy, but I think people just think of it as their AI. And I think we can put one in everyone's pocket and help them solve real problems, whether or not that's becoming healthy, whether or not that's starting a business, whether or not that's just having a second opinion on anything. There's so many different problems that you can help with people in their daily life, and that's what motivates me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
So an interesting between the lines that I'm reading here is the vision is for it to be an assistant for people not to replace people. It feels like a really important piece of the puzzle. Maybe just talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:12:29):
AI is really scary to people, and I understand there's decades of movies on AI that have a certain mental model baked in. And even if you just look at the technology today, everyone, I think, has this moment where the AI does something that was really deeply personal to them and you're thought, "Hey, AI can never do that." For me, it was weird music theory things where I was like, "Wow, this thing actually understands music better than I do," and that's something I'm passionate about. And so it's naturally scary. And I think the thing that's been really important to us for a long time is to build something that feels like it's helpful to you, but you're in the driver's seat, and that's even more important as the stuff becomes agentic, the feeling of being in control, and that can be small things.

(00:13:15):
We built this way of watching what the AI is doing when it's in agent mode. And it's not that you actually are going to watch it the whole time, but it gives you a mental model and makes you feel in control in the same way that, when you're in a Waymo, you get that screen, for those of you who've tried Waymo. You can see the other cars. It's not like you're going to actually watch, but it gives you the sense that you know how this thing works and what's happening, or we always check with you to confirm things. It's a little bit annoying, but it puts you in the driver's seat, which is important. And for that reason, we always view technology and the technology that we build as something that amplifies what you're capable of, rather than replacing it, and that becomes important as the deck gets more powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:53):
Okay. So you mentioned the beginnings of ChatGPT. I was reading in a different interview. So you joined OpenAI. ChatGPT was just this internal experimental project that was basically a way to test GPT-3.5, and then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it, maybe see if people find this interesting," yada yada, yada. It's the most successful consumer product in history, I think both in growth rate in users and revenue, and just absurd. Can you give us a glimpse into that early period before it became something everyone is obsessed with?

Nick Turley (00:14:24):
Yeah. So we had decided that we wanted to do something consumer-facing, I think, right around the time that GPT-4 finished training, and it was actually mainly for a couple of reasons. We already had a product out there, which was our developer product. That's actually what I came in to help with initially, and that has been amazing for the mission. In fact, it's grown up. And now, it's the OpenAI platform with, I don't know, 4 million developers, I think. But at that time, it was early stage, and we were running into some constraints with it because there was two problems. One, you couldn't iterate very quickly because, every time you would change the model, you'd break everyone's app. So, it was really hard to try things.

(00:15:03):
And then the other thing was that it was really hard to learn because the feedback we would get was the feedback from the end user to the developer to us. So it was very disintermediated, and we were excited to make fast progress towards AGI and it just felt like we needed a more direct relationship with consumers. So we were trying to figure out where to start. And in classic OpenAI fashion, especially back then, we put together a hackathon of enthusiasts of just hacking on GPT-4 to see what awesome stuff we could create and maybe ship to users, and everyone's idea was some flavor of a super assistant. They were more specific ideas, like we had a meeting bot that would call into meetings, and the vision was maybe it would help you run the meeting over time. We had a coding tool, which full circle now, probably ahead of its time. And the challenge was that we tested those things, but every time we tested these more bespoke ideas, people wanted to use it for all this other stuff because it's just a very, very generically powerful technology.

(00:16:04):
So, after a couple of months of prototyping, we took that same crew of volunteers, and it was truly a volunteer group, right? We had someone from the supercomputing team who had built an iOS app before. We had someone on the research team who had written some backend code in their life. They were all part of this initial ChatGPT team, and we decided to ship something open-ended because we just wanted a real use case distribution. And this is a pattern with AI, I think, where you really have to ship to understand what is even possible and what people want, rather than being able to reason about that a priori. So, ChatGPT came together at the end because we just wanted the learnings as soon as we could, and we shipped it right before the holiday thinking we would come back and get the data and then wind it down. And obviously, that part turned out super differently because people really liked the product as is.

(00:16:56):
So I remember going through the motions of like, "Oh, man, dashboard is broken. Oh, wait, people are liking it. I'm sure it's just going viral and stuff is going to die down," to like, "Oh, wow, people are retaining, but I don't understand why." And then eventually, we fell into product development mode, but it was a little bit by accident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):
Wow. I did not know that ChatGPT emerged out of a hackathon project. Definitely the most successful hackathon project.

Nick Turley (00:17:21):
I like to tell this story when we do our hackathons because I really do want people to feel like they can ship their idea, and it's certainly been true in the past, and we'll continue to make it true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):
If you don't want to share these things, but I wonder who that team was.

Nick Turley (00:17:34):
The team is largely still around. Some of the researchers working on GPT-5, actually, were always part of the ChatGPT team. Engineers are still around. Designers are still around. I'm still here, I guess. So, yeah, you've got the team still running things, but obviously, we've grown up tremendously, and we've had to because with scale comes responsibility. And we're going to hit a billion users soon and you have to begin acting in a way that is appropriate to that scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
Okay. So let me spend a little time there. So, I don't know if this is 100% true, but I believe it is that ChatGPT is the fastest growing, most successful consumer product in history. Also, the most impactful on people's lives. It feels like it's just part of the ether of society now. It's just my wife talks to it. Every question I have, I go to it, voice mode. My wife is just like, "Let me check with ChatGPT." It's just such a part of our life now, and I think it's still early. So many people don't even know what the hell is going on. Just as someone leading this, do you ever just take a moment to reflect and think about just like, "Holy shit"?

Nick Turley (00:18:45):
I have to. It's quite humbling to get to run a product like that, and I have to pinch myself very frequently, and I also have to sometimes sit back and just think, which is really hard when things are moving so quickly. I love setting a fast pace at the company, but in order to do that with confidence, I need at least one day every week that I'm entirely unplugged and I'm just thinking about what to do and process the week, et cetera.

(00:19:14):
And the other thing is I've never ever worked on a product that is so empirical in its nature where, if you don't stop, and watch, and listen to what people are doing, you're going to miss so much, both on the utility and on the risks, actually. Because normally, by the time you ship a product, you know what it's going to do. You don't know if people are going to like it, that's always empirical, but you know what it can do. And with AI, because I think so much of it is emergent, you actually really need to stop and listen after you launch something and then iterate on the things people are trying to do and on the things that aren't quite working yet. So, for that reason alone, I think it's very important to take a break and just watch what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):
Okay. So you take a day off every week... not off. Okay, that's not the right way to put it. You take a day of thinking time, deep work.

Nick Turley (00:20:12):
I need it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I need to hard unplug on a Saturday, or something like that. Obviously-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
On a Saturday [inaudible 00:20:16].

Nick Turley (00:20:16):
But it's just not possible otherwise. This has been a giant marathon for three years now. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Like a sprint marathon.

Nick Turley (00:20:26):
Sprint marathon, that's right, or interval training, or something. I don't know how to exactly describe the OpenAI launch cadence, but you've got to set yourself up in a way that is sustainable. Even if this wasn't AI and it didn't have the interesting attributes that I just mentioned, I think you would need to do that. But especially with AI, it's important to go watch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
So, along those lines, I talked to a bunch of people that work with you, that work at OpenAI. Joanne specifically said that urgency and pace are a big part of how you operate, that that's just something you find really important, to create urgency within the team constantly, even when you are the fastest growing product in history, growing like crazy. Talk about just your philosophy on the importance of pace and urgency on teams.

Nick Turley (00:21:08):
Well, it's nice of her to say that. Two things, with ChatGPT, when we decided to do it, we had been prototyping for so long and I was just like, "In 10 days, we're going to ship this thing," and we did. So, that was maybe a moment in time thing where I just really wanted to make sure that we go learn something. Ever since then, I spent so much time thinking about why ChatGPT became successful in the first place, and I think there was some element of just doing things where there was many other companies that had technology in the LLM space that just never got shipped. And I just felt like, of all the things we could optimize for, learning as fast as possible is incredibly important. So I just started rallying people around that, and that took different forms.

(00:21:55):
For a while, when we were of that size, I just ran this daily release sync and had everyone who was required to make a decision in it, and we would just talk about what to do and to pivot from yesterday, et cetera. Obviously, at some point, that doesn't scale, but I always felt like part of my role here, obviously, was to think about the direction of the product, but also to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat for our teams. And again, this is important anywhere, but it's especially important when the only way to find out what people like and what's valuable is to bring it into the external world. So, for that reason, I think it's become a superpower of OpenAI, and I'm glad that Joanne thinks that I had some part in that, but it really has taken a village.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I love this phrase, "the resting heart rate of your team". That's such a perfect metaphor of just the pace of being equivalent to your resting heart rate.

Nick Turley (00:22:46):
I actually learned that at Instacart, when I showed up there, because we were in the pandemic and it was all hands on deck. For a while, there was this... I think there was a company-wide stand-up because we disbanded all teams. We were just trying to keep the site up. And for me, I had been used to taking my sweet time and just thinking really hard about things, and that's important, but I really learned to hustle over there, and I think that's come in handy at OpenAI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:12):
Okay. So, along these same lines, I asked Kevin Weil, your CPO, what to ask you, and he said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?" Talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:23:22):
That's funny, we have a Slack emoji, apparently, for this now because I used to say that. Now, I try to paraphrase. Sometimes, I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, "Okay, why can't we do this now?" or, "Why can't we do it tomorrow?" And I think that it's a good way to cut through a huge number of blockers with the team and just instill... especially if you come from a larger company. At some point, we started hiring people from larger tech companies. I think they're used to, "Let's check in on this in a week," or, "Let's circle back next quarter to see if we can go on the plan." And I just, as a-

Nick Turley (00:24:00):
... on the plan and I just kind of as a thought exercise, always like people asking, "Okay, if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do?" That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good forcing function for understanding what's critical path versus what can happen later. And I've just always felt like execution is incredibly important. These ideas, they're everywhere. Everyone's talking about a personal AI, you might've seen news on that and I really think that execution is one of the most important things in the space and this is a tool. So, it's funny that that became a meme. It's like a little pink Slack emoji that people just put on whatever they're trying to force the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):
I was going to ask, what theme [inaudible 00:24:47]. So, it's a little pink, is there something in there like-

Nick Turley (00:24:48):
It's a Comic Sans emoji that says, is this maximally accelerated?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:53):
Okay. And so, the kind of the culture there is when someone is working on something, the push is, is this maximally accelerated? Is there a way we can do this faster? Is there anything we can unblock?

Nick Turley (00:25:02):
Yeah. And we use that sparingly, right? Because it needs to be appropriate to the context. There's some things where you don't want to accelerate as quickly as possible because you kind of want process. And we're very, very deliberate on that where your process is a tool. And one of the areas where we have an immense amount of process is safety. Because A, the stakes are already really high, especially with these models, GPT-5 which is a frontier in so many different ways. But B, if you believe in the exponential, which I do and most people who work on this stuff do, you have to play practice for a time where you really, really need the process for sure, sure, sure. And that's why I think it's been really important to separate out the product development velocity, which has to be super high from, for things like frontier models, there actually needs to be a rigorous process where you red team, you work on the system card, you get external input, and then you put things out with confidence that it's gone through the right safeguards.

(00:26:02):
So, again, it's a nuanced concept, but I found it very, very useful when we needed and for everything product development, you're a dead on arrival, so it's important to get stuff out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
We got to open source those memes so that other teams can build on this approach.

Nick Turley (00:26:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
So, interestingly with ChatGPT, and it's not a surprise, but not only is it the fastest-growing, most successful consumer product ever, retention is also incredibly high. People have shared these stats that one month retention is something like 90%, six month retention is something like 80%. First of all, are these numbers accurate? What can you share there?

Nick Turley (00:26:39):
I'm obviously limited on what exactly I can share, but it is true that our retention numbers are really exciting and that is actually the thing we look at. We don't care at all how much time you spend in the product. In fact, our incentive is just to solve your problem and if you really like the product, you'll subscribe, but there's no incentive to keep you in the product for long. But we are obviously really, really happy if over the long run, three month period, et cetera, you're still using this thing. And for me, this was always the elephant in the room early on. It's like, "Hey, this may be a really cool product, but is this really the type of thing that you come back to?" And it's been incredible to not just see strong retention numbers, but just see an improvement in retention over time even as our cohorts become less of an early adopter and more the average person, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:29):
Yeah. So, that note is something that I don't think people truly understand how rare this is when a product... The cohort of users comes, tries it out and then retention over time goes down and then it comes back up, people come back to it a few months later and use it more. It's called a smiling curve, a smile curve, and that's extremely rare.

Nick Turley (00:27:48):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's some smiling going on that's just on the team and I feel like have technology, some of it is not the product. I think people are actually just getting used to this technology in a really interesting way, where I find, and this is why the product needs to evolve too, that this idea of delegating to an AI, it's not natural to most people. It's not like you're going through life and figuring out what can I delegate? Certain sphere of Silicon Valley does that because they're in a self-optimization mode and they're trying to delegate everything they can. But I think for most people in the world it's actually quite unnatural. And you really have to learn, "Okay, what are my goals actually and what could another intelligence help me with?"

(00:28:26):
And I think that just takes time and people do figure it out once they've had enough time with the product. But then of course there's been tons of things that we've done in the product too, whether or not it's making the core models better, whether or not it's new capabilities like search and personalization and all that kind of stuff, or just standard growth work too, which we're starting to do. That stuff matters too, of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
So, you might be answering this question already, but let me just ask it directly. People may look at this and be like, "Okay, they're building this kind of layer on top of this God-like intelligence. Of course it will grow incredibly fast and retention will be incredible. What do you guys actually doing that sits on top of the model that makes it grow so fast and retain so much?" Is there something that has worked incredibly well that has moved metrics significantly that you can share?

Nick Turley (00:29:18):
One thing we've learned, I'll answer that question in a minute, but one thing we've learned with ChatGPT is that there really is no distinction between the model and the product. The model is the product and therefore you need to iterate on it like a product. And by that I mean obviously you typically start by shipping something very open-ended, at least if you're OpenAI [inaudible 00:29:38] that's kind of a playbook. But then you really have to look at what are people trying to do? Okay, they're trying to write, they're trying to code, they're trying to get advice, they're trying to get recommendations and you need to systematically improve on those use cases. And that is pretty similar to product development work. Obviously the methodology is a bit different, but discovery is the same. You got to talk to people, you got to do data science and you got to try stuff and get feedback.

(00:30:04):
So, that's one chunk of work that we've been very consciously doing is improving the model on the use cases people care about. And there's also such thing as vibes because I'm sure you know and that's one of the things that I'm excited about in GPT-5 is that the vibes are really good. So, that too is, we have a model behavior team and they really focus on what is the personality of this model and how does it speak and talk. So, there's that kind of work. I would say that's maybe a third of the retention improvements that we see or so just roughly. And then I think another third is what I would call product research capabilities. They're research driven for sure. They have a research component, but they're really new product features or capabilities. And search is one example of that where if you remember in the olden days, maybe 20 months ago or something, you would talk to ChatGPT and it'd be like, "As of my knowledge cut off..." Or, "I can't answer that because that happened to recently," or something like that.

(00:31:00):
And that is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive and for good reason. It just allows you to do more with the product personalization, like this idea of advanced memory where it can really get to know you over time is another example of a capability like that. I think that's another good chunk. And then the third stuff is the stuff you would do in any product and those things exist too. Not having to log in was a huge hit because it removed a ton of the friction. I think we had this intuition from the beginning, but we never got to it because we didn't have enough GPU or other constraint to really go do that. So, there's the traditional product work too. So, I often think about it as roughly a third, a third, a third, but really we're still learning and we're planning to evolve the product a ton, which is why I'm sure there's going to be new levers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:52):
You mentioned something that I want to come back to real quick. You said that it was something like 10 days from Hackathon to Sam tweeting about ChatGPT being live?

Nick Turley (00:32:01):
The Hackathon happened much earlier and we were prototyping for a long time, but at some point we basically ran out of patience on trying to build something more bespoke. And again, that was mostly because people always wanted to do all this other stuff whenever we tested it. So, it was 10 days from when we decided we were going to ship to when we shipped. And the research we'd been testing for a long time, it was kind of an evolution of what we'd called instruction following, which was the idea that instead of just completing the sentence, these models could actually follow you instructions. So, if you said summarize this, it would actually do so. And the research had evolved from that into a chat format where we could do it multi-turn. So, that research took way longer than 10 days and that kind of baking in the background, but the productization of this thing was very, very fast and lots of things didn't make it in.

(00:32:50):
I remember we didn't have history, which of course was the first user feedback we got. The model had a bunch of shortcomings and it was so cool to be able to iterate on the model. The thing I just talked about, treating the model as a product was not a thing before ChatGPT because we would ship in more hardware where there'd be a release GPT-3 and then we would start working on GPT-4 and these weird giant big spend R&D projects that would take a really long time and the spec was whatever the spec was and then you'd have to wait another year. And ChatGPT really broke that down because we were able to make iterative improvements to it just like software. And really, my dream is that it would be amazing if we could just ship daily or even hourly like in software land because you could just fix stuff, et cetera. But there's of course all kinds of challenges in how you do that while keeping the personality intact while not regressing other capabilities. So, it's an open field to get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
That's such a good example of is it maximally accelerated? Okay, we're going to ship ChatGPT 10 days.

Nick Turley (00:33:48):
[inaudible 00:33:48]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):
Holy moly. We've been talking about ChatGPT. Clearly it's kind of a chat interface. Everyone's always wondering is chat the future of all of this stuff? Interestingly, Kevin Weil made this really profound point that has always stuck with me when he was on the podcast that chat is actually a genius interface for building on a super intelligence because it's how we interact with humans of all variety of intelligence. It scales from someone at the lower end to a super smart person. And so, it's really valuable as a way to scale this spectrum. Maybe just talk about that and is chat the long-term interface for ChatGPT, I guess it's called ChatGPT.

Nick Turley (00:34:27):
I feel like we should either drop the chat or drop the GPT at some point because it is a mouthful. We're stuck with the name, but no matter what we do, the product will evolve. I think that I agree that there's something profound about natural language. It just really is the most natural form of communicating to humans and therefore it feels important that you should be communicating with your software in natural language. I think that's different from chat though. I think chat was the simplest way to ship at the time. I'm baffled by how much it took off as a concept. Even more baffled by how many people have copied the paradigm rather than trying out a different way of interacting with AI. I'm still hoping that will happen. So, I think natural language is here to stay, but this idea that it has to be a turn-by-turn chat interaction I think is really limiting.

(00:35:24):
And this is one of the reasons I don't love the super system analogy, even though we used to always use it is because if you think that way, then you kind of feel like you're talking to a person and GPT-5 it's amazing at making great front-end applications. So, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't have AIs that can render their own UI in some way. And you obviously want to make that predictable and feel good. But it feels limiting to me to think of the end-all-be-all interface as a chatbot. It actually kind of feels dystopian almost where I don't want to use all my software through the proxy of some interface. I love being in Figma, I love being in Google Docs. Those are all great products to me and they're not chatbots.

(00:36:07):
So, yes on natural language, but no on chat is where I would describe my point of view. And I'm just hoping in general that we see more consumer innovation on how people interact with AI because there's so many possibilities and you just got to try stuff. That's why chat stuck is we just did it and people liked it. So, I'm hoping that we see more there and we'll try to do our part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:31):
So, you mentioned that you kind of got stuck with this name ChatGPT. Maybe this is part of the answer, but I'm curious just are there any accidental decisions you guys made early on that have stuck and have essentially become history changing?

Nick Turley (00:36:45):
There's so many and it is funny, because you have no time to think about them and then they end up being super consequential. The day was one, we went from chat with GPT-3.5 to ChatGPT the night before, slightly better but still really bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:58):
What was it called before?

Nick Turley (00:36:59):
It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be successful product. We were trying to actually be as nerdy as we could about it because that's really what it was. It was a research demo, not a product. So, we didn't think that was bad. But I think that in the original release, making it free was a big deal. I don't think we appreciate that because the GPT-3.5 model was in our API for at least six months prior to that. I think anyone could have built something like this. It might not have been quite as good on the modeling side, but I think it would've taken off. So, making it free and putting a nice UI on it, very consequential in the way that you take for granted now. And this is why I think that A, distribution and the interface are continuously important even in 2025.

(00:37:48):
The paid business, which now it's a giant business both in the consumer space and in the enterprise space. The birth of that was just to turn away demand originally. It was not like we brainstormed, "Oh, what is the best monetization model for AI?" It was really what monetization model or what mechanism would allow us to turn away people who are less serious than the people who are really trying to use it? And subscriptions just happened to have that property and it grew into a large business. I think shipping really funky capabilities before they were polished is another thing where that feels like a tactical decision, but it became a playbook because we would learn so much. Remember when we shipped Code Interpreter, we learned so much after we shipped it. Now it's known as I think data analysis in ChatGPT or something like that just because we actually got real world use cases back that we could then optimize. So, I think there's been a lot of decisions over time that proved pretty consequential, but we made them very, very quickly as we have to, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
The $20 a month feels like an important part of this. Feels like everybody's just doing that now and-

Nick Turley (00:38:57):
On that one actually, I remember I had this kind of panic attack because we really needed to launch subscriptions because at the time we were taking the product down every time. It was, I don't know if you remember, we had this fail whale, there's a little [inaudible 00:39:09] generated poem on it. So, they were like, "We had to get this out." And I remember calling up someone I greatly respect who's incredible at pricing and I was like, "What should I do?" And we talked a bunch and I just ran out of time to incorporate most of that feedback. So, what I did do is ship a Google Form to Discord with, I think the four questions you're supposed to ask on how to price something-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:32):
[inaudible 00:39:32]?

Nick Turley (00:39:33):
Yeah, exactly. It literally had those four questions and I remember distinctly A, you [inaudible 00:39:38] a price back and that's kind of how we got to $20. But B, the next morning, there was a press article on you won't believe the four genius questions the ChatGPT team asked to price their... It was like if only you knew. So, there's something about building in this extreme public where people interpret so much more intentionality into what you're doing than might've actually existed at the time. But we got with the $20. We're debating something slightly higher at the time. I often wonder what would've happened because so many other companies ended up copying the $20 price point. So, I'm like, "Did we erase a bunch of market cap by pressing it this way?" But ultimately I don't care because the more accessible we can make this stuff, the better. And I think this is the price point that in Western countries has been reasonable to a lot of people in terms of the value that they get back.

(00:40:27):
And most importantly, we were able to push things down to the free tier semi-regularly and we always do that when we can [inaudible 00:40:35], but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):
So, the survey, just to give the official name, the Van Westendorp survey is how you guys ended up pricing ChatGPT?

Nick Turley (00:40:42):
It was the top Google result. This was before ChatGPT has real-time information. Otherwise, it could have maybe price itself, but it was Discord plus Google Form plus a blog post on that methodology that got us there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):
That is incredible. What a fun story. This is the survey that Rahul Vohra at Superhuman popularized in his first- round article-

Nick Turley (00:41:00):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Definitely don't bring me on here as a pricing expert, I think you have got better people for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):
Whether it was right or wrong, it is now the fastest-growing, insane revenue generating business in the world. So, I wouldn't feel too bad.

Nick Turley (00:41:16):
No, it worked out. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
It worked out. And by the way, I'm on the $200 a month tier, so there's clearly a room-

Nick Turley (00:41:22):
Thank you. Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:25):
... [inaudible 00:41:25]-

Nick Turley (00:41:25):
The story of that one is interesting too because originally the purpose of the Plus plan was to be able to ship first uptime and then be able to ship capabilities that we couldn't scale to everyone. And at some point it got so many people in the Plus tier that had just lost that property. So, the main reason we came up with the $200 tier is just we had so much incredible research that's actually really, really powerful. Like o3 Pro or tomorrow GPT-5 Pro and just having a vehicle of shipping that to people who really, really care is exciting even though it kind of violates the standard way a SaaS page should look, it's a little jarring to see the 10X jump. So, thank you for being a subscriber on that and thank you everyone else who's watching you subscribed to any tier, it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
I'm just going to throw a fishing line into this pond of are there any other stories like this? You shared this incredible story of Chat with GPT-3.5 being the original name, how you came up with pricing. Is there anything else?

Nick Turley (00:42:22):
Enterprise is interesting one too because we've seen so much incredible adoption in the Enterprise and it's sort of objectively crazy to try to take on building a developer business and a consumer business and an enterprise business and all at once. But the story there is in like month one or two, it was very clear that most of the usage was work usage, actually much more than today where you've got so many consumers on the product and it's kind of sort of transcended into pop culture. But at the time it was writing, coding, analysis, that kind of stuff. And we were pretty quickly in organically in 90% of Fortune 500 companies in a way that I had seen maybe at Dropbox back when that was my two jobs ago where we had a similar story. And since then there's been more PLG companies. But the real reason we did Enterprise, remember we were debating should we do enterprise or should we launch an iOS app because that's how small the team was.

(00:43:22):
The reason we did is we were starting to get banned in companies because they all felt rightfully or wrongfully that the privacy and deployment story, et cetera wasn't there. So, I was just like, "Man, we have to do something. We're going to miss out on a generational opportunity to build a work product." And we've literally defined AGI as outperforming most humans at economically valuable work or I'd probably [inaudible 00:43:45] that, but I think that's the way we put it. And so, I feel like we had to be present there and it was a fairly quick decision at the time, but it's grown into an immense business. We just hit 5 million business subscribers up from 3 million, I think a month or two ago. So, it is kind of the spinoff that it's taking a life of its own that I'm really, really excited about for [inaudible 00:44:11]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):
That is a lot to be handling the platform essentially the API, the consumer product, the fastest-growing, most successful product in history and also the B2B side, which is clearly a massive business. Do you have any kind of heuristics for how to make these trade-offs do all this at once and stay sane and be successful?

Nick Turley (00:44:30):
That's a good question. And first off, I don't run the developer stuff anymore. We found someone way more competent to do that and he's amazing. So, I still look after the various forms of chat, but luckily you don't have to make that trade-off OpenAI does. And I can get into that too, but it keeps me a little bit more sane. I will say that you kind of have to practice in two different ways when you're building on this AI stuff. One is sort of working backwards from the model capabilities and that is much more art than science, where I think you really need to look at what tech do we have available and what is the most awesome way to productize it? And if you applied to some sort of PM framework to that, I think you would do something horrible wrong. Because if you have tech that's, for example, GPT-5 is really, really good at front-end coding now, I think that means you've got to reprioritize it.

(00:45:27):
You got to actually bring that capability to life. Maybe that's making ChatGPT better at vibe coding and rendering applications. Maybe that's more like leveraging the taste of the model to make the UI more expressive. There's a number of things we could do, but you kind of have to replan and reprioritize and that is more important than any particular audience segmentation. It's really just looking at what is the magic thing we have and how do you make it shine. Voice is a similar thing. It wasn't like our customers need voice, they're begging for it or something like that. It was like, "Wow, we figured out a way how to make these things anything in, anything out." What is a creative awesome way to productize that and then we can see what people do. So, I think that's one chunk of it. But then the other chunk of it really is more like classic product management where you need to listen to customers and then when your customers are really different, that can be confusing because ChatGPT is a very general purpose product.

(00:46:23):
We see when you look at end users, there's actually an immense amount of overlap in terms of what they want. Primitives like projects or history search or sharing and collaboration, all those kinds of things. They are actually very, very present. Whether or not you're talking to people at work or you're talking to people at home, at school, there's slightly different mechanics sometimes, but they're largely similar investments that I think we can get a lot of mileage out of. And then there's Enterprise-specific work that we just have to do. You've got to do HIPAA, you got to do SOC 2, you've got to do all those things if you want to be a serious player. And those are just non-negotiable. So, it's complex as you correctly identified, but it's kind of the curse of working on a very open-ended and powerful technology.

(00:47:11):
One analogy that someone at OpenAI who I really respect, he's like, "We're kind of like Disney, where Disney has this one kind of creative IP, which is their content, and they have cruises and they have theme parks and they have comics and they have all these different things." And I think we have amazing models, but there's all these different ways that you can productize them and we kind of just have to maximize the impact in all these different ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:38):
As you were talking, I was thinking about how usually horizontal platforms that are just so general and can do so much take a long time to take off because people don't know what to do with them. They're not amazing at anything. And this is an amazing counter example where it took off immediately and everyone figured it out and then over time they figured it out more and more.

Nick Turley (00:47:54):
But I think the reason why is because it just went live. Talk about another consequential decision actually. We were debating waitlist, no waitlist because we-

Nick Turley (00:48:00):
Actually we were debating waitlist/no waitlist because we really knew we couldn't scale the engineering systems. And the fact that there was no waitlist, which no open AI release had worked like that before, ended up being consequential because you were able to watch what everyone else was doing live. So I think when you launch these things all at once for everyone, there really is a special moment where you can see what other people are doing and learn from that.

(00:48:25):
And a lot of that is actually out of product. There's these crazy TikTok posts that go viral and they have like 2, 000 use cases in the comments. And I go through those in detail because it's not like I knew about those use cases either. They're very, very emergent and I just go through the comments and process because there's so much to learn. And for that reason, I think we get to skip the empty box problem a little bit because so much learning is happening out of product as people are watching each other either in IRL or online.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
That is so interesting because you think about Airtable, you think about Notion, all these companies, they took years to just build and craft and think and go deep on what it could be.

Nick Turley (00:49:04):
It's like they compare Airtable, which they had to do templates, they had to do all these kind of things of taking the horizontal product and making it use case driven. They compare it to the Instant Pot, which there's recipes being shared everywhere online. There's this whole ecosystem around it. I think we were really lucky with ChatGPT that that happened where there's just users sharing use cases with other users everywhere. And therefore I think we got very lucky by jumping ahead on that journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):
And it feels like a quarter there is Sam had big following and everyone would pay attention to something you launch. So that's a really interesting new strategy for launching horizontal product. With a huge distribution channel, just launch it and see what comes up.

Nick Turley (00:49:51):
Yeah. And of course I'm actually really excited to take some of that into the product. I think we shouldn't rest on the fact that there's so much out product discovery happening. I actually think for the average consumer, it would be amazing if the product did a little bit more work on really exposing to you what is possible.

(00:50:07):
I still feel like ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS, like we haven't built Windows yet. And it'll be obvious once we do, but there's something that feels a little bit like... Imagine MS-DOS had gone viral and you were just trying to hack little conversation starters onto it. That might've missed sort of the big picture in terms of how to really communicate affordances and value to people. And so I think there's actually a ton more product work to do in addition to just seeing use cases spread.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:33):
Are you able to share just what you think that might look like? This Windows version of ChatGPT?

Nick Turley (00:50:37):
I'll let you know when we figure it out. We're hiring. I think there's so many interesting product problems here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):
Okay, got it. By the way, I also love that TikTok was like your feedback channel.

Nick Turley (00:50:49):
Those common threads, they're just so wild. And also the love that people have for it, the excitement with which you're sharing their product, I feel like it's special that people are so excited to share what they're doing with your product. And I don't take that for granted either.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:06):

(00:52:13):
How do you find emerging use cases these days? I imagine the volume is very high. Do you have kind of a trick for figuring out, "Oh, here's a new thing we should really think about?"

Nick Turley (00:52:22):
Before I built the product team, I actually built the data science team because I was getting frustrated. I was talking to as many users as I could. And my calendar the weeks after ChatGPT, it was just 15 minute user interview the whole week through. It was usually I stopped doing interviews when I can predict what the next person's going to say. That's how I know I've talked to enough users, but it just wasn't happening. I just kept getting new stuff.

(00:52:46):
So data is one way out where I think we have conversation classifiers that without us having to look at the conversations, allow us to figure out what are people talking about, what use cases are taking off, et cetera. And I think that's very, very helpful. The quality of the stuff is important for empathy. Even though you're never going to get a rap on all the use cases people have, I still spend a huge amount of my time doing that. And then yeah, things like those TikToks, collections of threads, I think they're really, really useful. It's just fun to watch people talk to each other about the various use cases that they have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:22):
Is there kind of a new margin use case that you're excited about or is there a really unusual use of ChatGPT that you think about that'd be fun to share?

Nick Turley (00:53:30):
I mentioned this earlier, but I had always conceptualized ChatGPT as a worky product, whether or not you're at home or you at work. I feel like getting help with your taxes is very similar to the types of things you do at work where planning a trip is actually very similar to planning an event for work. So I always felt like, "Okay, this thing is going to kind of be a productivity tool."

(00:53:51):
And I think something has happened, I realized, a few months where that has begun to change and I really do think the fact that you have consumers turning to this thing for day-to-day advice, helping them have better relationships... People talk about how this thing saved their marriage is really exciting to me because they use it to process their own emotions, get feedback on their communication style. They just have a buddy to talk to about really difficult things. And that comes with a ton of responsibility and work that we have to do to make those things like life advice great, but it also is really, really important to me because you can't run away from those use cases. You have to run towards them and make them awesome. And that's part of what we're trying to do. So that emergent behavior is really, really cool.

(00:54:41):
And more broadly, I'm so excited about education. I'm so excited about health. I think it would really be a waste if we didn't take the opportunity of using ChatGPT to really, really help people. And I think we've just begun to scratch the surface on that. So there's many aspirational use cases that I want to make happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
Along those lines, an interesting use case I've recently had, I feel like it's going to be really helpful for couples that are disagreeing about something when they need a third opinion. I just had this recently where my wife's like, "You can't heat a whole thing that you're going to only eat part of in the microwave and then put it back in the fridge." It's like, "What's the problem? I'll heat it up, I'll put it back in the fridge." And she's like, "No, that's really dangerous." I'm like, "Let's ask ChatGPT." And that fact that she so trusts ChatGPT now and relies on it throughout the day, it's such a valuable third independent party that we can go to.

Nick Turley (00:55:35):
Yeah, yeah, totally. And a lot of those micro-interactions talk about interesting product work, right? Those are micro-interactions that are important. Did it definitively weigh in or did it help you guys think through that disagreement and solve it on your own? I think those details actually matter a lot and it's where we're spending a bunch of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:54):
Along those lines, there was this whole launch of the very sycophantic version of ChatGPT where it was just, " You are the best person in the world. Everything you tell me is amazingly correct." Are you able to tell us just what happened there?

Nick Turley (00:56:08):
Yeah, we have all kinds of collateral online because we really felt like we should over-communicate on how we discovered it, what we did about it, et cetera. So I encourage people to check that out. We have a whole retro on that model release.

(00:56:24):
But basically what happened is that we pushed out an update that made the model more likely to tell you things that sound good in the moment, "You're totally right. You should break up with your boyfriend" or something like that. That's just really dangerous. We took it more seriously than you even might expect because again, at current technology levels, you can kind of laugh about it. Maybe it's like, "Ha-ha. This thing's always complimenting me. I thought it was just me. I saw all those comments online." But it actually is really important to make sure that these models are optimized for the right things.

(00:57:01):
And we have an immense, I think, luxury to have a mission that affords us to really help people, a business model that does not incentivize maximizing engagement or time spent in the product, right? So it's really important to us that you feel like this product is helping you with your goals, whether not that's your current goals or even your long-term goals.

(00:57:25):
And oftentimes being extremely complimentary with the user isn't actually in service of that. So we instilled new measurement techniques. Whenever we put these models in contact with reality and we learn about a problem, we actually go back and make sure we have good metrics for this stuff. So we measure sick efficiency now with every release to make sure we don't regress and actually improve on that metric. GPT-5 is an improvement, which is really exciting for me, but we have more work from there.

(00:57:54):
And more broadly, it caused us to articulate our point of view. I actually spent a bunch of time on a blog post that we just published on Monday on what we're optimizing ChatGPT for. And it really is to help you thrive and achieve your goals, not to keep you in the product. And so there was a bunch of good outcomes from that incident. It's a good example of how contact for reality is not just important for the use cases, but also for learning what to avoid because you would've never discovered this issue purely in a lab unless you actually heard from physicians.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):
I am excited to read that blog post then. I was going to ask you this. Just like how you-

Nick Turley (00:58:29):
Yeah, have your feedback on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:31):
Yeah. I guess is there anything more there of just how you... Because this tension is so difficult, helping people feel supported, but not just letting them believe everything they want to believe. Is there anything more you can share there? Just trying to find that middle ground.

Nick Turley (00:58:43):
Incentives are important. There is a famous saying, "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:48):
Charlie Munger maybe?

Nick Turley (00:58:49):
Yeah, I think that's where it came from, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
Yeah.

Nick Turley (00:58:52):
Yeah, I think that's very, very important. So I would take a good look at our mission, our business model, the type of product we're trying to build. And I really think that ChatGPT is a very special product because I think in vast majority of cases, it makes you leave it feeling better or not worse and feeling like you're achieving something you're trying to do. So I think that those incentives really matter because it helps you reason about, "Okay, when there isn't behavior in the wild, that's not good. Was that a bug or was that by design? And with [inaudible 00:59:29] I can very much say that to us that's a bug.

(00:59:31):
And then on the forward-looking work, there's so many kind of challenging scenarios to get right. And you could easily run away from these use cases. Like you and your wife going to this thing for input on a relationship, a question or a dispute, you could very easily run away if you were totally risk avoidant and say, " Sorry, I can't help you with that." I think that's what most tech companies do when they hit a certain scale, they run away from these use cases. And I think it's a lost opportunity to help people.

(01:00:08):
So we want to run towards these use cases by making the model behavior really, really great. That can mean connecting you with external resources when you're struggling. That can mean not directly answering your question, but instead of giving you a helpful framework in the case of like, "Should I break up with my boyfriend?" ChatGPT should probably not answer that question for you, but it should help you think through that question in the way that a thoughtful companion would. So I think it's really important to do the work because I think the upside is immense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
That is a really profound point you're making there, that if most companies, if their users want to ask them something risky like getting medical advice or, "Should I break up with my partner?" or, "what should I do with this big problem I have?"

Nick Turley (01:00:51):
I feel like we would have immense regret if you had a model that was state-of-the-art on health bench, which is, GPT-5 is a state of the art on a bunch of these medical benchmarks, and you didn't use that to help people, you just disabled that use case because you wanted to avoid all possible downside. I think the duty is to make it awesome and to do the work, talk to experts, figure out how good it really is, where it breaks down, communicate that. And I think this technology is too important and has too much potential positive impact on people to run away from these high stakes excuses.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):
And fast-forward to today, it's saving lives regularly. It's probably saving relationships regularly. Such a consequential decision, which I imagine was made early on.

Nick Turley (01:01:36):
Yeah. We're just at the beginning of watching how this stuff can transform people. It's incredibly democratizing. If you compare, you roll out of this with the roll out of the personal computer, computers were so scarce when they first came out. And this stuff is ubiquitous in a way where you have access to a second opinion on medical stuff, you have access to a relationship buddy, you have access to a personal tutor on literally any topic that makes you curious. It's really, really special that we get to do that. Unique point in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):
Let me zoom out a bit and talk about OpenAI and just product in general. So you've worked at traditional, let's say traditional product companies, Dropbox, Instacart. Now you're at OpenAI. What's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned by building products from your time at OpenAI?

Nick Turley (01:02:33):
Each time I always tried to pick the maximally different job whenever I made a job change. So after Dropbox, I was craving a real world product because it was just so different than working on SaaS, et cetera. And after Instacart, I was craving on working on something that intellectually was interesting and had this kind of invoked the nerd in me. And so I've always looked for things that are really different.

(01:02:59):
And then once I showed up at these places, I tried to understand what makes that place successful, what is truly the thing that they cracked and how we can lean in that into that even more.

(01:03:11):
I think I spent a lot of time thinking about this with OpenAI, especially after ChatGPT. Before that it was kind of a moot point because we didn't really have much revenue or products or anything like that. There's a few things that come to mind that have driven many decisions. One is the empiricism. We talked about that a bit. The fact that you can only find out by shipping, which is why maximally lean into that. And that's a huge part of why we ship so much.

(01:03:46):
One of them is that amazing ideas come from anywhere. The thing about running a research lab is you really don't tell people what to research. That's not what you do. And we inherited that culture even as we become a research and product company. So just letting people do things who have amazing ideas rather than being the gatekeeper or prioritizer of everything or something like that has been proven immensely valuable to us. And that's where much of the innovation comes from, is empowered smart people on any function really. So that was a good inheritance from what I think made OpenAI successful and makes us successful.

(01:04:23):
The interdisciplinariness of really making sure that you put research and engineering and design and product together rather than treating them as silos. I think that's the thing that has made us successful and that you see come through in every product we ship. Like if we're shipping a feature and it doesn't get 2X better as the model gets 2X smarter, it's probably not a feature we should be shipping. Not always true. SOC 2 doesn't get better with [inaudible 01:04:48] models, but I think for many of the core capabilities, that's a good litmus test.

(01:04:52):
So I've always found you really have to lean into why is this place successful and then maximally accelerate that, so to speak, because it's what allows you to turn something that feels like an accident into something that is a repeatable label.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
So you talked about this kind of collaboration between researchers and product people. And you've been at the beginning of ChatGPT from day one to today, from zero to 700 million weekly active users. Not just registered users, weekly active users. How have you approached building out that team over time?

Nick Turley (01:05:24):
One of the other inheritances of being in a research lab is that you take recruiting really seriously. That's something that AI labs know every person matters. But many tech companies that go through hyper growth and they kind of lose their identity, they lose their talent bars, they just have chaos. So we've always had this tendency to run relatively lean.

(01:05:51):
So it is a small team that is running ChatGPT. I take co inspiration from WhatsApp where it was a very small team running a very global-scale product. And then more importantly, you have to treat hiring a little bit more like executive recruiting and less like just pure pipeline recruiting where you really need to understand what is the gap you're trying to fill on each team, what is the specific skill set and how do you fill it.

(01:06:17):
To give you an example, I'm a product person at heart, but sometimes a team doesn't need a product person because there's already someone doing that role. In many cases, we have a really talented engineering leader who has amazing product sense, or we have a researcher who has product ideas. And in my mind they can play that role. And maybe we have something else missing instead. Maybe we need a little bit more front-end or something like that.

(01:06:41):
In other cases, maybe what you're missing is incredible data scientists. So I really like to go through every single team and figure out what is the skill sets that that team needs and how do you put it together from principles rather than just assuming, "Hey, we're going to do a bunch of pipeline recruiting for all these different roles" and then people will find a team later. So I think that's always felt really important to me. And it's the way that you keep your team really small, yet super high throughput.

(01:07:08):
It also allows you to hire people who I think Keith Rabois calls us like barrels, I think. [inaudible 01:07:15] barrel's an ammunition where he thinks... I think this comes from him, but the idea being that sort of the throughput of your org depends on how many barrels you have, which is people who can make stuff happen. And then you can add ammunition around them, which is people helping those people. I think that's been really true for our recruiting too where we try to maximize the number of empowered people who can ship because that's how you have a small team and still get the ton done.

(01:07:43):
So there's a couple of things, and I spent a lot of time on vibes too with each team because I think one of the things that is challenging when you try to do research and product together is that the cultures are different. People have different backgrounds. And I think to make that go super well, you need to spend time team building and making sure that people have a huge amount of trust for each other's skill sets, feel like they can think across their boundaries. I really believe that product is everyone's job, for example. And for that reason, the recruiting doesn't stop when the people are on the door. It actually starts because you have to start making the teams awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):
Is there something you do with team building that would be fun to share? Just like something you do to create [inaudible 01:08:28]?

Nick Turley (01:08:28):
I just love whiteboarding with teams. I just love getting into a generative mindset. It breaks down everything. So that's the thing that I try. It's not particularly creative, but I found it to be a universal tool where the minute you can get people to stop thinking about what's my job versus the other person's job and more like we're all in a room trying to crack something together, that is incredible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
You mentioned this idea of first principles. This came up actually when I talk to a lot of people about you, is this something you're really big on. A lot of people talk about first principles, most people are like, " I don't really understand," or they think they're amazing at thinking from first principles. Is there something you can share of just what it actually looks like to think from first principles as maybe an example that comes to mind where you really went to first principles and came up with something unexpected?

Nick Turley (01:09:15):
Yeah, this is not something I'd ever say about myself. It's nice that someone else would say it, but it's a mysterious thing. Yeah, I think you just really got to get to ground truth on what you're really trying to solve. For example, as I mentioned with the recruiting thing, I'm not dogmatic that you have to have a product manager and an engineering manager and a designer or whatever. We're just trying to make an awesome team that can ship. So in that case, first principles means just really understanding what we actually need and what we're missing rather than applying a previously learned process or behavior. So I think that's a good example.

(01:09:54):
Another good example of I think being first principles in this environment is, does this feature need to be polished? We get a lot of crap for the model chooser, and I own it. I've tried to say that to everyone who will listen. For those who don't know model chooser, it's this giant drop down in the product that is literally the anti-pattern of any good product traditionally.

(01:10:16):
But if you are actually recent from scratch, is it better to wait until you got a polished product or to ship out something raw even if it makes less sense and start learning and getting into people's hands? I think a company with a lot of process or a lot of just learned behaviors will make one call, which is, we have a quality bar when we ship, and that's what we do. If your first principle is about it, I think you're like, "You know what? We should ship. It's embarrassing, but that's strictly less bad than not getting the feedback you wanted."

(01:10:51):
So I think just approaching each scenario from scratch is so important in this space because there is no analogy for what we're building. You can't copy an existing thing. There is no, "Are we an Instagram or are we a Google or a productivity tool or something like that?" I don't know. But you can learn from everywhere, but you have to do it from scratch. And I think that's why that trait tends to make someone effective at OpenAI, and it's something we test for in our interviews too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
So this theme keeps coming up, and I think it's just important to highlight something that you keep coming back to, which is this trade-off of speed and polish and how in this space, speed is more important, not just to stay ahead, but to learn what the hell people actually want to do with this thing. Is there anything more that you think people just may be missing about why they need to move so fast in the space of AI?

Nick Turley (01:11:46):
Yeah. I mean, the boring answer would be, oh, it's competitive and everyone's in AI and they're trying to compete each other. I think that's maybe true, but that's not the reason that I believe this. The reason really is that you're going to be polishing the wrong things in the space. You absolutely should polish-

Nick Turley (01:12:00):
You're going to be polishing the wrong things in this space. You absolutely should polish things like the model output, et cetera, but you won't know what to polish until after you ship. And I think that is uniquely true in an environment where the properties of your product are emergent and not knowable in advance. And I think that many people get that wrong because they think the best product people tend to be craftspeople and they have a traditional definition of craft. I also think it would be easy to use all what I just said as an excuse not to eventually build a great product. So I often tell my teams that shipping is just one point on the journey towards awesomeness, and you should pick that point intentionally where it doesn't have to be the end of your iteration at all. It can be the beginning, but you better follow through.

(01:12:50):
So we've been doing a bunch of work, especially over the last quarter of really cleaning up the UI of ChatGPT. I'm really excited to do the same for the sort of the response layouts and formats next. Simply because once you know what people are doing, there's no excuse to not polish your product. It's just really, in a world where you don't know yet, you might get very distracted.

(01:13:09):
So it's situational. Again, you kind of have to be first principles about it. But I do think using velocity, especially early on, as a tool... Actually this has been said about consumer social for example. It is not the first space where people have said, "Hey, you just got to try 10 things because you're probably going to be wrong." So I don't think this has never existed before as a dynamic either, but I do think with AI, it's important to internalize.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):
And there's also an element of the models are changing constantly and so you may not even realize what they're capable of, I imagine.

Nick Turley (01:13:38):
Totally. The models are changing and the best way to improve them, whether or not you're a lab or actually just someone who's doing context engineering or fine-tuning a model maybe, you need failure cases, real failure cases, to make these things better. The benchmarks are increasingly saturated. So really you need real-world scenarios where your product or model is not actually doing the thing it was supposed to do, and the only way you get that is by shipping, because you get back to use case distribution and you can make those things good. And therefore, it's actually the best way to then go articulate to your team, especially your ML teams, what [inaudible 01:14:17] climb on? It's like, "Oh, people are trying to do X and the model's failing in ways. Why? Now let's make those things really good."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):
This point about failure cases makes me think about something that both Kevin Weil and Mike Krieger shared, which is that evals are becoming a huge new skill that product people need to get good at because so much of product building is now writing evals. Is there something there you want to share?

Nick Turley (01:14:41):
My entire OpenAI journey has been this journey of rediscovering eternal product wisdom and principles in like slightly new contexts. So I remember I started writing evals before I knew what an eval was because I was just outlining very clearly specified ideal behavior for various use cases until someone told me, "Hey, you should make an eval." And I realized there was this entire world of research evaluation benchmarks that had nothing to do with the product that I was trying to make. And I was like, "Wow, this might be the lingua franca of how to communicate what the product should be doing to people who do AI research." And that really clicked for me.

(01:15:23):
And at the end of the day, it's not that different from the wisdom of, you ought to articulate success before you do anything else. It's just a new mechanism for doing that. But you can do it in a spreadsheet, you do it anywhere, and I really wanted to mystify it for people who hear that term. It's not some technical magic that you have to understand. It's really just about articulating success in a way that is maximally useful for training bots.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:50):
Awesome. I have a post coming out soon that gives you a very good how-to for PMs have how to write evals.

Nick Turley (01:15:56):
I would love to read it. And I hope you agree with what I just said because maybe there's [inaudible 01:16:02] to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):
Absolutely. Absolutely. And now there's all these tools that make this easier for you.

Nick Turley (01:16:04):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):
Okay, so this basically backs up this point that this is just a very important skill that product teams and builders need to get good at.

Nick Turley (01:16:12):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:13):
Okay. Just a few more questions. I know you have a lot going on today. One is that this trend of ChatGPT being a big driver of growth for traffic to sites, for products. For example, ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter, which completely shocked me. I just was looking at my stats, I'm like, "What the hell? This is not something I knew was coming." So just I guess thoughts on the future of this, how you think about just ChatGPT driving growth and traffic to products and sites?

Nick Turley (01:16:48):
I'm really excited about it because in the same way that I find it dystopian to talk to everything through a chat bot, I also find it dystopian to not have amazing new high quality content out there. And for that reason, I talked a little bit earlier about search and have that solved a really important user problem early on because you had this knowledge cutoff thing and you suddenly could talk about anything. Very obvious in retrospect. A, it wasn't just a user problem, it was an ecosystem problem where the original ChatGPT, it didn't have outlinks, it would just answer your question, it would keep you in the product. And even if you wanted to keep reading or go deeper, there was no way for us to drive traffic back to the content ecosystem. And I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search, not just because it gives people more accurate answers, but because it allows us to surface really high quality content, like this podcast, to people who want to see it.

(01:17:47):
And of course there's so many interesting questions about, well in the Google era, there was the search engine optimization and there was clearly understood mechanisms of how to show up and get more traffic. So I get a lot of questions from people, like, "What is the equivalent of that? The AI era, if I'm Lenny and I want to 10X the traffic to my podcast, what do I actually need to do?" And the truth is we don't have amazing answers there simply because the way to appeal to an AI model ideally is the same way that you would appeal to a real user, because the model's supposed to proxy the interest of the user and nothing else. At least that's how I want our product to work. And for that reason, my advice is super lame, which is make really high quality content, which is not as actionable as I think people making content would ideally like. And I think this is why we have more work to do because maybe there's a better mechanism or protocol that we could come up with.

(01:18:42):
But I'm excited this is driving meaningful traffic for you, and I hope that other people making great content start to feel this way because, again, it's a very new scenario.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):
There's two acronyms people have been using for this specific skill of AI driven SEO. I think one is AEO, which is answer engine optimization. The other is GEO. I forget the G one.

Nick Turley (01:19:04):
Generative... Yeah, I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):
Generative, yeah, AI optimization.

Nick Turley (01:19:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:08):
Do you have a favorite of those two? [inaudible 01:19:10]-

Nick Turley (01:19:10):
No, no. I try to shy away from these terms unless they become inevitable just because I'm not entirely sure yet if that should be a concept or not. Again, I think ideally, ChatGPT understands your goals and therefore understands what content would be interesting to you. And the content creator's job is to share enough information and metadata about that content such that the AI model can make a user-aligned decision. And therefore, I'm not sure if giving this thing a name and making a thing is what we should be doing or not. I'm very eager to learn from folks making content about what this could look like because. Again, we're still working through.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:59):
Along these lines, another question people think about is you have GPTs, which are kind of these custom GPT apps that you can build to answer very specific use cases. There's always this question of, you're going to build an app store where I can plug in my product into ChatGPT, monetize that. Is there stuff there that you could talk about that might be coming someday?

Nick Turley (01:20:19):
GPTs are cool. They're kind of ahead of their time in the sense that we built that kind of concept before you could really build very differentiated things. At least in the consumer space, your learning GPT is going to be pretty similar to what the model could already do out of the box. So it's mainly a way of articulating a use case to people, but it doesn't have enough tools yet to make something that feels like an app, so to speak.

(01:20:47):
Different in the enterprise by the way. We're seeing a ton of adoption of GPTs there because just every single company has very bespoke business processes and problems, etc. And it's a really, really useful tool there. They also have unique data that they can hook up to these things that it can retrieve over. So we've seen a lot of success there.

(01:21:05):
I think the idea is the right one, and I think we're going to figure out a good mechanism for it. Because when you have so much capability packed into AI, it feels really powerful to allow people to package that up in ways that have a clear affordance, a clear use case, and are differentiated from each other. I also would love it if you could start a business on ChatGPT. I think there really is a world where, as this thing hits a billion user scale, it can get you distribution, it can get you started on making something in the same way that people built on the internet and there was entirely new businesses to be built.

(01:21:41):
So I think we'll have more to share there in the future. GPT's was an early stab. And I'm just excited to evolve the thinking there as the models get good and our reach increases as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):
Amazing. That is really cool. I'm really excited to see what you guys do there. Okay. Completely different direction. Something that I know about you is you studied philosophy in college.

Nick Turley (01:22:02):
I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:02):
Computer science and philosophy, right? A combo.

Nick Turley (01:22:05):
Yeah. I started as a philosophy major and took one coding class because I really liked logic, and programming was most similar to that. And then I fell in love with coding and then eventually computer science, and I just kept doing more and more of it. But until then, I'd never really thought of myself as a technical person, so it was kind of a late discovery in my life that I'm very grateful for.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
What an incredible combination for someone leading this product [inaudible 01:22:30].

Nick Turley (01:22:30):
It's true. It is really coming in full circle in a way that I couldn't have predicted. The amount of questions you have to grapple with are truly super interesting. And philosophy, it's not a traditionally practical skill, but it does really teach you to think things through from scratch and to articulate a point of view, and I think that has come in handy numerous times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:51):
Is there a specific philosopher or school that has been most handy to you, or is there more just the general [inaudible 01:22:57]?

Nick Turley (01:22:56):
Oh, there's so many.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
okay.

Nick Turley (01:22:57):
I wrote my senior thesis on whether and why rational people can disagree, which also comes in handy when a lot of people with very different values have opinions on your model behavior or on how things should work. So I really like 20th century analytical philosophers. It's kind of dirty stuff, but I don't know if I have a favorite. It's too many to count. But that's the kind of stuff I like. And some of it ends up being quite analytical. You have let P be this theory of love and let Q be this other theory of love, and then you do some sort of symbolic manipulation. So it is just as much a brain thought exercise as it is... Or it's much more that than practical, but it taught me how to think in a way that continues to be pretty valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):
Incredible. What a cool combo of skills and background. Last question before we get to very exciting lightning round. So you were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart, now you're the PM of arguably the most consequential product in history. How did you land in this role? What was the story of joining OpenAI and taking on this work?

Nick Turley (01:24:10):
Every single career decisions I ever made, including my first one out of college, was just figuring out who are the smartest people I know that I want to hang out with and learn from, and can I work with them? And I don't know how to vet companies, I don't know how to really logically think through what space is going to take off or something like that, but I just do feel like I have a sense on people. And for Dropbox, I followed the head teaching assistant for a class that I was TA-ing. And for Instacart, I followed some of the smartest product people I knew. And for OpenAI, the person who recruited me, Joanne, I had messaged her about getting off the DALL·E waitlist and she said, "Only if you interview here." So she turned it into a reverse recruiting thing.

(01:25:02):
And initially, honestly, I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab and I was a product person and they said, "Don't worry, we'll figure it out." And they were sort of being cagey. And I thought they were being cagey because it's OpenAI and they can't share anything, but they were being cagey because we actually just didn't know yet at the time. So I showed up and I did everything under the sun and it definitely wasn't product. It was like, I think my first task was fix the blinds or something like that. And then I started sending out NDAs for people because they needed some operational help. And then I started asking, "Wait, why am I sending out NDAs? Oh, so we could talk to users." And I was like, "Talking to users, that sounds like the thing I know how to do." And I quickly stumbled into doing product work, and then eventually leading a bunch of product work. But it was organic by just showing up and doing what had to be done because, again, the company I joined was not a product company by any.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):
Wow. This is such a good example of, I don't know if you think of it this way, but when someone offers you a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask which seat. [inaudible 01:26:07].

Nick Turley (01:26:08):
Yeah, so I didn't know it was a rocket ship. I kind of got nerd sniped is what I would describe it as. Where as I prepared for the conversation to get off the DALL·E waitlist really, I just started reading about the space and that piqued the philosophy brain and then also actually the computer science brain. I was like, "Wait, this is cool." Then I started reading all the academic papers of that era. So it was intellectual itch and the people, but then I stayed for the product opportunity, obviously. Post ChatGPT, when that took off, realized that we'd built a rocket ship where we'd launched it while building it, maybe is the analogy. But I can't say that it felt like a hyped job or anything like that when I applied.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
So a lesson there is, as you said, follow the smartest people you know. There's also just this thread of follow things that are interesting to you. Just you playing with DALL·E led to this opportunity.

Nick Turley (01:27:10):
Yeah, yeah. And actually that's something we still test for is curiosity is an attribute that we think matters so much more than your ML knowledge. I'm not making a comment on research hiring. I think you do need some ML knowledge, I'm afraid. But for product and engineering and design people, and those kinds of functions, I actually think that if you are just curious about the stuff works, it doesn't matter at all if you've never done it before. In fact, if you were to filter for people who've done it before, you would have a very narrow filter of very lucky people rather than necessarily the best people you can get. So I think we've scaled that. Certainly what got me here, but I think it's actually, just generically, been a good predictor of success at OpenAI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:50):
Nick, I told you I had a billion... I said I had 2 billion questions to ask you. I feel like I've asked a lot. I feel like I still have a billion left. But I know, you told me right after this you, have a big GPT- 5 check-in that you got to get to. So-

Nick Turley (01:28:01):
We got to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:03):
We got to ship. Better ship now that this is recorded and we're putting this out.

Nick Turley (01:28:08):
This is true. [inaudible 01:28:08].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:09):
This is the forcing function. Okay, so before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with, think is important to share?

Nick Turley (01:28:20):
I try to share a little bit about how I made decisions because I hope to... I'm not that far out of school. I relate a lot to people who are coming in the job market, who are trying to figure out what to do with their life right now. And I feel very confident that if you surround yourself with people that give you energy and if you follow the things you're actually curious about, that you're going to be successful in this era. So my parting advice to folks really is put yourself around good people and do the things you're actually passionate about. Because in a world where this thing can answer any question, asking the right question is very, very important. And the only way to learn how to do that is to nurture your own curiosity. So it worked for me and it's the one repeatable thing that I can share. Everything else is luck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:15):
This is counter to what a lot of people are doing right now, which is follow the money. Where can I make the most? How do I grow this thing and make $100 million? All these people that are getting these crazy offers were not planning to make a lot of money doing this.

Nick Turley (01:29:27):
It's quite interesting to see that stuff play out because I think all these people entered school for genuine reasons. They were excited about the space, they were researching it, they were pursuing knowledge, and I'm happy that that's being rewarded. And I don't know what the rewards will look like in the future, especially in a post-AGI world. But I just a feeling that if you follow that advice, you'll end up okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):
With that, Nick, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nick Turley (01:29:59):
Sure, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:00):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nick Turley (01:30:04):
In the product space, probably things like High Output Management or The Design of Everyday Things, or those kind of classic type things because I think they're extremely applicable in AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:13):
We talked about philosophy. I don't know, is there a philosophy book you're like, "Here's the one to read if you're getting into this."

Nick Turley (01:30:17):
Oh man. Anything by Rawls and Nozick. I like the political stuff. I think it's really fun. That is a type of thing I recommend. I don't think there's a practical reason to read that stuff, but I will nerd out about it with you. So at your own peril.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed? If you've had time to watch anything.

Nick Turley (01:30:36):
I think you've got to do a little bit of sci-fi to be in this space. You shouldn't copy any of it, but I think you learn from it. So regularly re-watch Her and Westworld. Severance was great. I think that's the stuff that, when I have time, I'll meddle with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):
That is awesome. I love that those are the two. Of all the sci-fi movies, those are the ones you resonate most with and find most interesting and valuable.

Nick Turley (01:31:03):
Yes, but that's probably my own limitation, so I'm sure there's more to discover.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:08):
By the way, have you read Fire Upon the Deep, that sci-fi book?

Nick Turley (01:31:08):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:13):
Okay. I don't know if you have time to read this book, but I think you would love it. It's such a good-

Nick Turley (01:31:16):
Oh, man. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):
... AI oriented sci-fi space opera sort of book.

Nick Turley (01:31:20):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:21):
Yeah.

Nick Turley (01:31:22):
I'll check it out, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:22):
Okay. Off tangent.

Nick Turley (01:31:22):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:26):
Okay. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Nick Turley (01:31:29):
I actually don't. I am at extreme capacity. It's kind of interesting. API developers ask me like, "Hey, are you going to copy all of our products?" It's like, I actually just do not have time to follow up what's going on outside of OpenAI because the pace here is so, so intense. So don't have good recs for you, I'm afraid.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:54):
That's a comforting answer, I think, to a lot of product companies. Go figure. Nick has no time to even listen to our stuff. Oh man. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using when things are tough, sharing with friends or family that other people find useful?

Nick Turley (01:32:10):
Being the average of the five people you spend the most time with is a thing that I really internalize, both in my personal life, where there's people who give me energy and who lift me up and make me a better person. My fiance is one of those people, but there's many people in my life. But then there's also just, at work, there's the equivalent. And again, that's how I've made all the career decisions. It's like who do I want to learn from? So I apply that principle constantly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:36):
Final question, everybody I talked to told me that you are a very good jazz pianist. You have won competitions. I think you were planning to do this as your main thing and then you somehow took the side quest.

Nick Turley (01:32:47):
Yeah, I chickened out that at the very last minute, but I was going to go to school for music. And that's still my, hopefully, chapter two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:55):
Wow. I love that that might still happen.

Nick Turley (01:32:58):
Might still happen. Now I'm in some for fun bands and we will kick from time to time. It's like the one thing I can do when I'm otherwise super tired and can't think anymore because it balances me out in good ways. But yeah, hopefully I'll get to do more of it in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):
Is there any analogs between music and your job? Anything that you find-

Nick Turley (01:33:20):
Yeah, actually. I feel like you could think of software development as, or being a product person, as you could be a conductor of an orchestra or you could be in a jazz band. And I think of it as a jazz band where I don't believe in the idea of everyone having this set part that they have to play and me kind of telling people when to play. I love how in jazz, or other forms of improvised music, you're kind of riffing off of each other and you listen to what one person played and then you play something back. And I think that great product development is like that, in the sense that ideas could come from anywhere. It shouldn't be a scripted process. You should be trying stuff out, having fun, having play in what you do. So I use that analogy a lot. For those who like music, it tends to resonate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:13):
Nick, I am so thankful that you made time for this. I know today is insane. Tomorrow's going to be even more insane for the entire world. They have no idea what's coming. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if you want them to find you online? Where can folks find GPT-5 potentially. And then just how can listeners be useful to you?

Nick Turley (01:34:31):
Just use the product. You don't even have to pay. Should be your default model starting tomorrow and just use it and don't think about models anymore. Unless you want to and you're a Pro user, in which case you get all the old models. So rest assured. And useful, honestly, I learned so much from people at large and ChatGPT users, et cetera, so just keep doing your thing. I am watching and learning, and I appreciate all the feedback. So I'm sure after we fix the model chooser, you guys will roast me for something else and I'll take it. So keep it coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:05):
Amazing. Nick, thank you so much for being here.

Nick Turley (01:35:08):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:09):
And good luck tomorrow.

Nick Turley (01:35:10):
Thanks.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:04):
When I asked in my newsletter Slack community who I should have on the podcast who's a bit under the radar, but amazing, Nickey Skarstad was the first name that I heard. And I was not surprised. I actually overlapped with Nickey at Airbnb, where she had a legendary reputation as a PM who everyone loved, but got shit done. Before Airbnb, Nickey worked at Etsy for over seven years where she went from being a forum moderator to director of product management. Then she went on to work at Airbnb for a couple years.

(00:00:31):
After leaving, she went on to be VP product at The Wing, and is currently a director of product management at Duolingo. In our conversation, we cover how to set vision, translate that into goals, and then how to execute on it, making your strategy actionable, and keeping your teams aligned and focused, designing your product review sessions, how to maintain product quality, and what skills have most contributed to her success in her career. I hope that you enjoy this conversation with Nickey Skarstad.

I am really excited for our chat and to get to learn from you. So welcome.

Nickey Skarstad (00:03:28):
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:30):
My pleasure. Today, you are director of product at Duolingo, which is an awesome product, and something that I used to use. I'm not learning a language currently, but I know where to go if I were to. Can you just talk about how you got into product, and then a bit about just your journey from that point to where you are today?

Nickey Skarstad (00:03:48):
Yeah, so it's been a long, meandering journey, which is fun. And so I've been in technology roles now for 12 years. I've been in PM roles, actually product roles, for 10. I'm starting to be the person with experience in the room, which is really fun and kind of daunting at times. But how I got my first role in product was I was at Etsy in 2010 is when I joined. And I joined them, I'd say it was post-product market fit, but before they truly started to really grow and scale. And I actually joined them on their community team. So I worked as a forums moderator, and then as a seller education specialist. Yeah. Spent a couple years doing that. And then through that process became sort of one of the internal voices that had a really good understanding of how their customer, one of their core customers, their sellers, were actually using their product.

(00:04:38):
And the VP product at the time, his name's Mark Headland. Hey Mark, if you're listening. Was like, "Hey, Nickey, you're in all these product meetings. Have you thought about being a product manager?" And at the time I was like, "Oh God, no. Never." I was like, "No. Technology what? Engineering? I'd have to work with engineers? I know nothing about engineering." And so I was very imposter syndrome-y about it. And he gave me a little nudge, and was like, "I think you'd be really good at it."

(00:04:59):
And so I tried it. And I started as an APM. And I was at Etsy for around, I think, it was seven years total, and spent the majority of time actually in PM product roles. So I left as a director of product. And for most of my time there, I worked on the seller side. So it was all seller tooling, working with sellers to figure out how they could grow and scale their businesses. And it was an awesome, wild ride. But that was my first role in product. And then I went on after that into several other product roles as well.

Lenny (00:05:27):
Yeah, let's get into it. Where'd you go next?

Nickey Skarstad (00:05:29):
So after seven years at Etsy, I was kind of getting the itch to try something new. When I took a step back and was like, all right, what do I want to do next? I really loved the marketplace component at Etsy. And I don't know if this is just says something about my personality, or actually probably your personality too, is marketplace product is really hard, right? You have this constant balancing of both buyer and seller sides or both sides of the marketplace. And I really liked that. And it was something that I was good at.

(00:05:54):
And so I was like, all right, where else could I go that's interesting or having a moment? And I was like, Airbnb. Has to be Airbnb. I was a huge fan of their product. They were also post-product market fit. But sniffed around, ended up basically getting an opportunity to join the experiences team. And I joined that team when the product had just launched. So they had done sort of their early thinking, the existential thinking. Had a brand new product in market, and then I joined the team.

(00:06:18):
And so I was the first boots on the ground product manager, and really helped that team figure out how do we get product market fit? And then how do we start to think about how to scale it, which was, you can imagine, experiences is interesting because it is a very nuanced product in that, and this is similar to Airbnb if you work on homes as well, but part of it is building the digital experience that someone will interact with when they're booking an Airbnb experience. And the other part is actually influencing the live event experience that you will experience when you actually join an event or an experience.

(00:06:52):
And I think that layer of abstraction for me was really fascinating, and something I've learned a ton about is it's not just influencing the digital product, but it's actually the consumer experience when their boots around the ground. And that is another layer of complexity. And so that was super fun. I was there for about, I think, a little over two and a half years. Started as a PM. I think I got promoted a couple times. Left as senior product lead, I believe was my title. And forever grateful for that experience because I learned a ton about product market fit and also product quality.

Lenny (00:07:23):
Is there anything else you took away from that experience? Because I was at Airbnb at the same time. We never really got to work together. But I just heard amazing things about you on the experiences team. And experiences was a wild ride, from what I understand. Is there anything that you took away from that experience that kind of has stuck with you as a PM?

Nickey Skarstad (00:07:39):
Yeah. So part of it is more of just the way Airbnb works is something that I think I use every day in my job, which is just truly thinking about product quality and the end consumer experience. And Airbnb does not ship product if it is not good. And even if they're trying new things, they are obsessed with the end consumer experience. And I learned so much from that line of thinking because just, if it shipped, it was really high quality. All the edge cases had been thought through. And the experience I had before that was definitely we were shipping things more quickly, things weren't always perfect. And it's not to say that everything Airbnb ships is perfect, but I think that obsession with the end consumer experience really influences the quality of their product suite and is something I try to bring to my job today because no one does it better, in my personal opinion.

Lenny (00:08:28):
I'd love to unpack that a little bit. There's kind of two questions in my mind. Is there an example of that at Airbnb where it's just like, okay, here's how they keep quality so high? And then do you have any advice for just how to do that as a company?

Nickey Skarstad (00:08:40):
Yeah. So I don't think that's easy for sure. One of the things Airbnb did for experiences is we had this balancing metric, which was basically using the review rate as sort our end all, be all top line goal. So you can imagine a business like that. Obviously we needed to have revenue kind of moving through the platform, and we cared about high level bookings. But really at the end of the day in the beginning, we were obsessed with making sure every person who booked actually had a good experience when they showed up to experiences.

(00:09:08):
And so especially if you are building early product, really thinking about how can you pick some good quality metrics that might actually balance or conflate with growth metrics, and use that as sort of your north star because it really helped the whole team to understand what they were actually trying to do at the end of the day. Growth was important, sure. Obviously we needed to grow for a lot of reasons. But the most important thing was that the actual customer experience was great. And I know Airbnb does that in other places too, but that really was experience's top line goal was our review rate and quality and it trickled down for sure.

Lenny (00:09:43):
How did they operationalize that? Because it sounds great. Cool, let's make sure everything, all the reviews are five star. How do you build that into the way the team operates and tracks their success?

Nickey Skarstad (00:09:53):
Yeah. So a big part of that was actually operational, which was just making sure that hosts who weren't meeting those specific rigorous standards. There was a lot of coaching and education that was happening. Some of that was in the product and some of it wasn't. It was something that was discussed at all of the meetings that we had across everyone's teams, right? Everyone understood that it was important. And so I think that really impacted both the ops team as well as the product team who are literally building the product that would bring that to life. And I think just thinking from, especially if you're a founder and you're thinking about building your sort of early metrics, there's a lot of ways to really make sure your team really understands what that means.

(00:10:33):
Another thing we did a lot on the experiences team is we just dogfooded all the time. And so we were lucky in that it's a really fun product to dogfood. We were taking experiences all over the world all the time. But it really helped because you would know right away when you showed up to an event, if you were going to have a five star experience or if it was not going to be great. I mean that really helped us too because then we would go back to the teams and be like, "All right, we were just in San Francisco. We were on an experience last night, and it did not go well. What do we do about it?" So there's lots of ways to do it. But dogfooding is a good one.

Lenny (00:11:02):
I know Brian is infamous for texting the team anytime anything isn't working right in the product. And I know he was very intimately involved in experiences. Is that something you've learned to do just to kind of like, "Hey team, I found a big problem. Let's fix it." Or do you try to avoid that and not create that stress?

Nickey Skarstad (00:11:20):
I mean I think sometimes that can be a healthy stress if you do it in the right way. The nice thing I think is just making autonomous teams that feel like it is their goal to bring that quality experience to life can help you avoid some of that. But I do think that pushing teams to use the product so they firsthand experience when it is not great is a really good way to give teams sort of the motivation to act on fixing things like that. But I don't know that I text people, but I'm on Slack all the time. So if anything, I'm going to Slack you.

Lenny (00:11:49):
Great. Okay. Maybe one more question on this topic because it's so interesting. So on experiences you measured, I imagine, percentage of trips that were five star. Are there other quality metrics that you've used at other companies that you found helpful for keeping track of product quality and maintaining product quality?

Nickey Skarstad (00:12:03):
Yeah. So another one that we used at Etsy, which was an interesting one, is we realized that, so one of the pieces of product that I owned was the onboarding flow. So it was onboarding new sellers specifically. And you can imagine if you're owning that flow, you're just going to be like, all right, we just need a ton of sellers, and we need them to open their shops right away. So we started and we went down that path. And then we realized we actually tanked a couple of downstream metrics that we didn't really understand at first. And those metrics were basically getting sellers to a first sale. So we opened up a lot of shops, but they actually weren't successful when they were on the platform, and they weren't successful in a certain amount of time.

(00:12:37):
So we did a lot of unpacking of what happened there, why did we do that, and actually does that matter? And the end answer was, yes, it matters greatly. When Etsy sellers are opening their shop, it's really important that you get them a sale right away because it's a huge motivator, right? If you make a sale in your first day, you're like, "Oh wow. Okay, this is a thing. I could make money doing this. This is exciting. I get to ship something to my buyer." If it takes you seven days, you start to be like, "Oh no. I'm not good enough. I'm terrible at this." 10 days, into 30 days, it really impacts people.

(00:13:06):
And so we actually put more friction in the onboarding flow to help to start to solve for that. So we actually slowed you down. We made you be more thoughtful about what you were listing. And by doing that, we actually helped you get to a first sale faster. And so that was another good example of a quality metric that we used, which was, I think it was first sale in seven days. I might be wrong. But something along those lines. And it actually conflated with the high level growth metrics, but it was a huge quality predictor, and it was really important for long term seller success.

Lenny (00:13:32):
So interesting. That's such a good topic. And I feel like we could explore that for an hour, but maybe for a little bit longer. Was that metric the metric that you used to measure supply growth at that point? Or was it alongside just general growth?

Nickey Skarstad (00:13:45):
Yeah, it was alongside general growth. It wasn't our top, top OKR. But it mattered because, again, it's sort of like you think about these things a bit as a seesaw, right? We basically were balancing our growth with making sure people were successful. And the more equilibrium you had there, the better it was for their overarching marketplace. And it's similar if you think about experiences too, right? Where, all right, you could just be growing, but people are having a terrible experience. So how do you balance those two things? And if you can get those two things in balance, you're going to cruise, and you're going to be more successful longer term.

Lenny (00:14:14):
Got it. At Airbnb when I was working on supply growth, our main goal for the supply growth team was similar. And that was actually the goal we had, which is new listings that got their first booking. We only counted listings that had one booking as new supply. Everything else didn't really count. Because we knew that if it got booked at least once, at least it's got some level of quality and people want that place, and it's valuable to the marketplace. Okay. So you were at Airbnb, and where'd you go next?

Nickey Skarstad (00:14:40):
Yeah. So I went to a startup. And for lack of a better way to describe this, they were basically kind of building a marketplace as well, but it was more of a marketplace of ideas. And I hate when people say that, because I think it's cheesy, but it's true. They had physical co-working spaces, and they were trying to take some of the magic that was happening in their spaces. So people meeting each other, networking, people getting funding for their startups, et cetera. And they wanted to bring it online and they wanted to try to scale it so it wasn't constrained inside of their four walls. So I helped them basically come up with a longer term strategy, start to figure out how to unpack that, and get product market fit. And then also just build a technology team around trying to solve that.

(00:15:16):
And so that started late 2019. And then I was out for a bit, had a baby. And came back and then COVID happened. And they were a physical co-working business. That was where their majority revenue came from. And so COVID was pretty horrible for what they were trying to do. They also had some other cultural issues, and so the whole thing kind of paused/fell over. So I actually spent a year hiring a team and then had to lay them off, which was a great lesson in leadership. I'm not going to lie. I learned a lot about how to lead in that experience.

(00:15:49):
But after that, and it was COVID, I had a eight month old, and so I spent time actually just vibing with my kids, which was kind of fun. And then ended up going to Shopify after that. And so I was looking for a more bigger scaled, not startup, and was trying to find something a little bit more something where I could be longer term and was more excited about, and took a platform role at Shopify. And so that was really interesting in that I had, honestly, for the most part spent the majority of my career in super consumer facing roles. And the role that I took was more platform.

(00:16:20):
And I realized that, honestly, pretty quickly after I took the role, I was like, oh, good to know. I didn't really understand what this job was and now I know what it is, but it does not give me energy. And so I felt like I had a lot of red energy every day. And so I made a call pretty quickly to bounce, which was actually another good learning experience. I think I've gotten a lot. As I've advanced through my career, have learned a lot about what gives me Nickey Skarstad energy and have been really prioritizing that, especially in a post-COVID world.

(00:16:46):
And so left Shopify, and made my way to Duolingo. And so Duolingo has been super fun. I've been there since September of 2021. And in the process of helping them kind of think through a zero to one product challenge, something that's newer. Can't really talk about it unfortunately, but has been another sort of product market fit thinking exercise. It reminds me a little bit of some of the work that I did on experiences. And so it's been actually pretty challenging. It's super fun. So I'm also having a great time here as well.

Lenny (00:17:12):
Amazing. The companies you worked at is incredible and there's so much I want to explore there. Going back to Shopify briefly, a lot of PMs, I imagine, are trying to decide should they stay where they're at? Should they go explore other places? So you said the thing that kind of pulled you out there was just the platform role didn't feel like a fit for you. Do you have any advice for folks on just how to know if a role or a company isn't a fit for them?

Nickey Skarstad (00:17:37):
Yeah. So I think I really learned that while I was there, and also I want to make sure I actually had a great experience at Shopify and I think it is an awesome company. I would highly recommend people work there, especially if they like platform product work. One of the things I did when I was like, I don't know if I love this is I actually went through my calendar and I changed the colors of all of the meetings on my calendar to red, yellow, and green after I had the meeting. And I looked. And basically if it was yellow, I was like, okay. It was a fine meeting. My energy was baseline. If it was red, I was either bored or I was stressed, or I was not having a good time. And if it was green, it gave me energy and I felt excited and I wanted to keep working on that.

(00:18:17):
And when I looked back at the last few weeks, it was almost all red and yellow. And I was like, okay, this is really from an energy standpoint, I don't think I love this. And so I would say think about the work that you're doing and that lens. Get really good at figuring out what are the things that you love most about being a product person, and how can you optimize your next role for those things that you love?

(00:18:39):
We should talk a little bit more about this, but each company has a very different product org. And the day to day of your job as a product manager, depending on where you go in the product that you're building, is very different. And so really thinking through what that work looks like, what their process is, who your end consumer is, what will the actual work you be doing every day, what will that be? And if you can get really clear on that, and then get clear on what gives you energy and what you love, it makes it a lot easier to figure out where you should go next.

Lenny (00:19:04):
Wow. I love that tactic. I've never heard of that. Just going back to the meetings that you have in measuring, just reflecting on how much energy that meeting gave you. Great tip. Thank you for sharing that. And I'll also double down on Shopify is an amazing place to work. Just to make that clear. It's probably one of the few places I recommend PMs go try to work at.

Nickey Skarstad (00:19:23):
Yeah. I think especially if you're newer in your PM career, they just have a really great organization. And I think it's a great place to learn how to PM. Also their product, it's a huge scaled product. And so it's complicated to build in. So I think it's a great place to really understand second order systems and systems thinking. And especially if that type of work gives you energy, I would recommend that people look for jobs there. But again, get really good at what you love. And I think what I've realized longer term is I really like the zero to one early stage. How do we get product market fit? And how do we really think through the early experience? And Shopify is at a very different stage than that. They're doing that in a couple places for sure, but that's not their day to day. And so that was interesting.

Lenny (00:20:06):
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Going back to what you just touched on, the idea of product org and structure and how different companies build product, there's kind of two ways to approach this and take whichever direction you want. Which of the companies you've worked at did you enjoy most, and that's kind of stuck with you as a way you want to build product? Or just like, how would you approach building a product org in cross-functional teams versus not, and reporting lines, things like that? What do you recommend there?

Nickey Skarstad (00:20:34):
Yeah. So I feel like you're asking me to pick a favorite child, which especially as a mother, that's hard to do. But no, I don't know. I feel like I've learned things from a lot of these different places and it's hard to choose. I think some of my early work at Etsy was very formative, and it was where I learned how to be a product manager. And so I feel very proud of that. I also think Etsy was out there building in public. I'm literally doing air quotes right now. I know you can't see me.

Lenny (00:20:57):
I can see them.

Nickey Skarstad (00:20:58):
But they were doing that because they had such a passionate, involved, engaged early community that they could not just ship things and have them land well if they did not involve their community early. So they were doing prototyping, beta testing, and basically getting people to try things and give feedback on things. I honestly, I think before a lot of people were, and that was something at the time that was really interesting and has really stayed with me, it's how to work with community and how to build community around the product that you're building.

(00:21:25):
Because at the end of the day, especially when it's early days, it really helps scale, get people to evangelize what you're building, help teach other people how to use it, things like that. And so I learned how to do that at Etsy. And I think that was super formative. And then also just Airbnb, what we talked about before, and just deeply baking in product quality and the end consumer experience into everything that you're building is also something I literally apply every day. So if I had to choose, it would be those two places, but I plan on continuing to learn.

Lenny (00:21:54):
Interesting. Both very community driven businesses.

Nickey Skarstad (00:21:57):
True.

Lenny (00:21:58):
And then in terms of how they structured their org, is there anything there about just here's what I've learned works best for how to build product teams, structure product teams, that stuck with you?

Nickey Skarstad (00:22:07):
Yeah. So I think there's kind of two overarching popular organizational modes for product org specifically. There's either the functional organization where everyone in the product team will report up through either a VP product, or a chief product officer, or something along those lines. And I think that actually really works in certain circumstances and is great. And typically how that works is you'll have your product partners, your trifecta, if you will, you have your design partner and your engineering partner, they will typically also report up into functional leadership. I think in bigger organizations that really works well, especially when you have orgs that need a lot of development in the function. So you'll have a lot of either APMs or product managers who are newer in their career and need a lot of support in development. And I think those functional ways of building makes sense. When I was at Etsy, that was the way that the reporting structure was and it made a lot of sense.

(00:23:00):
And then on the flip side, actually, when I was at Airbnb, because experiences was this new pretty nascent business opportunity, it had a GM structure. And so basically the whole product org that worked on experiences laddered up into a business leader and that business leader managed all of the functions. So they were the manager of the operations team, the marketing folks, product, and whatever. And I actually think that really worked for team like experiences at a company like Airbnb because what it did is it gave the leader of that business a ton of autonomy to really figure out what does this business need to be successful? And they didn't have to rely on, I guess they did in some ways, but not 100% rely on the larger company's resources to get the work that they needed done.

(00:23:44):
And I actually think that had they launched experiences inside of the Etsy style of organizational structure, it never would've succeeded because it had such a unique business need, and it needed its own process and ways of building product, et cetera. And because they sort of, hate to say wall it off, because it wasn't fully walled off, but because they gave it its own space and its own structure, it allowed it to succeed because they were able to fund it in the right way, give it the resources that it needed, et cetera.

(00:24:14):
So I've seen those two types of models work. And I think if I was a founder and I was building my initial product org, how I would think about it was basically what are we trying to build? What is the product? And then what type of process do we need to put in place for us to figure out how do we build it? And then what type of people do we need? And then really taking a step back to really figure out, all right, organizationally, how do we shape this so we can make sure that those people have autonomy and they have what they need to just be able to cruise? So I honestly don't think there's a right way. I know that's a non-answer. I think it really depends on what you're trying to build and the stage at which you're at.

Lenny (00:24:48):
Is there a default approach you'd suggest, just like most often you should go to the GM model, or most often you should just go with this cross-functional team?

Nickey Skarstad (00:24:58):
Yeah. I mean, I think especially if your business is new, going functional makes sense because you don't necessarily have a lot of organizational complexity. Airbnb at the time we were there, Lenny, was a huge company, right? It had tons of different teams that were trying to tackle many different problems. So that GM model made a lot of sense because it again was able to take a specific business opportunity, give it the resources that it need, and give it space to run. When your company's smaller stage, I think that matters less. Typically, especially if you're working on solving similar problems as an organization, functional makes a ton of sense. Because then you're also thinking more holistically about, all right, how do we build the right product development process across different functions to make sure that we are, to use a bad metaphor, it's like the symphony metaphor. You have all these different instruments that need to figure out how do we play together at the right times? And I think that functional way of working actually allows you to do that really well.

Lenny (00:25:52):
This episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify, and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList's head of product, "Banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack." Embedding banking into your product, not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain and monetize your customers.

(00:26:21):
Unit is the market leader in banking as a service, combining multiple bank partners with a developer friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks. Unit is trusted by leading brands, such as AngelList, ID, Invoice2go, and Roofstock. To hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.

(00:26:54):
Something I learned at Airbnb and from many other companies at this point is there's never going to be the one right way to structure, and companies bounce back and forth between them. Like Airbnb, for example, has moved from GM model to functional reporting lines back to GM. And so things change and you try some, see how it goes, adjust, optimize for the biggest opportunity. And then you'll probably change it six months later.

(00:27:18):
I asked a few people that know you and that worked with you questions that they think I should ask you. And one of the questions that came up most often is around how you set vision, translate that into goals, and then execute on those goals. And I know that's something a lot of PMs want to get better at and something that a lot of PMs aren't great at. And so can you just share any thoughts, advice, stories around that and how you do that well?

Nickey Skarstad (00:27:43):
Yeah. Well one, I want to know who you talked to. That's terrifying. Hopefully they said good things. You don't have to out them.

Lenny (00:27:49):
Unnamed sources. Unnamed sources.

Nickey Skarstad (00:27:51):
Yes. Well I'm glad to hear that because that actually is some of the work that I honestly love the most. And when I look at my calendar, those are moments where I am green energy. And so I have some first principles that I like to apply when I'm thinking about setting high level vision and strategy. And the first is make sure that you pull in your people and your team. I've seen a lot of director level people through my career who will try to work on strategy in a vacuum alone. They'll write a document and they'll be like, "Okay, team. Here's what we're doing. Here's our strategy." And it never goes well. And it doesn't go well. It might be the right strategy, but because you did not bring people along on that journey to come up with it, they did not feel like they had a hand in crafting it themselves. They are often not bought in, and getting people to buy in when they haven't been involved is very challenging and time consuming. We don't got time, right?

(00:28:40):
And so I think that's my first principle is just bring along the team. And I think there are ways to do that where you're not voting on strategy. You should not be voting. I think good product work is often not democratic, right? You need a clear leader who understands a lot of the signals and understands the larger competitive marketplace that can make decisions. And I think, especially when you're thinking about strategy, it's great to get input, but ultimately at the end of the day, you should have one person who is responsible for it.

(00:29:06):
And the other thing is a lot of times people don't really talk to leadership or the larger business leaders to get organizational context that helps them come up with the right strategy. They'll sort of build something in a vacuum, and then they'll come up with it and they'll get a ton of feedback from people across the org that were like, "Oh, this conflates with our strategy. We're doing this, and it's very similar." Or, "Our structural platform actually does not have the capability for us to do that thing." Whatever. And so just make sure that you're talking to people. And also all the way up to the CEO, and making sure the founder and the CEO is very bought in because ultimately, at the end of the day, they're choosing to resource what you're working on and are going to help you meet what you need. So those are some of the foundations for good vision and strategy work.

(00:29:51):
And then kind of zooming down into the weeds, I really like the vision mission strategy pyramid. I think might be a little tired. I like to think it's wired. But yeah. So if you just think about a pyramid shape, at the top is vision. Below it is mission and strategy, and then objectives. And this is a very simple framework. You honestly just Google vision mission strategy objectives, and you'll see it in Google image results. And all it is really is thinking about hitting those specific notes and thinking about them top down. So where do you need to go long term? What is the long term vision of what you're trying to do? In 10 years, if you could zoom up and look at what an ideal path for you would be, what is that? Write it down.

(00:30:32):
And then you start, as you go down the pyramid, you get clearer and basically you bring things down to your moment in time more clearly. So if you're thinking about your mission, all right, it's another level of abstraction of how do we make our vision come to life. And then you get into strategy. All right, how do we actually pick apart what we think is going to need to happen for us to actually be able to execute on that vision? And then your objectives can be OKRs, or whatever sort of goal setting model that you use to really one level get clear on, all right, in the next three to six months, what are the actual notes that we need to hit to be able to sing that beautiful symphony, is a terrible metaphor. And now I'm open to say it. But whatever.

Lenny (00:30:32):
I get it. I get it.

Nickey Skarstad (00:31:15):
Dang it. Love a bad metaphor.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's evocative. While we're on that topic, actually just to interrupt briefly, how are you very practically doing this for say vision and mission? Are you starting a Google doc and writing it out, are you using Miro or FigJam, or something like that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:31:30):
Yeah, so I think visioning exercise is a great moment to pull in your larger team. Because I'm remote now, I would use Miro or FigJam. Duolingo, we use FigJam typically because we are super embedded in Figma. In the past I've used MURAL. I actually personally like MURAL's whiteboarding product better. So I would open that up and I would walk through a number of things with the team and do a brainstorm literally. All right. Where do you all see us going in 10 years? What do we think what is the larger competitive landscape going to do in the next 10 years that could need to influence the work that we're doing? What are their ideas, and get everyone thinking.

(00:32:05):
Good brainstorm are often cross-functional. So go outside of your own team. Can you pull in somebody from marketing? Can somebody from the larger policy team sit in? How do you make it really cross-functional and really zoom up and give everyone the space and the freedom to think existential and to frame it that way,?we are going to be thinking in a five to 10 year timeline. Do not worry about what's happening today. And honestly, if you do that right, those are super fun exercises.

Lenny (00:32:30):
And you're doing this remotely, I imagine.

Nickey Skarstad (00:32:32):
Yep.

Lenny (00:32:33):
And so do you just kind of schedule a meeting, kick it off, point everyone to this Miro doc, for example, with a bunch of prompts and sticky notes and things like that? How do you actually practically do that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:32:44):
So I would pre-fill out the Miro beforehand. So figure out what are the things you want to discuss with your team, create them as headers in the Miro document. So when everyone lands in there, you have a very clear here's what we're talking about today. You can put that into the agenda on your calendar invite. I've actually been to some really good strategic brainstorms that will attach some kind of competitive thinking landscape in advance. So people could have a little bit of a pre-read.

(00:33:06):
And then when you get into the actual session, you already have the time allotments scheduled and thought through. And both Miro and FigJam have really awesome timer, and it'll play music while everyone is working. It's pretty cute. FigJam's sounds are really well done. Whoever their sound architect is, bravo. And it'll ding after, give them 10 minutes and it'll give you a nice chime, and then you can review them together and you can go through each touchpoint that you want to talk about.

(00:33:33):
After it's done, I like to do some synthesis together in the meeting. So basically grab ideas that are similar, bucket things into concepts that are alike. And then I will take it later and spend more time thinking about it. I think a lot of people think you have to actually come away with a vision together in a meeting that's very clear, and you don't. You can just come up with ideas, take a stab at drafting it, and get some more feedback before it's final.

Lenny (00:33:56):
One last question on this thread, which also could be an entire hour of discussion, are there any examples of prompts or things you ideated that you could share? I know you can't talk about what you're doing at Duolingo, but just to make it a little more concrete for people, what are some examples of things that you brainstormed?

Nickey Skarstad (00:34:11):
Yeah. I mean, so to take it back to experiences, because we've talked about that a lot, so people have some baseline context. Some of the early experiences visioning was really interesting because it was all about what type of experience can we create. And really thinking through when you've traveled in the past, what has brought you joy? Or what were the moments in your travel journey that have been really interesting, provocative, basically you remember the most, and why? And thinking through some of those things as a group. And those are good group exercises, because you're like, wow, I got to know a lot about Lenny by that crazy travel experience that he had. And so really kind of thinking through about how you craft really meaningful prompts that, again, connect to your strategy. So how does that ladder up into strategy? Obviously thinking through the experience that you're creating is going to help you come up with the right vision and fill out your pyramid in the right way, right?

Lenny (00:34:57):
Okay. So we went on kind of on a tangent around brainstorming. Did you want to share more around just going from vision to goals to execution?

Nickey Skarstad (00:35:04):
Yeah. So I think just generally, as you walk down that strategy pyramid, really getting down into the OKRs. And I think it's important because sometimes strategy is too abstract and too high level. And it's hard for people to take the step on how do I walk up that pyramid? And that to me is where having good strategy and having good OKRs help your team do that. And so good OKRs to me are just clear articulations of your strategy, whatever it is that are important to you, and it boils it down into the next three months, here's what we're working on. And I think that is just really good for teams because, again, if you're always in the clouds, it starts to get hard to really bring things down to the feature level of we're going to create a Jira ticket for this specific thing that we need to build. It needs to connect up to a strategy and back down.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Got it. Where do you put, say, these OKRs? Do you just brainstorm, come up with vision and rough strategy, that translates into goals? Where do you do this? And then also just how long do you usually spend on this overall process?

Nickey Skarstad (00:36:06):
Yeah. So the way that we do it at Duolingo now is we work on quarterly OKRs. And so that process will kick off usually the third month in the quarter. Really thinking through, all right, how are we trending on our OKRs this quarter? Did we commit to the right number of things? How are we doing? And then it is going, all right, so what do we need to do next quarter? And ideally, again, that's going to plug into a longer term plan. Otherwise it feels a little messy, and it feels not grounded in a long term plan or strategy in any way, shape, or form.

(00:36:36):
And then, so what we'll do is spend a few weeks as a team coming up with, all right, what could the next quarter look like? What is going to add the most impact and help us execute on that long term strategy? And then how do we make sure that we're setting the right objectives and KRs below them? And then usually there's some sort of leadership review. I actually forget, Lenny, how did goal setting go at Airbnb? I honestly don't remember. It sounds terrible, but it was a while ago. I can't even remember if Airbnb used OKRs.

Lenny (00:37:03):
There was a long period where OKRs were a very big deal. Our head of product was really gungho on OKRs. And I think for a couple years, we were very strict OKR culture. And then it kind of evolved into just rough-

Nickey Skarstad (00:37:15):
Goals.

Lenny (00:37:16):
... interpretation of OKRs. Yeah, goals and strategy and mission and vision. And so it's kind of this morphed version at this point, as far as I know.

Nickey Skarstad (00:37:23):
Gotcha. Yeah. And I will say OKR frameworks might not be the best for every single team, but having some sort of goal framework that is shared across functions is useful no matter the size or the scale of your business. I think a lot of times people get hung up and they want to nitpick OKRs specifically. And I think some of those criticisms are very fair. But you should have some sort of framework that's shared from a process standpoint across your team that everyone can use and work on together. Because again, it takes your strategy and it brings it down into the now. So you can act on, in the next three months, you can bring something to life, and you're very clear on what that looks like.

Lenny (00:37:57):
I'm going to pull out a thread of something you mentioned earlier of how to finally make decisions. And how in your experience the PM kind of is often sort of a final decision maker. I'd love to hear any advice you have of how to set that up on a team where it's either clear the PMs have a little bit more say and/or just bring people along to a final conclusion. Is there any advice on tips and tactics used to help with that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:38:22):
Yeah. So I actually just read this really great book that is slightly tangential, but I thought it really applied to this type of basically getting people to align on decisions. It's by Chris Voss. He is this famous FBI negotiator. I think it's called Split the Difference: Negotiating As if Your Life Depends on It. Don't quote me on that.

Lenny (00:38:38):
I think it's Never Split the Difference, right? And then I think he's also got a masterclass which I've watched, which is really good.

Nickey Skarstad (00:38:43):
I actually haven't watched the masterclass yet, but it's on my list after reading the book. And a lot of it, I think, especially because he's an FBI person, I thought it was going to be very much, "You're going to do this." And it's all basically his whole approach is empathy, and it's repeating things back to you, making people feel heard, making sure that you're hearing why they maybe don't like your strategy, or why they think that's a bad OKR. And I think if you can spend some time just listening to your team and really understanding why is this not resonating, you can help guide people on the right path. Or you realize you're wrong. Good PMs are humble people, right? You're not always right. Not always going to be right. So how do you know when you're right and wrong is another good podcast that you should do with somebody else cause I'm probably not very at it. Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:43):
Good tip. I really like that.

Nickey Skarstad (00:39:28):
Yeah. But I think that helps. And the other thing is I love the concept of one way versus two way door decision making, right? If your team is making a really critical long-term decision that's going to be limiting to a lot of the future things that you could want or need to do, that is a one way door decision. And you should spend time really thinking about discussing it, getting feedback and buy-in from your larger community, from your leadership team, et cetera. If it is a two-way door decision, it's not going to make a huge impact, you can change it later if you need to, let your team cruise on those things. Because it gives people autonomy. It helps you move fast. And then it just makes sure that when it does come down to decisions that are harder to change longer term, then those are the moments you should spend time and really think about and discuss and debate, et cetera.

Lenny (00:40:09):
Do you have any examples or stories that come to mind of those sorts of decisions that you kind of help people just go for it, even though I may not necessarily agree?

Nickey Skarstad (00:40:17):
Let's see. Yeah. So one big one that we made at Airbnb that was pretty formative in early days was we came up with basically an articulation of what we thought a good experience was, and the standards that an experience needed to meet for it to be considered a good experience for us. And that was a many month long term project. And it was so important because we ended up building the product around it, building our policies around it, building how we educated our hosts around it. We had one moment in time to figure it out and get it right until it scaled everywhere. And so that was a true one way door decision where it was really hard to change later because we literally needed it to be relatively final.

(00:40:53):
On Etsy, there was some big decisions that were made at certain points in time around what can be sold in the marketplace, and how to think through what constitutes something that is hand made. Those were one way door decisions, right? It's really hard to change that later because it's going to influence all of the listings that you have in your ecosystem. And so I think really thinking through those types of things are important and really setting teams up to be able to pause and spend some time to get it right because it will influence the end product in a very real way.

Lenny (00:41:23):
How do you know if it's a one way or a two way door decision? Do you find that it's generally pretty obvious when you're making the decision, or is it sometimes like, oh shit, we should have thought about that more?

Nickey Skarstad (00:41:34):
Yeah. I would say I think I'm good at this 80% of the time these days, just because I've seen it done wrong in a lot of ways. But I think it's a muscle that you build honestly, and you get better over time about thinking about second order thinking. And so it's starting to understand, all right, if I make this decision today, it's going to impact this next level of decisions and the next level after that. And that will cascade through our larger system.

(00:41:56):
A great book to read if you are a product person is Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows. It's just about really thinking through how systems work, and then you can start to extrapolate what is the second order effect of the system. And if you think about that through your own ecosystem, it starts to help you understand, all right, this is a linchpin in our larger ecosystem that we got to be really careful about if we're going to touch it or change it longer term. But I do think some of that it's muscle, you build it over time. You make a couple of mistakes sometimes, and then you have to realize the true consequences of those mistakes and you don't make it again.

Lenny (00:42:29):
Can we talk a bit more about the second order decision framework? I know you have a awesome newsletter post about this, and it was something I wanted to chat about. Is this a framework that PMs can use to make better decisions? And I guess how could they do that? And then maybe just describe a little bit more about just this concept of second order decisions, because it sounds really important.

Nickey Skarstad (00:42:50):
Yeah. Basically what second order thinking is is you being able to think beyond the decisions that you're making today. The decisions you make today will affect tomorrow's decisions and your ability to build on your decisions that you made today. And this feels very existential and meta, but why it's important is that, especially when you're building product, is there's a cost associated with your time of everything you build. Especially when you're building marketplaces or anything with UGC content. When you make a change today, and it impacts every single user in your ecosystem that then is going to act on that change, it's really hard to make those changes later.

(00:43:23):
Let's talk about Airbnb home listing as an example. Really thinking through what are the pieces of data or all the pieces of data in the system that we need to actually list a home. And then how do we use those throughout our whole system in different ways? And then anytime you have to change those things. So that could be little simple things like truncating the length of the title of an Airbnb home when it's listed on the platform. You're going to have mad hosts, you're going to have design changes that need to be made to make sure that they can actually display something in a different way. It gets just inherently more complex the more complex your system is. So that is probably a terribly described way of describing second order thinking.

Lenny (00:44:01):
That makes total sense. And that's something we dealt with it, sorry to interrupt, but that's like on the host team, we dealt with this question often of just any change you make and the listing flow is going to impact so much of the experience of a host and a guest. And so that makes total sense. Sorry, keep going.

Nickey Skarstad (00:44:16):
Yeah. No, and I think that forcing yourself and your team to think in that way is just a really good thinking exercise because it will save you time and it will save you money, a lot of money later, if you don't constantly have to rebuild things when you want to make changes to your system later. And that ladders up again into having a very clear vision and a strategy. Because what you're doing is you're starting to think on the long horizon. And so the decisions that you're making today are in service of that long horizon. So you can actually build in that direction and you don't constantly have to rebuild every time you're trying to change something.

Lenny (00:44:50):
On the second order thinking, sorry, I called it second order decision, but in this framework that you spoke of, how do you actually operationalize this concept? When you're planning, do you write out in the document second order impact that we should be thinking about, or do you do something else?

Nickey Skarstad (00:45:05):
Yeah. So I think there's many ways to do this. If you have a spec-ed template or a piece of documentation that your team typically use when they're writing out product strategy or product requirements, et cetera, you can put a line in here to force people to think about it. I also think thinking about first principles and writing out first principles for the changes that you're making often are in service of second order thinking. Where it's like here are the things that we care about. Here's why these things are important. And we want to make sure these are baked into what we're building. Typically you'll write those through the lens of second order thinking.

(00:45:36):
Shopify uses first principles a lot in everything that they build. And this is something I took away from that way of working because it's extremely effective. If you can get teams to align on first principles early on, it saves you a lot of heartache later because you've got people to align way early days before you even got into the design process, or before you had to start thinking about how do we actually technically implement this.

(00:45:56):
And then the other way I would say is there's ways to structure or have thoughtful discussion around second order effects. That could be a brainstorm. You could use Miro to think about that. We're going to make these changes today. How do they cascade through our ecosystem? What are the gotchas or the things we need to worry about? And again, I think the more complex your ecosystem is, the more you are forced to do this. A lot of founders in early stage products don't think like this because they're so focused on the product market fit. We need to just get something that people are using. That then when they get product market fit, they realize when they get into scale mode, they didn't build something scalable, and they have to rebuild things which can actually really hurt them when they're trying to grow really quickly later on.

Lenny (00:46:35):
Yeah. Absolutely. Happens all the time. For principles, do you put those in to say the team strategy, like the quarterly strategy document? Like here's our principles for the quarter? Is that how you generally do that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:46:47):
Yeah. I think that is a great place to put it. You can write them on the feature level too. So something that you're building, just getting clearer on here are the things that matter to us. Here's what we care about. We're going to design in service of these things. And here are the things that aren't that important. And again, those are the types of places in a product requirements doc where people will argue the most, which is a good thing because you're basically discussing and debating sort of foundations of what you're going to build before you get into the work of building it. And so those exercises are always a good idea.

Lenny (00:47:16):
Awesome. I love that. Okay. So going back, because I wanted to close this thread, you've come up with your vision, your mission, your strategy, your goals as a team. People start to align around it. What do you do to kick it off and get people on board and aware of the plan, and then to stay on plan with that strategy and not kind of be distracted by new priorities and shiny objects?

Nickey Skarstad (00:47:38):
Yes. Oh, the shiny object thing is very real. Good question. So for example, I just did this recently where I brought my team along through the OKR process for Q2 planning. They had a say in basically what we decided we were going to work on. It went up for leadership approval. We got approval. And my process was I used Loom, which is another one of my favorite products. It's just a really easy screen share and video recording tool that you can share with teams. And so I just recapped, "All right, here's what I presented to leadership. Here are the feedback that we got. Here's the strategic feedback that we got. And here are the changes we're going to make. Any questions, let me know." And I posted it in Slack.

(00:48:10):
So I was just trying to keep the feedback loop really quick and tight with teams rather than wait till the next meeting you have with them a week later. I was like, all right, I'm going to just try to spend five minutes recording this and get it out ASAP. And that helps because then it gets people excited. Okay, cool. This thing that I worked on got really great feedback from leadership, and now we're working on it. I'm excited to get going.

(00:48:29):
And then it depends. Usually depending on the project, I have some sort of kickoff. I don't usually do a quarterly kickoff or anything like that because I think there's usually disparate teams owning different parts of strategy. But usually having a good weekly team meeting where you're really thoughtful about cascading feedback down from leadership, constantly checking in on what are we trying to do here? What is our strategy? How are these goals that we set laddering up? Are we achieving it? Are we not? Whatever. Having a meeting like that where you're kind of constantly talking about it each week also helps people feel bought in and not get distracted.

(00:48:59):
And actually I found that teams who are very bought to your vision and strategy are less distractable. Where I usually have more trouble is with leadership that aren't necessarily in the weeds with your team every day. And I'll get an idea. "Have you thought about doing this one random obscure thing?" "Yes. However, it's not in service of this long term plan, so we don't want to do that right now because we don't think it's the best use of our time."

Lenny (00:49:23):
Got it. And the way you're describing it, this is as a manager of product managers-

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:27):
Yep.

Lenny (00:49:28):
... versus an ICPM? Cool. So as an ICPM, I imagine you would do a quarterly kickoff, or whatever your cycle length. You kick off with the team. Here's what we're doing. Any questions?

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:38):
Totally.

Lenny (00:49:40):
Okay. Another thing I wanted to make sure we have time to chat about is product review meetings and process. Just kind of like how do you, as a product leader, make sure that you're shipping great stuff that you're proud of and that your leaders aren't surprised by? How do you design just a product review and design process.

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:56):
Yeah. So I have a lot of strong feelings on product reviews. And it's because I've been in a lot of different organizations and I've seen a lot of bad ways of doing this honestly. And I think it also depends on the product that you're building and the team that you've created. So I don't think that there's one right or wrong way to do this.

(00:50:12):
Where I've seen them fail is when they happen at the function level, and they're not done or shared as a team. Typically it's normal to have a design review or to have some sort of technical review. And the more you can try to bring those different review processes into one central moment to check in, the better it tends to go. Because what happens is you'll have feedback in a vacuum. The design leader will give the designer feedback, and then you don't hear about it. Or there'll be some technical flaw that happens in a very specific technical review that doesn't get back to the larger team.

(00:50:43):
So finding ways to make sure that those parts of your process are shared across each function, and you attend them and prepare for them as a team, I think really helps a lot of that. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a design review. Of course you should. I mean, you should just be really thoughtful about having moments, especially if there are moments where you're blessing something to move forward, to making sure the whole team is there. And that there's a very strategic check-in process to get those things approved that everyone knows about and is a part of.

Lenny (00:51:11):
Is that a meeting that you do weekly and you invite the designer and the engineer? Who do you invite, I guess, and what is the goal of that meeting? The goal of that meeting, I imagine, is approved the product to go launch and build.

Nickey Skarstad (00:51:23):
Yeah. And I think especially going back to the one way, two way door moment, giving teams autonomy to ship some things that you think are two way doors and aren't necessarily mission critical are important to your vision, but aren't going to conflate with the larger system, I think trying to keep things quick and not have too many barriers for people to ship is incredibly important. So you'll have to figure that out for your own org and it's nuances, but that is something that is important.

(00:51:49):
But when there are moments where you think it is basically a feedback gate, where it's a gate you need to walk through and a specific moment in time where you've gotten feedback, I think having a cross-functional meeting where there's a clear pre-read or something that's sent before. It's like, here's what we're talking about today. And then aligning on, do we think this meets our goals and does this meet our quality bar? And doing that in a really thoughtful way just so the team gets feedback. So the leadership is plugged in, but also so you're not standing the way of people shipping their products.

Lenny (00:52:17):
And then do you check in throughout the process of the product being built, or do you kind of encourage teams to get to a point where it's basically ready for approval?

Nickey Skarstad (00:52:26):
Yeah. Ideally in a perfect world, there's three check-in moments. There is the first principles check-in. What are you trying to build, or what are you trying to do? What are the sort of foundations that you're going to build on? What is the most important thing? What are you solving for? Getting approval on that, weirdly, is almost the most important thing. Because it saves a lot of teams a lot of time when they get later in their feedback review process and people are like, "You're not solving for the right thing." So that's important.

(00:52:49):
Once you've aligned on that, then it's like, all right, what approach are we going to use? What are we going to build? And that's sort of how we solve the problem. Making sure that there is a technical component there too so there's some sort of infrastructure review or architecture review, or whatever you want to call it. And then it's like, all right, this is ready to ship. Let's check in again. Do we think it's ready? And I think that, again, it depends on your organization. If you have a very small team, you might be very plugged in and these things might not need to happen. But in bigger organizations, especially where leadership isn't always able to be in the room, making sure that you have a clear checking in a few times to make sure that everyone is moving in the right direction and everyone feels good is, I think, a worthwhile exercise.

Lenny (00:53:27):
I love that. Such a simple framework. And then one last question along those lines, do you leave it up to the team to schedule these meetings, or are you pulling it out of them and making sure they schedule it?

Nickey Skarstad (00:53:36):
Today, because the team that I'm working on is pretty small, and we're pretty pre-product market fit, we're not doing a ton of very formal check-in moments because we don't need to be. Because it's a small team and we're all cruising together. But in bigger orgs that I've worked in, for Shopify, for example, there was a process around having these meetings and who would be there. And so those would kind of be scheduled through the larger processor system that they were working in, which really worked for them actually. And I think it allowed teams to be pretty autonomous on the day to day, but just making sure that there was feedback coming of from their users as well as from leadership.

Lenny (00:54:08):
Got it. One last question before we get to our exciting lightning round. And it's something that I've been thinking a lot about recently, which is around remote work as a product manager. I left Airbnb before COVID, and so I never lived in this world of everything is remote and product managing remotely. Is there anything you've picked up or learned that has been really helpful to being a product leader in a remote world?

Nickey Skarstad (00:54:30):
Yeah. I would say last couple years have just been a huge shift in my ways of working. I sort of grew up as a PM in IRL environments where we did the majority of our work together in the same room. So that was whiteboarding, having a quick sync after you had an in person meeting to finalize some details or keep hashing out a problem. It's so cheesy and overhyped, but the proverbial water cooler moment where you see somebody, and you're like, "Hey, how are you doing, Hey, did you hear about this thing?" All of those things literally went away overnight.

(00:55:01):
And I think especially the job of a PM, it's hard under normal times because you are doing so much labor to make sure people are informed and give feedback, et cetera. And then overnight you took away a lot of the methods that they were using to do it. And so I think that has been a pretty profound shift for a lot of people working in product roles.

(00:55:21):
The good news is there's a ton of new tools and new technology that's actually being built right now that's majorly helpful for this. So I use Slack in very new ways today than I did two years ago. Things like just making sure to post more asynchronous updates. Trying to actually take the burden off of an IRL or a Zoom meeting. Can we talk about this asynchronously and do it in Slack? Slack has this really great feature called huddles where you can just quickly get on. It's just audio. So there's no video. And you can just have a 30 second conversation. It's good for standups and things like that. Suggest you try it if you haven't yet.

(00:55:56):
And then a lot of the old in person whiteboarding, things like that, you can do those now using awesome tools like Miro and FigJam. And I feel like, especially at Airbnb, we had such an international team that there was always somebody who was remote typically. And I think we never really got the remote experience right. And now that the majority of our teams are remote, I'm a fully remote person, I've been a lot more thoughtful about making sure we're creating a really good experience of how we're working for the larger team. And so I think you have to hack on this with your team. Different teams have different ways of working, but trying to be a synchronous, using Slack, making sure you're following up in very visible ways where people can see. Don't rely on Zoom meetings to fill all of your time. Otherwise people will literally hate you. And things like that really make a huge difference.

Lenny (00:56:43):
Awesome. Super helpful. All right. Nickey, are you ready for the lightning round?

Nickey Skarstad (00:56:48):
I'm ready. Let's do this.

Lenny (00:56:49):
What's a book that you recommend most to other product managers?

Nickey Skarstad (00:56:53):
I love Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows.

Lenny (00:56:57):
Awesome. Okay. We're going to link to that in the description. Other than Duolingo, what's another company that you recommend the PMs go work at or explore when they're looking for a new gig?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:07):
Yeah, I would say Etsy hands down.

Lenny (00:57:09):
And why is that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:10):
I think it's a great place to learn how to be a PM. Data driven, really supportive, product leadership, and a super fun product to build.

Lenny (00:57:18):
Awesome. Love that. What's the current favorite kind of app or piece of software that helps you do your work better?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:25):
I'm obsessed with Superhuman, which is a email productivity app, which once you start using it, you can't not use it. You basically have to use it for the rest of your days. I also am obsessed with Loom, which is a video recording tool that makes it really easy to share really quick video updates.

Lenny (00:57:41):
Awesome, great choices. And then outside of work, what's a current favorite app or just piece of software that you love?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:47):
Definitely TikTok. Short form video is very fun and entertaining. Can't get enough of it, and have been creating some myself. So I'm definitely hooked.

Lenny (00:57:56):
While we're on that topic, how do people find you on TikTok?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:58):
Yeah, it's just my name. It's Nickey Skarstad, and give me a follow.

Lenny (00:58:03):
I'm a very happy follower. And then I'll link to that in description too. Who's a favorite person that you like to follow on either Twitter, or Instagram, or even TikTok?

Nickey Skarstad (00:58:12):
Yeah, so I love, she is a cultural journalist, her name is Anne Helen Petersen. And she's really plugged into sort of the larger cultural zeitgeist of the time. And I always give people, when people ask me my top advice for new PMs, it's just to be a consumer. To download new products, to try them out, to use all the things and try them because I think it actually makes you a better product builder. And follow people that are not just tech people on Twitter. You are doing yourself a disservice if your entire feed is tech people. So find people that are plugged into cultural zeitgeist because it helps you also understand the moment in which you are shipping, and it'll make sure that you're acing your product marketing and your messaging and you're building the right thing.

Lenny (00:58:53):
What's her name again?

Nickey Skarstad (00:58:54):
Her name is Anne Helen Petersen.

Lenny (00:58:56):
Anne Helen Petersen. Love it. Okay. And then final question. Who's been your favorite manager?

Nickey Skarstad (00:59:01):
Yeah, so I couldn't pick one person here, so don't be mad. But it's actually a lot of women that I worked for at Etsy. The majority of my entire reporting line the time that I was there was all women, which has never happened to me again. So shout out to Kruti Patel, who is their current chief product officer, a woman named Heather Jassy, who ran the community team at Etsy long ago, who was a true delight to work for. And then Linda Findley, who is now the CEO of Blue Apron, but she was the chief operating officer at my time at Etsy. And she was my boss for a bit. And she was wonderful.

Lenny (00:59:31):
Amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. And thank you so much for joining me, Nickey, for doing this. Where can people find you online? And then just generally, how can people that are listening to this be helpful to you?

Nickey Skarstad (00:59:43):
Yeah, so I have newly become obsessed with TikTok, like I said before. I've been creating some fun, little short form videos. One of my regrets as a long time product builder is it's very time consuming to write down the stories of building products and to share them. But I found TikTok actually really easy to do that. So I'm going to try to experiment there a little bit more.

(01:00:01):
So you can follow me, I'm @NickeySkarstad on TikTok. And then I have a newsletter. I call it Builders. It's nickey.substack.com. Nickey is spelled like Mickey Mouse, but with an N. N-I-C-K-E-Y, .substack.com. And I publish their occasionally. I need to get it going again. But again, trying to write down more of the stories of actually being a builder who's been doing this for a long time. Because a lot of us don't have a lot of time to actually talk about it, but it's really interesting work and I want to share it more.

Lenny (01:00:29):
Awesome. I'm a follower and a subscriber to both. So highly recommend that.

Nickey Skarstad (01:00:29):
I love it.

Lenny (01:00:33):
And thank you so much, Nickey.

Nickey Skarstad (01:00:34):
Yeah. Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny (01:00:35):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# How to measure AI developer productivity in 2025 | Nicole Forsgren

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:03):
Most productivity metrics are a lie. If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever. It's just too easy to gain that system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
How do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can?

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:18):
Most teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
One of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is learning how much to trust code that it generates.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:32):
We can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it. Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
So much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:45):
There's some real opportunity there to not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work. Now, we can also make a 45-minute work block useful because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by, reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:01:09):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Nicole Forsgren. With so much talk about how AI is increasing developer productivity, more and more people are asking, "How do we measure this productivity gain? And are these AI tools actually helping us or hurting how our developers work?" Nicole has been at the forefront of this space longer than anyone. She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE. She wrote the most important book in the space called Accelerate and is about to publish her newest book called Frictionless, which gives you a guide to helping your team move faster and do more in this emerging AI world. Her core thesis is that AI indeed accelerates coding. But developers aren't speeding up as much as you think because they still have to deal with broken builds and unreliable tools and processes, and a bunch of new bottlenecks that are emerging.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we chat about her current, best and very specific advice for how to measure productivity gains from AI, signs that your team could be moving faster, what companies get wrong when trying to measure engineering productivity, how AI tools are both helping and hurting engineers, including getting into flow states, her seven-step process for setting up a developer experience team at your company, how to get buy-in and measure the impact of a team like this and a ton more. This episode is for anyone looking to improve the performance of their engineering teams.

Nicole, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:16):
Thank you. It's so good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
It's so good to have you back. I was just watching our first episode, which we did two and a half years ago. I was watching it, and I was both shocked and not shocked that we barely talked about AI. The episode was called How to Measure and Improve Developer Productivity, and we got to AI barely like an hour in and we're just like, "Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen with AI and productivity." Does that just blow your mind?

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:41):
Yeah. Because it was just hitting the scene, it was the topic of so much conversation, and at the same time, so many things don't change. So many things are still important, so many things are the same. Yeah. It's also a little wild that it's been two and a half. Where does time go? Time is a social construct?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:01):
Yeah. Most of our conversation was just questions like, "Well, how might this impact people? How will we change the way we build product?" It was barely a thing back then. Now, it's the only thing that I imagine people want to talk about when they talk about engineering productivity. That's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time focusing on today. The reason I'm excited about this conversation, it feels like there's been so much money poured into AI tools increasing productivity. The fastest growing companies in the world are these engineering AI tools. And now, more and more people are just asking this question of just, "What gains are we getting out of this? How much is this actually helping us be more productive? How do we become more productive?"

(00:06:39):
You've been at the center of this world for longer than anyone. You've invented so many of the frameworks that people rely on now. So I'm really excited to have you back to talk about this stuff. I want to start with just this term DevEx, it's something that comes up a lot in this whole space, and we're going to hear this term a bunch in this conversation. Can you just explain what is DevEx, this term DevEx?

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:00):
DevEx is developer experience. And when we think about developer experience, we're really talking about what it's like to build software, day to day, for a developer. So the friction that they face, the workflows that they have to go through, any support that they have. It's important because when DevEx is poor, everything else just isn't going to help. The best processes, the best tools, the best... whatever magic you have, if the DevEx is bad, everything kind of takes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):
Within DevEx is productivity, and I think the key insight that you had and other folks in the space of that is not just productivity, but there's also engineering happiness. We're going to get into a lot of these parts, but just maybe speak to... there's productivity and there's broader components to engineers being successful at a company.

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:51):
Yeah. I love that point because productivity, first of all, is hard to define anyway. But if you're just looking at output, you can get there in a lot of different ways. But if you're getting there in ways that are high toil or high friction, then at some point, a developer is going to burn out. Or if it's super high cognitive load, if it's hard to even think about what you're doing because concentrating on the mechanics of... the plumbing of something, then you don't have the brain space left to come up with really innovative solutions and questions. So I love that it's kind of this self-reinforcing loop in terms of, "You do more work, you do better work." And it's better for people, it's better for the systems, it's better for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:34):
I was going to get to this later, but I want to actually get to this right now, this idea of flow state for engineers. I was an engineer, actually, early in my career. I went to a school for computer science. I was an engineer for 10 years. The best part of the job for me was just this flow state you enter when you're coding and building, and just things feel like so fun. It feels like AI is making that harder in a lot of ways because there's all these agents you're working with now, there's all this code that's kind of being written for you. Talk about just the importance of flow state to a developer, happiness, developer productivity, and just what you've seen AI impacting. How you've seen AI impacting that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:09:07):
Well, there are lots of different ways to talk about DevEx. One way to talk about it is kind of three key things that have components that are important of themselves, and they also kind of reinforce each other. Flow state is one of them, cognitive load is another, and then feedback loops are another. I think when you touch on this... Your question about flow state is a really good one, and I'll admit we're just a few years into this. We're still figuring out what the best flow state and cognitive requirements are for people in this because, to your point, sometimes we're getting interrupted all the time. You don't just get in the flow and lock down, and write a whole bunch of code and do the typing of a whole bunch of code as much anymore. Instead, you're kind of creating a prompt, getting some code back and reviewing the code, trying to integrate what's happening in the system, and that can really interrupt.

(00:10:02):
At the same time though, it can contribute to flow if... I've seen some senior engineers pull together some tool chains that are really incredible, where they figured out how to keep the flow going. The fast feedback loops really, really work well for them. They can kind of assign out different pieces to agents. It helps them keep in the flow in terms of... Instead of details and line-by-line writing, they're in the flow in terms of, "What's my goal? What are the pieces that I need to get there? How quickly can I get there? So then, I can step back and kind of evaluate everything, and then dive back in and fix some pieces."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Is there anything more you could say about this engineer that figured out this really cool workflow, about just what that looks like?

Nicole Forsgren (00:10:39):
I've spoken with a handful of them, and I've kind of watched them work. I haven't built it myself yet. It's on my list. They've been able to set up this really incredible workspace and workflow where... Right now, a lot of us play around with tools and... We'll put in a prompt and we'll get a few lines back or maybe we'll put in a prompt and we'll get whole programs back. Well, what they can do is they can... Many times I'll see them say, to help prime it, "This is what I want to build. It needs to have these basic architectural components. It needs to have this kind of a stack. It needs to follow this general workflow. Help me think that through," and it'll kind of design it for it. And then for each piece, it'll assign an agent to go work on each pace in parallel, and then it'll say and upfront, "These need to be able to work together, make sure it's architected correctly. Make sure we use appropriate APIs and conventions."

(00:11:30):
Then at the end, they can let it run for a few minutes. They can think through something else that's interesting or they anticipate is going to be hairy, and they come back to something that's probably a little better than vibe coded. Because they were so systematic about it upfront, they're much closer to something that looks like production code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:51):
So what I'm hearing is spending a little time upfront planning, what all these AI engineers are doing, versus just powering through and just figuring out as you go.

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
Okay, cool. Let me get to this quite a core question that I think on is a lot of people's minds. A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams, "Is this improving our productivity? Is this hurting our productivity?" So let me just start with this question, how are people doing this wrong currently when they try to measure their productivity gains with AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:23):
I'll say most productivity metrics are a lie. It's really tricky because, historically... Now, look, lines of code has always been a bad metric, but many folks still use lines of code-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):
[inaudible 00:12:37].

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:37):
... yeah, as some proxy as some proxy for output or productivity or complexity or something. Well, now, for many of the systems, that they would sometimes whisper and not super talk about that uses lines of code, it's just blown out of the water because, "What do you mean by lines of code?" If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever and add tons of comments. We know that agents and LLMs tend to be very verbose by definition, and so it's just too easy to gain that system and then introduce complexity and technical debt into all of the work that you're doing. I will say there are some things that we can kind of watch and pay attention to because... So lines of code as a productivity metric isn't great, it's pretty bad. But now, it's kind of more relevant if we can tease out which code came from people and which code came from AI because now we can answer downstream questions.

(00:13:40):
"What is the code survivability rate? What is the quality of our code? Is our code being fed back into trained systems? And for that code that's retraining systems later, especially if we're doing fine-tuning and local tuning, how much of that is machine generated? What types of loops is that creating, and what types of patterns or biases might it be inadvertently introducing?" On the one hand, it's not good as a productivity metric, but it can be useful. I'll even say the same for DORA. I have done DORA metrics, their speed metrics, their stability metrics. If that's all you're looking at, it's not going to be sufficient anymore because AI has now changed the way we think about feedback loops. They need to be much faster. Now, what DORA's meant for, kind of assessing the pipeline overall in terms of speed and stability. Still, that works. But we can't just blindly apply the existing metrics we've used before because we'll miss super important phenomenon and changes in the way people work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:38):
Interesting. You invented DORA, that was kind of the main framework people used for a long time to measure productivity. And then there's SPACE, there's Core 4, there's probably others. So what I'm hearing here is all these are kind of out of date now, where AI is contributing large portions of code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:14:55):
I will say if it is a prescriptive metric, it needs to be used only in the way it was prescribed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:00):
So

Nicole Forsgren (00:15:01):
DORA 4, there are four key metrics. There's two speed metrics, deployment frequency and lead time. So code commit to code deploy. There's stability metrics, MTTR and change fail rate. If those are used to assess the speed of the pipeline and the general performance of the pipeline, that's great. If you're trying to use those to understand... Because implied in that is feedback loops, right, because you used to kind of get feedback from customers. But we can't just use that blindly now when we're using AI, as an example, because we have feedback loops much earlier and not even just at the local build and test phase. We have feedback loops throughout, and even sometimes in the middle of some of the pipeline, that we really want to leverage in ways that weren't as useful before. I won't say they weren't possible, but we just didn't really focus there.

(00:15:53):
So those are prescriptive metrics. When we think about SPACE, SPACE is a framework. It doesn't tell you what metric to use. So I'll say, sometimes people get real frustrated because I didn't tell them what to measure. But now, I think that's the power of it. We're actually seeing that SPACE applies fairly well in these new emerging contexts like AI because we still want to look at... SPACE is an acronym. We still want to look at satisfaction. We still want to look at performance, what's the outcome. We still want to look at activity. Yes, in some ways, lines of code and number of PRs can be useful for something, or number of alerts or number of things, activities or counts. Seize communication and collaboration, this is also super important and useful because it's how our systems communicate with each other, and also how our people do. "What proportion of work is being offloaded to a chat bot versus talking to a senior engineer on the team?" More isn't always better and less isn't always better, it depends.

(00:16:50):
And then efficiency and flow, "Can people get in the flow? How much time does it take to do things? What is the flow like through our system?" Here, I would probably add a couple of dimensions. So chatting with some of the early authors to say trust. Not to say trust wasn't important before, but now it's very, very front of mind. Right? Before you build your code, if the compile comes back, you're fine. And that's the way it is. LLMs are non-deterministic. Right now, we can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it, so, "Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write? And if it doesn't meet, is that fine?" So it depends on... Prescriptive. You got to make sure you're using it fit for purpose. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
We're going to get to your current thinking on the best way to do this stuff. You have a book coming out that explains how to do this well, so we're going to get to that. One thing I wanted to highlight in our last chat that we had, you highlighted that one of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is trust, understanding and learning how much to trust the code that it generates, and also how much... you said this, two and a half years ago, that so much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code. That's exactly what I'm hearing.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:10):
I think it'll be interesting to see how that impacts the way we structure work moving forward. We were talking about flow state and cognitive load. Now that our attention has to focus on things at certain times and it's broken up from how we used to do it, I think there's some real opportunity there to, not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:31):
Can you say more about that? Just what is that? What are you thinking will be happening? Where do you think things go? What are you seeing working?

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:37):
This is purely speculative. But for example, Gloria Mark has done some really good work on attention and deep work, and humans can get about four hours of good deep work a day. That's about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:52):
Yeah,. I feel that.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:54):
That's kind of the upper limit-ish for the most part, and I'm sure people are going to be like, "Well, I am superhuman and I can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
What if you take 20 grams of creatine?

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:01):
Right. What if we microdose?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Yeah, exact;y.

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:06):
Yeah. So in the context of knowing we have about four hours of good deep work... I'm sure many of us have probably hit this, right? We have good periods. Maybe it's morning, maybe it's afternoon for folks. And then you hit a time where you're like, "I'm going to clean up my inbox because that is all I can do right now. I can be functional, but I'm not going to come up with my best innovative, problem solving, authoring, code writing work." A lot of times, the way to do that and to get into it is to have these long chunks to get into flow and to get that deep work. Usually, I'm [inaudible 00:19:43] two hours-ish. An hour can be tricky because it could take time to get into that state. Okay. Well, when we think about what it used to be like, back in the old days, three years ago, three and a half years ago, we could block off four hours of time and we could probably get two or three hours of really good work done. Because we were just focused, right? There were no interruptions, minimal interruptions.

(00:20:05):
Now, the nature of writing code and systems itself is interrupt driven or full of interruptions, at least, because you start something and then it interjects. So how do we think about that? Does that mean that a four-hour word block is still useful? Probably. But does that mean that now we can also make a 45-minute work block useful? Because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system and all the things. So I think that's a really, really interesting area that's just ripe for questions and opportunity. And please, folks, do this research and come back to me because... It might not make my list, but it's such a great question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
That is so interesting. Essentially, every engineer is turning into an EM, engineering manager, coordinating all of these junior AI engineers. So your point is even if you have a 30-hour block, you can get deep into code, but you can unblock all these AI engineers that are running off doing tasks. Plus, your point is they remind you of just like, "Here's where you left off. Okay. You can just jump into this code, maybe make some tweaks."

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):
So interesting. Let me zoom out a little bit and... Before we get into your framework for how to approach developer experience, the latest thinking you've got, beyond just obviously engineers doing more is great, what's your best pitch for why companies should really, really focus on developer experience?

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:37):
I hate to say return of investment, but the business value is... the opportunity here is huge. In general, we write software for fun and for hobbies, but we also have software because it meets a business need. It helps us with market share, it helps us attract and retain customers, it helps us do all of these things. And I think DevEx is important because it enables all of that software creation, it enables all of that problem solving. It enables the super rapid experimentation with customers that... Before, you'd need a while for a prototype and maybe a little bit longer to actually flight it through an A/B test on a production system. You can do it in hours, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):
Maybe the opposite end of the spectrum, getting very tactical, before we get into the larger framework, what's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to help their developer experience maybe get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:22:35):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. I love that the audience of this podcast is primarily PMs because they tend to be really good at this. And I would say start with listening and not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, "Well, I'm just going to build this tool," or, "I'm going to build this thing." Often you build a thing that you yourself have had a challenge with or that is easy to do, easy to automate. And if you just go talk to people and ask the developers like, "Think of yesterday, what did you do yesterday? Walk me through it. What were the points that were just delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you get slowed down? Where was there friction?" If you go talk to a handful of people, a lot of times, you can surface a handful of things that are relatively low lift and still have impact or you can identify a process that's unnecessarily complex and slow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:36):
So the listening to, I hear, almost is you want to help your teams move faster and be happier eng teams. Your advice is just, "Before you do anything, just go ask them what is bothering you."

Nicole Forsgren (00:23:46):
Go ask them, yeah. And trust me, most developers are going to be more than happy to tell you what's broken and what's bad. I'll say, there was one company that I had worked with. I remember they had a process that was really difficult and it was on an old mainframe system, and they were going to have to replat the whole thing and so they never went to work on it or talk about it. Everyone hated it because it was this huge delay. I mean, all they had to do was change a process. Sometimes all you have to do is change a process. And they changed it so that instead of... I think someone had to print it out and walk it down three or four flights, and they get approval. And then someone else had to walk it back up, and so it was just that interim. They didn't replat anything. They didn't redesign anything major. They just sent an email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Let me push on that and... I'm curious just what are the most common things people do. If you're just starting on, "Okay, we need to focus on engineering experience," what do you find are the most... two or three most common improvements companies need to make?

Nicole Forsgren (00:24:45):
I'll say, I'll kind of echo that process, there's almost always a process that can be improved and that can be improved without a lot of engineering lift or a lot of engineering headcount. Most large companies, in particular, have something that is several, several steps. It's the way it is because it's the way it is, but that's no longer the way it is. And even small companies sometimes is just a little too YOLO, and you don't know what it is and you're kind of chasing everyone around. So if you can create a very lightweight process, that can also be helpful. That can be one of the best places to start, especially if you have limited exposure to the whole rest of the org. Sometimes just a team process can help.

(00:25:28):
I will say from a business leader's standpoint, a lot of what you can do is provide structure and support for this organizational change. Communicate what you're doing, communicate what the priorities are, communicate why this is important, to celebrate wins. Because if folks try to do this, just like a one-off side fully-isolated project, it's really challenging to get some good momentum, to get people to care, and to get them stay involved. Because it feels like it's just another internal project that isn't going to matter or that isn't going to get celebrated, but it has these huge upside potential returns for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):
It's interesting, what I'm hearing here is nothing about tools or technologies. It's not like move to this cloud, it's not like install this new deployment system, it's processes and people and org and morale.

Nicole Forsgren (00:26:24):
Yeah. Now, there will be technical pieces that are very important, especially now with AI, where we're rethinking how build and test systems work. We're rethinking feedback to users so that it's very, very customized in terms of what is shared and when it is shared. There are a lot of technical pieces that are involved, but that's not the only thing. It's necessary but not sufficient, and that doesn't have to be the place that you start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
I have a hard question I want to ask you that I thought of as you were talking. I feel like this is the question that most founders and heads think about. And the question is just like, how do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can? What are just maybe smells, signs that tell you, "Yeah, my team should be moving faster," versus, "This is just the way it works. This is as fast as they can move"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:27:16):
Most teams can move faster, right? Also, given what we know about cognitive load, not all speed gains are necessarily good. Or the upside is going to be kind of limited once you hit kind of a certain point, and most people are not even near that point. I don't know a single team, frankly. But how do you know? You know if you're always hearing about bills breaking, flaky tests, overly long processes, if you have to request a new system or if you need to provision a new environment, or if it's really, really hard to switch tasks or switch projects. So if someone has an opportunity to go work in another part of an org and they don't for reasons that are unclear, and not political, and anyone says anything about the system, that's usually a pretty good smell that there's friction somewhere.

(00:28:20):
Because once you finally figure out your system and you're able to get work done, the switching costs can often be really, really high to go anywhere else. So sometimes people will do that. But I've worked with companies where switching orgs within the company, you had to basically pay the same tax as a new hire because the systems were so different and they were so full of friction, and it was so difficult to do so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I love the first part of your answer especially, which is you can always move faster. I think every founder is going to love hearing that. To your point though, there's diminishing returns over time?

Nicole Forsgren (00:28:58):
Yeah. And you don't know about the quality, right? So I think that's the other side is that you can always move faster, but faster for what? Are we making the right business decisions? And I think that's especially where PMs come in. We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout. The strategy is the core piece, and then think about speeding that up. If we don't have the other pieces in place, I mean, garbage in, garbage out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
I want to follow that thread, but before I do that, just to mirror back what you shared. So signs that your team... There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to improve the productivity of your team as builds are always breaking. There's flaky tests are constantly incorrect, false positives. It's hard to context switch between different projects. You just hear people talking about the system, it's just really hard to work with. Is that roughly right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:29:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Cool, okay. So going back to the point you just made, there's a sense that AI is making teams so much faster because it's writing all this code for them. You're going to have all these asynchronous agents, engineers working for you. It feels like a core part of your message is that's just a one part of engineering work and there's so much more, including figuring out what to build... an alignment internally. Maybe just speak to just... There is a lot of opportunity to improve engineering performance productivity, but there's so many other elements that are not improved through AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:22):
Yes. Or could be in the future, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Mm-hmm.

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:26):
I think there are a lot of ways that we can pull in AI tools to help us refine our strategy, refine our message, think about the experimentation methods or targets of experimentation, or think about our total addressable market, but we need to have that strategy and plan fairly well aligned or at least have two or three alternatives that you want to test. Because now, the engineering can go, or at least the prototyping especially, much, much faster. We can throw out prototypes. We can run any tests and experiments that are customer facing, assuming that we have the infrastructure in place, which allows us to learn and progress much faster before. In some places, it used to take months to get something through production to do A/B testing and get feedback. We can do this in a day or two, definitely under a week. But we want to make sure that we're building and testing the right things, "Are we partnering with the right... Do we have the data that we need?"

(00:31:24):
And I will say AI can actually be a pretty good partner there if you have a good conversation with it, and then also check with you experts, "What type of data should I be looking at? What type of instrumentation do I need? What type of analysis can I do?" Because then, you can also go to your data science team and say, "I'm planning on doing this. I'd like to..." Let's not just YOLO A/B tests because that can be... It's a shame to do a large test and end up disrupting users or disrupting customers, or breaking privacy or security protocols and also end up with data that's unusable because you just can't get the signal that you're looking for. But now, I'm also seeing people kind of accelerate that into a few days versus a few weeks. So they can start those key stakeholder discussions from a much more informed kind of filled out space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy-to-organize tab.

(00:33:04):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A-dot-I-O-slash-Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.

(00:33:33):
I love that you work with a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different types of businesses. I think very few people get to see inside a lot of different places. What kind of gains are you just seeing in terms of increased productivity with AI? How big of a gain have you seen?

Nicole Forsgren (00:33:49):
I'd say it's real, and I would also say we don't have great measures for it yet. We're still trying to figure out what to measure and what that looks like. One of the best is going to be velocity, all the way through the system, how quickly can you get a feature or a product or something through the system so that you can then experiment a test, either from idea to final end or even kind of a feature and a piece through the system so we can test. That's really good. Now, that's also hard to tie back directly to a particular AI tool in the hands of a particular developer. But there are some other things that we can look at and we can see, and that I've seen is, again, this kind of rapid prototyping.

(00:34:36):
I hate lines of code, but I'm going to use the lines of code. We do see... I know I worked with some folks who had kind of a whole set of companies they were looking at, and they found that AI was generating significantly more code for the people who were using it regularly. But then, they also found that for folks who were regular users of AI coding environments, AI ADEs, the tool kind of gave them more code. And then the engineers themselves, the increase was double what the coding agent had given them. So one, I'd say, probably it's kind of a secondary or knock on or just a smell is it can unblock you. It can speed up the work that you would already do. I know sometimes when I work, the first few minutes, it's hard for me to start. But once I get started, I'm there. So they're really good at unblocking and unlocking that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):
Something I've seen people on Twitter sharing is how good OpenAI Codex, especially, is at finding really gnarly bugs. And I think it was Karpathy that shared it. He was so stuck on a bug and, no AI tool could figure it out. And then the latest version of Codex spent an hour or something, looking into it, and found it for him.

Nicole Forsgren (00:35:51):
Yeah. I'm hearing incredible things like that, right? Well, and even also writing unit tests and spinning up unit tests, and creating documentation and cleaning up documentation because I know now people are like, "Oh. Well, we have agents. I don't need to read the docs because there's the code there." It turns out, agents rely on good data because it's all about how they've been trained or how they've been grounded. And better data gives you better outcomes, and some of that data includes documentation and comments. The better documentation and the better comments you have, the better performance you're going to get out of your AI tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
And AI can help you write that documentation. I've been working with Devin a little bit, and it's really good at that stuff.

Nicole Forsgren (00:36:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
Okay. Let's talk about this framework, this book. So you're publishing a book called Frictionless, which sounds like a dream, "How do you create a dev team that's frictionless?" It's called Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the Age of AI. There's a seven-step process to this. Walk us through this and maybe give us just context on this book, who it's meant for, what problem it solves, and then the seven steps.

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:00):
I will say, I also wrote this with Abi Noda who has just... of DX. He has incredible experience in the space. He's worked with hundreds of companies and so it was kind of nice bouncing ideas off of him. Also, thanks to all of the engineering leads and DevEx leads, and CTOs, and engineers that we talked to to make sure that our smells were right. So who is this book for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
Let me take a tangent on Abi, and DX, since you mentioned him. This is super interesting, and I think it connects so directly with this conversation. Abi started this company called DX, which is such a great name for a company around developer experience. They just sold the company for a billion dollars to Atlassian. It's a very high multiple on their ARR. It, to me, shows exactly why this conversation is so valuable, just how much value companies are putting into improving developer experience. Atlassian would spend a billion dollars on this. It's an early stage-ish startup. It was doing really well and people loved it, but it was like early stage-ish, a billion dollars. And the idea is they have all these companies working using Jira and all their products. They're all trying to figure out how do we measure productivity. It's worth a lot of money to them. And I know you were an early advisor to them too, so-

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):
... it just shows us how important this is.

Nicole Forsgren (00:38:17):
Yeah. Well, I think it also shows us how much value you can get out of this. There's so much low-hanging fruit, there's so much unlocked potential, and it's hard to know where to start a lot of times even in... I've been at large companies that have a lot of expertise and a lot of really, really smart people. But if you haven't kind of been in this space and thinking about it this way, it's hard to know where to start or it's easy to make simple mistakes up front that mean you kind of need to start over later. So I guess it also brings us back to, "Who is this book for?" It's for anyone that cares about DevEx, so definitely technology leaders, anyone who's trying to kick off a DevEx program, or is working on a DevEx DevEx improvement program. I think it's particularly relevant for PMs because if you're PMing something that involves software building and creating software, improving DevEx will only help your team. And also, you have key skills and insights and instincts that are so important to DevEx that many times, I will say, I've seen engineering teams just miss.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Okay. What's the framework? What are the steps? Where do people start?

Nicole Forsgren (00:39:35):
The book goes through a seven-step process, and then also kind of provides some key kind of principles at the end. Step one is to start the journey. So assuming you're kicking off, you can start the journey. And this involves what we have already talked about. Go talk to people, have a listening tour, synthesize what you learn, visualize the workflow and tools, get a handle on what the current state is. Step two is to get a quick win. So start small, get a quick win, pick the right projects, share out what you've done. Step three is using data to optimize the work. So establish some of your data foundation, find the data that's there, start collecting new data, use some surveys for some really fast insights and may include example surveys. Step four then is to decide strategy and priority. Once you have some data, then you need to know of all the things that are potentially broken. And if you've already gotten your quick win of all the things that are left, "What should I do next?" So we walk through some evaluation frameworks there.

(00:40:43):
Step five is to sell your strategy. Once you've decided, now you have to kind of convince everyone else. So now you want to get feedback, you want to share why this is the right strategy right now. Step six is to drive change at your scale. So here, we address folks that have local scope of control. If you're starting on just a dev team, you want to do it yourself, kind of grassroots effort or global scope of control. If you're the VP of developer experience or something, there are some things that you can leverage for a top down, and then how do you drive change when you're kind of somewhere in the middle, because you can leverage both types of strategies. And then step seven is to evaluate your progress and show value, and then kind of loop back around.

(00:41:27):
I will say that we wrote this so that you could kind of jump into any step wherever you are right now. If you're kicking off a team or an initiative, you'll probably want to start at step one. You should definitely start at step one. If you're joining an existing initiative, you could jump into picking the priority or implementing the changes. So those are the seven steps. There's a seven steps, there are a few practices that we also recommend. So thinking about resourcing it, change management, making technology sustainable, and then also bringing a PM lens to this, "How can we think about developer experience as a product, and how do we think about the metrics that we have as a product?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):
Awesome, okay. I have questions. Point people to the book real quick. What's the URL? How do they get it? When does it come out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:18):
Yeah, developerexperiencebook.com. Right now, you can sign up for the mailing list. We'll let you know when it's out on pre-order, and we'll also be sharing pieces of the workbook. So we've got almost a hundred page workbook that goes along with the book, and then it should be out by end of year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
Okay. So one piece of this is just this term developer experience feels very intentional in that it's not developer productivity, developer work. It's how do we make developer experiences better at our company, which includes they get more done, but also they're happier and things like that. So I think that's an important element of this, right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):
Okay.

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:56):
Because, again, it's not just about productivity. We talked about this from the frame and the lens of, "We need to be building the right thing." And you want to be productive, but you also want to be thinking about... and this is what engineers are also just really incredibly good at, give them a problem and don't tell them how to solve it, and then they can solve it better. They have the freedom, they have the innovation, they have the creativity so that they can solve this problem. If it's only about productivity, then it's just lines of code or number PRs or whatever. But we really want to talk about value and how do we unlock value, and how do we get value faster. And that involves, yes, making them more productive and removing friction because then, they have the flow and the cognitive load and the things that we kind of talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:41):
Awesome, okay. And then say someone wants to start this team, what does it usually look like. At Airbnb, I remember this team forming. It was just like an engineer or two, getting it started and taking charge. What do you recommend as the pilot team, and then what does it look like as it grows?

Nicole Forsgren (00:43:57):
There are a few ways to do this, right? So if you're doing it yourself, you could do it with a couple of engineers, maybe a PM or a PGM or a TPM to kind of help communicate. Because really, comms plans are just so important here. On a small scale, what we want to do is look for those quick wins, look for things that you can do at small scale. Some folks call them things like paper cuts. There small things that you can do to help people see the value and feel the benefit themselves, "How can a developer's work get better? How can their day-to-day work get better? Kind of build momentum from there?" If you're working from a top-down structure and you have the remit, you still want some quick wins, but those quick wins can look a little more global in scale because you have the infrastructure or the backing to make different types of changes that aren't only local.

(00:44:56):
So an example of a small local change could be just cleaning up your tests, your test suites. Any team could do that, any team could do that. At more global scale, it might be changing organization-wide process that is just overly cumbersome or throwing some resourcing into cleaning up the provisioning environment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Okay. What kind of impact have you seen from teams like this forming, on the engineering teams at their companies?

Nicole Forsgren (00:45:21):
I'll say I've seen a huge impact for smaller companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars for large companies or in the billions. Well, also, we need to learn how to communicate that, "What does the math look like?" Many times, we can look at saving time, we can look at saving costs, we can look at a lot of different things. We can look at speed to value as speed to market. We can look at risk reduction, but the gains really are there. I will mention that it tends to follow something like the J-curve. So you'll have a couple of quick wins and it'll look like a big win, and then you'll hit kind of a little divot where suddenly the really obvious projects, the low-hanging fruit are handled. So now, we need to do a little bit of work. We might need to build out a little bit more infrastructure. We might need to build out a little more telemetry, so that we can capture the things we want to capture. And then once we get that done, then we start to see those benefits really compound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:16):
So going back to that measurement number, what do you recommend? How do people find these numbers? Because I think that's so much of the power of this is like, "We saved a million dollars doing this." What do you look at to figure that out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:46:28):
I think there are a few different things to keep in mind, like who is our key audience, and we usually have a few key audiences. We really want to be able to speak to developers because they're the ones that are going to be using the systems. They'll be partnering with you on either building them or at least providing feedback about what you're doing. So for them, we often want to frame this in terms of things they care about. So time savings. If something gets faster, they can save time. They don't spend time doing setup when they don't need to anymore, related to status reduced toil. So compliance and security are super important. Also, many times it requires several manual steps that... I don't say they're not value add. They're not value add from an individual human perspective. If we can automate as much as possible, that's great, and improved focus time.

(00:47:22):
That's from the developer side of you. Leadership often cares about... They care about those things, but they often care more about other things. So we could talk about usually costs in dollars, "Can we accelerate revenue? What does our time to value look like? What is our velocity? How quickly can we get feedback from customers?" And for folks and organizations that are in really competitive environments, that can be really compelling because it's all about speed. We could talk about saving money. Here, we can look at maybe quantifying savings. One example is test and build. If we can clean up a test and build suite to a developer, they really want to hear about time saved and more reliable systems. There's less toil because they don't have to keep re-running tests or kind of go clean up test suites.

(00:48:13):
From the business perspective, cleaning up a test in a build suite can be cloud cost savings because all of those tests are running somewhere on a cloud. And if they always fail or if it's just kind of a waste of spend, that can be useful, recovering some capacity. We can always talk about time and productivity gains, "How much equivalent developer time are we losing on things that are not necessarily value add?" And then sometimes we can correlate to business outcomes and correlate is usually the best we can do here, but there can be some pretty compelling correlations in terms of speeding up time to value and increase market share, for example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
Let me follow that thread and come back to this, what I think is the biggest question people have right now with AI and productivity, and I don't think anyone has the answer yet, but I'm curious to get your take of just what should people do today? What's the best approach to understanding what impact AI tools are having on their productivity? Because they're spending all this money on there. I don't know, what are we getting out of this? So I guess things are moving faster, but I don't know. So if someone had to just like, "Okay, here's what I should probably try to do," what would be your best advice here for measuring the impact of AI tools on productivity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:49:28):
I would say it depends. In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about. We are usually pretty good at figuring out what matters to developers and we could communicate that to them. But if we're trying to just identify two or three data points to really kind of focus on, because when we're first starting with data, sometimes it can be challenging, what do they care about? Think about the messaging you've been hearing. Have they been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed. Think about ways that you can capture metrics for speed from feature to production or feature to customer or feature to experiment and what that feedback loop looks like if they're talking about profit margin all the time.

(00:50:18):
Now, we always talk about money because this is business. But if that seems to be an overarching narrative, look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost. Or sometimes you'll reinvent, change a process, and then you no longer need as many vendors. So reductions in vendor spent can also help there. I say also it depends because sometimes they'll say something, leadership will say something, and it kind of comes up as a theme. If you could solve a problem that they have or it's something that they're focused on, if you can slightly reframe it even, like if they're calling everything developer productivity, go ahead and call it productivity. If they're calling it velocity, and velocity is what matters to them, think about how to frame this in terms of velocity. If they're talking about transformation or disruption, how does this help with the disruption? Because then, it will resonate with them. We don't want to make them work to understand what it is that we're doing and the value that we provide.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
That is such good advice. Just to reflect back, the advice here is if your company's trying to figure out what sort of impact are AI tools having on our company, first, it's just like, what does the company care about most? What do leaders care about most? Could be market share, could be profit margin, could be velocity. We need higher velocity or we need to transform, transformation. So your advice there is figure that out based on words and phrases you're hearing. Then figure out ways to measure that, ways to measure market share growing, profit margin increasing. I love these examples, like time from feature, idea to production or to experiment, so maybe start tracking that. If it's margin, it's money saved by fewer tests, failing or some vendor you don't have to pay for, things like that. And then velocity, I imagine that's where things like DORA come in of just speed of engineering, shipping, or... What would you think about there for velocity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:52:16):
I would say it's actually one of those... I would pick as broad a swathe as you can. So if you can go from idea to customer or idea to experiment, how long does that take? How long does it typically take, and how long can it take, and does it take now with improved use of AI tooling and reduction in friction? That's where I will say, we talk about this a little bit in the book, how do we deal with attribution challenges? What was responsible for this? Was it the DevEx or was it AI? Go ahead and disclose that. Say, "Yes, we rolled out AI tools. We also had this effort in DevEx. They partnered very closely together." Both of them probably contributed to this, right? If we had AI tools without the DevEx improvements, we probably would've had some improvements, but not nearly as much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):
If people were starting to do this today, say they're just like, "I want to start measuring developer experience," are there a two or three metrics everybody basically needs they should just start measuring ASAP?

Nicole Forsgren (00:53:10):
If you're just starting today and if you have nothing at all, talk to people, obviously. After that, I would do surveys because surveys can give you a nice overall view of the landscape quickly so that you know where the big kind of challenges are. I say that because if you're just starting, you might not have instrumentation through your system, all the metrics. And if you do already, it might not be what you think you want. Metrics that were designed without purpose, questionable. Metrics that were designed for another purpose, they might work for what you want, but they might not, so we can't just assume we have them. That's one reason I like surveys, and we include an example in the book. You can just ask a few questions, "How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?" and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three.

(00:54:12):
Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly? Because sometimes it hits you every single day, and you're just mad about it. Sometimes it only hits you once a quarter because it's end of quarter, but it's so onerous, and then kind of open text, like, "Is there anything else we should know?" That can give you incredible signal because by making folks prioritize the top three things... Let them pick everything, it makes the data super, super messy. But three things and how often, you can just come up with a score or a weighted score if you want, and then go kind of dig into, where should that data be? What data do we need? But also, then you've got at least some kind of baseline. It'll be a subjective baseline, but now you'll know what the biggest challenges are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
I love how all this just comes back just starting by talking to people and asking them these things, which is very similar to product management and just building great products is, have you talked to your customers? Everyone thinks they're doing this, but most people are not doing this enough.

Nicole Forsgren (00:55:17):
And I will say one thing that's challenging when you think about getting data, so interviews are data and that's important, surveys are a little more quantified because we can turn it into counts, but that's where we also want to be careful. A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, "Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?" You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something? So it can be really difficult to untangle what the signal is you're actually getting there, and so it is worth the time chatting with someone who's familiar with survey design, having a conversation with Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT around, "Here are the survey questions. Or can you propose some?" And then make sure you take a couple of rounds. Is this a good survey question? What questions can I answer from the data that I get? What problems could I solve? If you can't answer a question with data, don't get it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
And you have example surveys in your book for folks that want to just copy and paste and not have to think about this much.

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:28):
Yeah, example surveys, a lot of example questions. We even recommend what the format, what the flow should look like, how long it should be, how long it should not be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
One thing that I was reading is that you don't love happiness surveys specifically, asking engineers how happy they are, is that true? If so, why is that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:45):
I don't, no. Well, I'll say I don't love a happiness survey because there are too many things that contribute to happiness. Happiness is a lot, right? So happiness is work, happiness is family, happiness is hobbies, happiness is weekends, happiness... There are so many things that contribute to happiness. Now, that doesn't mean I don't care about happiness. I think happiness surveys are not particularly useful here. What can be helpful is satisfaction and people are like, "That's the same thing." It's not because you can ask, "Are you satisfied with this tool?" and then ask some follow-up questions. Now, those two are related because the more satisfied you are with your job and your tools and the work and your team, it contributes to happiness. I used to joke... Remember the golf commercials like, "Happy cows like happy cheese"?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):
No.

Nicole Forsgren (00:57:35):
I had a Calabrian. That was the best. Happy devs make happy code. They write better programs, they do better work, they're better team members and collaborators. But capturing and trying to directly influence happiness, that's not what we are here for. It's too challenging, it's too all-encompassing. Satisfaction can give us some signal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:59):
In a totally different direction, in terms of just tools you see people using, are there any that just like, "Oh, yeah, this one's really commonly great." For people, this is just a tool people are finding a lot of success with. There's the common ones, Copilot, Cursor. I don't know. Is there anything that stands out that you want to share, just like, "Hey, you should check this tool out. People seem to love it"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:21):
I think they're huge, right? Copilot, Cursor, Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):
Claude Code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:26):
Yep, Claude Code. I love Claude Code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):
I have a whole post coming on ways to use Claude Code for non-engineering use cases.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:35):
Cool. Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
It's so interesting. For example, Claude Code, "Find ways to clean up storage on my laptop," and it just tells you there's a bunch of files. It's just like ChatGPT running on your computer and you could do all kinds of crazy stuff on your computer for you, like a mini God.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:36):
I'm going to do that now. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
It's so good. Yeah, that's why I'm writing this. I had Dan Shipper was on the podcast and he said Claude Code is the most underrated AI tool out there because people don't realize what it's capable of. It's not just for coding, and that's what I'm trying to explore more and more. Okay. Is there anything else that you think would be valuable to help people improve their developer experience, help them adapt to this new world of AI and engineering that we haven't covered?

Nicole Forsgren (00:59:22):
I think something that's important to think about in general is to bring a product mindset to any type of DevEx improvements that are happening, and also the metrics that we collect and capture. By that, I mean we want to identify a problem, make sure we're solving a problem for a set of users. We want to think about creating MVPs and experiments and get fast feedback, do some rapid iteration. We want to have a strategy. We want to know who our addressable market is. We want to know what success is. We want to basically have a go-to-market function. We need to have comms. We need to get continuous feedback from our customers. We want to keep improving. And, at some point, we want to think about sunsetting something. Is it in maintenance mode? Is it sun setting?

(01:00:12):
And I think that's important in general, but I think it's extra important now because when we have AI tools, we're using AI tools, we're embedding AI into our products, things are changing so rapidly that it can be really important to take half a beat and say, "Okay, what's the problem I'm trying to solve right here? Is this metric that we've had for the last 10 years still important or should this be sunset because it's not really important anymore? It's not driving the types of decisions and actions that I need."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Before we get to our exciting lightning round, I want to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. Is there some way that you've found a use for an AI tool in your life, in your work that you think might be fun to share, that you think might be useful to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:00:55):
I have been working on some home design and redecorating rooms and stuff. I'm working with a designer because I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, I'm not good at this. But I've really been loving ChatGPT and Gemini especially to render pictures for me, so I can give it the floor plan, I can give it one shot of the room that's definitely not what it's supposed to look like, and then I can give it pictures of a couple different things, and then I can just tell it change the walls or change the furniture layout or change something. It helps me and it's relatively quick. It helps me kind of visualize the things... Again, I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, so I know if I like it or not, which is probably a very random use, but it's fun for now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
My wife does exactly the same thing. She's sending me constantly, "Here's what this rug will look like in our living room. Here's this water feature." It's so good and it keeps getting better. It's just like, "Wow, that's exactly our house with this new rug," and all you do is just upload these two photos and just like, "Cool. How would this look in our room?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've been impressed a couple times. Definitely the machines are listening to us. It's given me a mock-up of a room or something and then it throws in a dog bed, because I have dogs. I'm like, "I did not tell you to do that, but yeah, that's probably the color and style of dog bed that I should have in this room."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):
Speaking of that, have you tried this use case, ask ChatGPT, "Generate an image of what you think my house looks like based on everything you know about me."

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:22):
I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
Because it has memory and it remembers everything you've talked about, and it's hilarious. You got to do it.

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:29):
Okay, that's on my to-do list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
There we go. Bonus use case. Nicole, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:38):
Awesome. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:43):
Outlive by Peter Attia is fantastic. Another one that's I guess maybe related, I hurt my back so it's not great, Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill is incredible. Shout out to anyone who has hurt lower back. It's for a lay person to read through and figure out how to fix lower back problems. It's kind of a random one. I will say I love How Big Things Get Done. I can't pronounce the names. I think one's... There's Scandinavian, one is. It kind of dissects really large projects through recent-ish history and where they failed and why. And I think it's really interesting for us to think about, especially now in this AI moment where basically all of our at least software systems are going to be changing. So how do we think about approaching what is essentially going to be a very large project? And then, sorry, I'm going to throw in a bonus one, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis. Matt Velloso recommended it to me, and it's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Yes, I read that-

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:44):
I audibly gasped at the last sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
Oh. I was like, "What?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:47):
I was [inaudible 01:03:48]. Yeah, I was not expecting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
I read that and I do not remember that last sentence. Oh, man. Okay, cool. Next question. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you recently watched and enjoyed?

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:57):
I'll say I watch Love Is Blind. If I got to shut down at the end of the day, Love Is Blind is fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):
There's a new season out.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:03):
Yeah, very excited... and Shrinking. Have you seen Shrinking?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
No. I think I started The Therapist and yeah, I gave it a shot.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:12):
Strongly recommend it. It's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
Sweet. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some kitchen gadgets, some clothing.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:21):
Yeah, the Ninja Creami is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Did you say this last time?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:25):
I don't know. I may have. I don't think so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:29):
Somebody said this and I still remember it. It's like-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:30):
It's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
... you make ice cream and stuff with it, right?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:33):
Yeah, and you can basically freeze a protein shake and then it turns it into ice cream-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
Oh, man.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:37):
... which is delicious. Another one is a Jura coffee maker. I'd love good coffee and I'm not great at making it, so I can just push the button and it'll give me anything I want, including lattes, cappuccinos or anything. So that's kind of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
Sweet, okay. Do you have a favorite-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:54):
Just sugar and caffeine. I just need a power through the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
There's the engineering productivity 101.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:01):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):
Oh, man. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or life and come back to in various ways?

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:09):
Yeah, I think one that's come up a couple times, it's not a verbatim thing, I think it's more the vibe, hindsight is 2020, but it's also really dumb. I think if we made the best decision we could at the time with the information that we had available, then it is what it is. If you make a bad decision because you made a bad decision and you knew better, you had the information, not great. I don't think we give ourselves or other people enough grace because we always end up finding more information out later.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Hear, hear. Final question. I was going to ask you something else, but as we are preparing for this, you shared that you have a new role at Google. Maybe just talk about that, what you're up to there, why you joined Google, anything folks should know.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:53):
Sure. I am senior director of developer intelligence and core developer. It's super exciting and super fun because of all of these things we've been talking about. It's focused on Google and all their properties and their underlying infrastructure, how can we improve developer experience, developer productivity, velocity, all of these things we've been talking about and, because kind of the numbers person, how do we want to think about measuring it, how does measurement change, how do feedback loops change, how can we improve the experience throughout and then kind of drive that change through an organization in ways that are meaningful and impactful and faster than they've been before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:33):
Nice job, Google, getting Nicole. What a win. I need to get some more Google stock ASAP. Okay, two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online and find your book online if they want to dig deeper? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Online, you can find the book at developerexperiencebook.com, I'm at nicolefv.com, and LinkedIn occasionally. Sometimes it's a mess. I try to wade through all of the noise. I get there to be useful, sign up for the book and the workbooks. The workbooks are free. I'd love to get any kind of feedback on what works, what doesn't. I always love hearing those kind of stories.

# How to measure AI developer productivity in 2025 | Nicole Forsgren

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:03):
Most productivity metrics are a lie. If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever. It's just too easy to gain that system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
How do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can?

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:18):
Most teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
One of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is learning how much to trust code that it generates.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:32):
We can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it. Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
So much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:45):
There's some real opportunity there to not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work. Now, we can also make a 45-minute work block useful because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by, reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:01:09):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Nicole Forsgren. With so much talk about how AI is increasing developer productivity, more and more people are asking, "How do we measure this productivity gain? And are these AI tools actually helping us or hurting how our developers work?" Nicole has been at the forefront of this space longer than anyone. She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE. She wrote the most important book in the space called Accelerate and is about to publish her newest book called Frictionless, which gives you a guide to helping your team move faster and do more in this emerging AI world. Her core thesis is that AI indeed accelerates coding. But developers aren't speeding up as much as you think because they still have to deal with broken builds and unreliable tools and processes, and a bunch of new bottlenecks that are emerging.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we chat about her current, best and very specific advice for how to measure productivity gains from AI, signs that your team could be moving faster, what companies get wrong when trying to measure engineering productivity, how AI tools are both helping and hurting engineers, including getting into flow states, her seven-step process for setting up a developer experience team at your company, how to get buy-in and measure the impact of a team like this and a ton more. This episode is for anyone looking to improve the performance of their engineering teams.

(00:05:13):
Nicole, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:16):
Thank you. It's so good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
It's so good to have you back. I was just watching our first episode, which we did two and a half years ago. I was watching it, and I was both shocked and not shocked that we barely talked about AI. The episode was called How to Measure and Improve Developer Productivity, and we got to AI barely like an hour in and we're just like, "Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen with AI and productivity." Does that just blow your mind?

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:41):
Yeah. Because it was just hitting the scene, it was the topic of so much conversation, and at the same time, so many things don't change. So many things are still important, so many things are the same. Yeah. It's also a little wild that it's been two and a half. Where does time go? Time is a social construct?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:01):
Yeah. Most of our conversation was just questions like, "Well, how might this impact people? How will we change the way we build product?" It was barely a thing back then. Now, it's the only thing that I imagine people want to talk about when they talk about engineering productivity. That's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time focusing on today. The reason I'm excited about this conversation, it feels like there's been so much money poured into AI tools increasing productivity. The fastest growing companies in the world are these engineering AI tools. And now, more and more people are just asking this question of just, "What gains are we getting out of this? How much is this actually helping us be more productive? How do we become more productive?"

(00:06:39):
You've been at the center of this world for longer than anyone. You've invented so many of the frameworks that people rely on now. So I'm really excited to have you back to talk about this stuff. I want to start with just this term DevEx, it's something that comes up a lot in this whole space, and we're going to hear this term a bunch in this conversation. Can you just explain what is DevEx, this term DevEx?

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:00):
DevEx is developer experience. And when we think about developer experience, we're really talking about what it's like to build software, day to day, for a developer. So the friction that they face, the workflows that they have to go through, any support that they have. It's important because when DevEx is poor, everything else just isn't going to help. The best processes, the best tools, the best... whatever magic you have, if the DevEx is bad, everything kind of takes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):
Within DevEx is productivity, and I think the key insight that you had and other folks in the space of that is not just productivity, but there's also engineering happiness. We're going to get into a lot of these parts, but just maybe speak to... there's productivity and there's broader components to engineers being successful at a company.

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:51):
Yeah. I love that point because productivity, first of all, is hard to define anyway. But if you're just looking at output, you can get there in a lot of different ways. But if you're getting there in ways that are high toil or high friction, then at some point, a developer is going to burn out. Or if it's super high cognitive load, if it's hard to even think about what you're doing because concentrating on the mechanics of... the plumbing of something, then you don't have the brain space left to come up with really innovative solutions and questions. So I love that it's kind of this self-reinforcing loop in terms of, "You do more work, you do better work." And it's better for people, it's better for the systems, it's better for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:34):
I was going to get to this later, but I want to actually get to this right now, this idea of flow state for engineers. I was an engineer, actually, early in my career. I went to a school for computer science. I was an engineer for 10 years. The best part of the job for me was just this flow state you enter when you're coding and building, and just things feel like so fun. It feels like AI is making that harder in a lot of ways because there's all these agents you're working with now, there's all this code that's kind of being written for you. Talk about just the importance of flow state to a developer, happiness, developer productivity, and just what you've seen AI impacting. How you've seen AI impacting that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:09:07):
Well, there are lots of different ways to talk about DevEx. One way to talk about it is kind of three key things that have components that are important of themselves, and they also kind of reinforce each other. Flow state is one of them, cognitive load is another, and then feedback loops are another. I think when you touch on this... Your question about flow state is a really good one, and I'll admit we're just a few years into this. We're still figuring out what the best flow state and cognitive requirements are for people in this because, to your point, sometimes we're getting interrupted all the time. You don't just get in the flow and lock down, and write a whole bunch of code and do the typing of a whole bunch of code as much anymore. Instead, you're kind of creating a prompt, getting some code back and reviewing the code, trying to integrate what's happening in the system, and that can really interrupt.

(00:10:02):
At the same time though, it can contribute to flow if... I've seen some senior engineers pull together some tool chains that are really incredible, where they figured out how to keep the flow going. The fast feedback loops really, really work well for them. They can kind of assign out different pieces to agents. It helps them keep in the flow in terms of... Instead of details and line-by-line writing, they're in the flow in terms of, "What's my goal? What are the pieces that I need to get there? How quickly can I get there? So then, I can step back and kind of evaluate everything, and then dive back in and fix some pieces."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Is there anything more you could say about this engineer that figured out this really cool workflow, about just what that looks like?

Nicole Forsgren (00:10:39):
I've spoken with a handful of them, and I've kind of watched them work. I haven't built it myself yet. It's on my list. They've been able to set up this really incredible workspace and workflow where... Right now, a lot of us play around with tools and... We'll put in a prompt and we'll get a few lines back or maybe we'll put in a prompt and we'll get whole programs back. Well, what they can do is they can... Many times I'll see them say, to help prime it, "This is what I want to build. It needs to have these basic architectural components. It needs to have this kind of a stack. It needs to follow this general workflow. Help me think that through," and it'll kind of design it for it. And then for each piece, it'll assign an agent to go work on each pace in parallel, and then it'll say and upfront, "These need to be able to work together, make sure it's architected correctly. Make sure we use appropriate APIs and conventions."

(00:11:30):
Then at the end, they can let it run for a few minutes. They can think through something else that's interesting or they anticipate is going to be hairy, and they come back to something that's probably a little better than vibe coded. Because they were so systematic about it upfront, they're much closer to something that looks like production code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:51):
So what I'm hearing is spending a little time upfront planning, what all these AI engineers are doing, versus just powering through and just figuring out as you go.

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
Okay, cool. Let me get to this quite a core question that I think on is a lot of people's minds. A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams, "Is this improving our productivity? Is this hurting our productivity?" So let me just start with this question, how are people doing this wrong currently when they try to measure their productivity gains with AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:23):
I'll say most productivity metrics are a lie. It's really tricky because, historically... Now, look, lines of code has always been a bad metric, but many folks still use lines of code-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):
[inaudible 00:12:37].

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:37):
... yeah, as some proxy as some proxy for output or productivity or complexity or something. Well, now, for many of the systems, that they would sometimes whisper and not super talk about that uses lines of code, it's just blown out of the water because, "What do you mean by lines of code?" If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever and add tons of comments. We know that agents and LLMs tend to be very verbose by definition, and so it's just too easy to gain that system and then introduce complexity and technical debt into all of the work that you're doing. I will say there are some things that we can kind of watch and pay attention to because... So lines of code as a productivity metric isn't great, it's pretty bad. But now, it's kind of more relevant if we can tease out which code came from people and which code came from AI because now we can answer downstream questions.

(00:13:40):
"What is the code survivability rate? What is the quality of our code? Is our code being fed back into trained systems? And for that code that's retraining systems later, especially if we're doing fine-tuning and local tuning, how much of that is machine generated? What types of loops is that creating, and what types of patterns or biases might it be inadvertently introducing?" On the one hand, it's not good as a productivity metric, but it can be useful. I'll even say the same for DORA. I have done DORA metrics, their speed metrics, their stability metrics. If that's all you're looking at, it's not going to be sufficient anymore because AI has now changed the way we think about feedback loops. They need to be much faster. Now, what DORA's meant for, kind of assessing the pipeline overall in terms of speed and stability. Still, that works. But we can't just blindly apply the existing metrics we've used before because we'll miss super important phenomenon and changes in the way people work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:38):
Interesting. You invented DORA, that was kind of the main framework people used for a long time to measure productivity. And then there's SPACE, there's Core 4, there's probably others. So what I'm hearing here is all these are kind of out of date now, where AI is contributing large portions of code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:14:55):
I will say if it is a prescriptive metric, it needs to be used only in the way it was prescribed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:00):
So

Nicole Forsgren (00:15:01):
DORA 4, there are four key metrics. There's two speed metrics, deployment frequency and lead time. So code commit to code deploy. There's stability metrics, MTTR and change fail rate. If those are used to assess the speed of the pipeline and the general performance of the pipeline, that's great. If you're trying to use those to understand... Because implied in that is feedback loops, right, because you used to kind of get feedback from customers. But we can't just use that blindly now when we're using AI, as an example, because we have feedback loops much earlier and not even just at the local build and test phase. We have feedback loops throughout, and even sometimes in the middle of some of the pipeline, that we really want to leverage in ways that weren't as useful before. I won't say they weren't possible, but we just didn't really focus there.

(00:15:53):
So those are prescriptive metrics. When we think about SPACE, SPACE is a framework. It doesn't tell you what metric to use. So I'll say, sometimes people get real frustrated because I didn't tell them what to measure. But now, I think that's the power of it. We're actually seeing that SPACE applies fairly well in these new emerging contexts like AI because we still want to look at... SPACE is an acronym. We still want to look at satisfaction. We still want to look at performance, what's the outcome. We still want to look at activity. Yes, in some ways, lines of code and number of PRs can be useful for something, or number of alerts or number of things, activities or counts. Seize communication and collaboration, this is also super important and useful because it's how our systems communicate with each other, and also how our people do. "What proportion of work is being offloaded to a chat bot versus talking to a senior engineer on the team?" More isn't always better and less isn't always better, it depends.

(00:16:50):
And then efficiency and flow, "Can people get in the flow? How much time does it take to do things? What is the flow like through our system?" Here, I would probably add a couple of dimensions. So chatting with some of the early authors to say trust. Not to say trust wasn't important before, but now it's very, very front of mind. Right? Before you build your code, if the compile comes back, you're fine. And that's the way it is. LLMs are non-deterministic. Right now, we can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it, so, "Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write? And if it doesn't meet, is that fine?" So it depends on... Prescriptive. You got to make sure you're using it fit for purpose. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
We're going to get to your current thinking on the best way to do this stuff. You have a book coming out that explains how to do this well, so we're going to get to that. One thing I wanted to highlight in our last chat that we had, you highlighted that one of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is trust, understanding and learning how much to trust the code that it generates, and also how much... you said this, two and a half years ago, that so much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code. That's exactly what I'm hearing.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:10):
I think it'll be interesting to see how that impacts the way we structure work moving forward. We were talking about flow state and cognitive load. Now that our attention has to focus on things at certain times and it's broken up from how we used to do it, I think there's some real opportunity there to, not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:31):
Can you say more about that? Just what is that? What are you thinking will be happening? Where do you think things go? What are you seeing working?

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:37):
This is purely speculative. But for example, Gloria Mark has done some really good work on attention and deep work, and humans can get about four hours of good deep work a day. That's about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:52):
Yeah,. I feel that.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:54):
That's kind of the upper limit-ish for the most part, and I'm sure people are going to be like, "Well, I am superhuman and I can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
What if you take 20 grams of creatine?

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:01):
Right. What if we microdose?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Yeah, exact;y.

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:06):
Yeah. So in the context of knowing we have about four hours of good deep work... I'm sure many of us have probably hit this, right? We have good periods. Maybe it's morning, maybe it's afternoon for folks. And then you hit a time where you're like, "I'm going to clean up my inbox because that is all I can do right now. I can be functional, but I'm not going to come up with my best innovative, problem solving, authoring, code writing work." A lot of times, the way to do that and to get into it is to have these long chunks to get into flow and to get that deep work. Usually, I'm [inaudible 00:19:43] two hours-ish. An hour can be tricky because it could take time to get into that state. Okay. Well, when we think about what it used to be like, back in the old days, three years ago, three and a half years ago, we could block off four hours of time and we could probably get two or three hours of really good work done. Because we were just focused, right? There were no interruptions, minimal interruptions.

(00:20:05):
Now, the nature of writing code and systems itself is interrupt driven or full of interruptions, at least, because you start something and then it interjects. So how do we think about that? Does that mean that a four-hour word block is still useful? Probably. But does that mean that now we can also make a 45-minute work block useful? Because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system and all the things. So I think that's a really, really interesting area that's just ripe for questions and opportunity. And please, folks, do this research and come back to me because... It might not make my list, but it's such a great question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
That is so interesting. Essentially, every engineer is turning into an EM, engineering manager, coordinating all of these junior AI engineers. So your point is even if you have a 30-hour block, you can get deep into code, but you can unblock all these AI engineers that are running off doing tasks. Plus, your point is they remind you of just like, "Here's where you left off. Okay. You can just jump into this code, maybe make some tweaks."

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):
So interesting. Let me zoom out a little bit and... Before we get into your framework for how to approach developer experience, the latest thinking you've got, beyond just obviously engineers doing more is great, what's your best pitch for why companies should really, really focus on developer experience?

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:37):
I hate to say return of investment, but the business value is... the opportunity here is huge. In general, we write software for fun and for hobbies, but we also have software because it meets a business need. It helps us with market share, it helps us attract and retain customers, it helps us do all of these things. And I think DevEx is important because it enables all of that software creation, it enables all of that problem solving. It enables the super rapid experimentation with customers that... Before, you'd need a while for a prototype and maybe a little bit longer to actually flight it through an A/B test on a production system. You can do it in hours, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):
Maybe the opposite end of the spectrum, getting very tactical, before we get into the larger framework, what's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to help their developer experience maybe get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:22:35):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. I love that the audience of this podcast is primarily PMs because they tend to be really good at this. And I would say start with listening and not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, "Well, I'm just going to build this tool," or, "I'm going to build this thing." Often you build a thing that you yourself have had a challenge with or that is easy to do, easy to automate. And if you just go talk to people and ask the developers like, "Think of yesterday, what did you do yesterday? Walk me through it. What were the points that were just delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you get slowed down? Where was there friction?" If you go talk to a handful of people, a lot of times, you can surface a handful of things that are relatively low lift and still have impact or you can identify a process that's unnecessarily complex and slow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:36):
So the listening to, I hear, almost is you want to help your teams move faster and be happier eng teams. Your advice is just, "Before you do anything, just go ask them what is bothering you."

Nicole Forsgren (00:23:46):
Go ask them, yeah. And trust me, most developers are going to be more than happy to tell you what's broken and what's bad. I'll say, there was one company that I had worked with. I remember they had a process that was really difficult and it was on an old mainframe system, and they were going to have to replat the whole thing and so they never went to work on it or talk about it. Everyone hated it because it was this huge delay. I mean, all they had to do was change a process. Sometimes all you have to do is change a process. And they changed it so that instead of... I think someone had to print it out and walk it down three or four flights, and they get approval. And then someone else had to walk it back up, and so it was just that interim. They didn't replat anything. They didn't redesign anything major. They just sent an email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Let me push on that and... I'm curious just what are the most common things people do. If you're just starting on, "Okay, we need to focus on engineering experience," what do you find are the most... two or three most common improvements companies need to make?

Nicole Forsgren (00:24:45):
I'll say, I'll kind of echo that process, there's almost always a process that can be improved and that can be improved without a lot of engineering lift or a lot of engineering headcount. Most large companies, in particular, have something that is several, several steps. It's the way it is because it's the way it is, but that's no longer the way it is. And even small companies sometimes is just a little too YOLO, and you don't know what it is and you're kind of chasing everyone around. So if you can create a very lightweight process, that can also be helpful. That can be one of the best places to start, especially if you have limited exposure to the whole rest of the org. Sometimes just a team process can help.

(00:25:28):
I will say from a business leader's standpoint, a lot of what you can do is provide structure and support for this organizational change. Communicate what you're doing, communicate what the priorities are, communicate why this is important, to celebrate wins. Because if folks try to do this, just like a one-off side fully-isolated project, it's really challenging to get some good momentum, to get people to care, and to get them stay involved. Because it feels like it's just another internal project that isn't going to matter or that isn't going to get celebrated, but it has these huge upside potential returns for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):
It's interesting, what I'm hearing here is nothing about tools or technologies. It's not like move to this cloud, it's not like install this new deployment system, it's processes and people and org and morale.

Nicole Forsgren (00:26:24):
Yeah. Now, there will be technical pieces that are very important, especially now with AI, where we're rethinking how build and test systems work. We're rethinking feedback to users so that it's very, very customized in terms of what is shared and when it is shared. There are a lot of technical pieces that are involved, but that's not the only thing. It's necessary but not sufficient, and that doesn't have to be the place that you start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
I have a hard question I want to ask you that I thought of as you were talking. I feel like this is the question that most founders and heads think about. And the question is just like, how do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can? What are just maybe smells, signs that tell you, "Yeah, my team should be moving faster," versus, "This is just the way it works. This is as fast as they can move"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:27:16):
Most teams can move faster, right? Also, given what we know about cognitive load, not all speed gains are necessarily good. Or the upside is going to be kind of limited once you hit kind of a certain point, and most people are not even near that point. I don't know a single team, frankly. But how do you know? You know if you're always hearing about bills breaking, flaky tests, overly long processes, if you have to request a new system or if you need to provision a new environment, or if it's really, really hard to switch tasks or switch projects. So if someone has an opportunity to go work in another part of an org and they don't for reasons that are unclear, and not political, and anyone says anything about the system, that's usually a pretty good smell that there's friction somewhere.

(00:28:20):
Because once you finally figure out your system and you're able to get work done, the switching costs can often be really, really high to go anywhere else. So sometimes people will do that. But I've worked with companies where switching orgs within the company, you had to basically pay the same tax as a new hire because the systems were so different and they were so full of friction, and it was so difficult to do so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I love the first part of your answer especially, which is you can always move faster. I think every founder is going to love hearing that. To your point though, there's diminishing returns over time?

Nicole Forsgren (00:28:58):
Yeah. And you don't know about the quality, right? So I think that's the other side is that you can always move faster, but faster for what? Are we making the right business decisions? And I think that's especially where PMs come in. We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout. The strategy is the core piece, and then think about speeding that up. If we don't have the other pieces in place, I mean, garbage in, garbage out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
I want to follow that thread, but before I do that, just to mirror back what you shared. So signs that your team... There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to improve the productivity of your team as builds are always breaking. There's flaky tests are constantly incorrect, false positives. It's hard to context switch between different projects. You just hear people talking about the system, it's just really hard to work with. Is that roughly right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:29:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Cool, okay. So going back to the point you just made, there's a sense that AI is making teams so much faster because it's writing all this code for them. You're going to have all these asynchronous agents, engineers working for you. It feels like a core part of your message is that's just a one part of engineering work and there's so much more, including figuring out what to build... an alignment internally. Maybe just speak to just... There is a lot of opportunity to improve engineering performance productivity, but there's so many other elements that are not improved through AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:22):
Yes. Or could be in the future, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Mm-hmm.

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:26):
I think there are a lot of ways that we can pull in AI tools to help us refine our strategy, refine our message, think about the experimentation methods or targets of experimentation, or think about our total addressable market, but we need to have that strategy and plan fairly well aligned or at least have two or three alternatives that you want to test. Because now, the engineering can go, or at least the prototyping especially, much, much faster. We can throw out prototypes. We can run any tests and experiments that are customer facing, assuming that we have the infrastructure in place, which allows us to learn and progress much faster before. In some places, it used to take months to get something through production to do A/B testing and get feedback. We can do this in a day or two, definitely under a week. But we want to make sure that we're building and testing the right things, "Are we partnering with the right... Do we have the data that we need?"

(00:31:24):
And I will say AI can actually be a pretty good partner there if you have a good conversation with it, and then also check with you experts, "What type of data should I be looking at? What type of instrumentation do I need? What type of analysis can I do?" Because then, you can also go to your data science team and say, "I'm planning on doing this. I'd like to..." Let's not just YOLO A/B tests because that can be... It's a shame to do a large test and end up disrupting users or disrupting customers, or breaking privacy or security protocols and also end up with data that's unusable because you just can't get the signal that you're looking for. But now, I'm also seeing people kind of accelerate that into a few days versus a few weeks. So they can start those key stakeholder discussions from a much more informed kind of filled out space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy-to-organize tab.

(00:33:04):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A-dot-I-O-slash-Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.

(00:33:33):
I love that you work with a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different types of businesses. I think very few people get to see inside a lot of different places. What kind of gains are you just seeing in terms of increased productivity with AI? How big of a gain have you seen?

Nicole Forsgren (00:33:49):
I'd say it's real, and I would also say we don't have great measures for it yet. We're still trying to figure out what to measure and what that looks like. One of the best is going to be velocity, all the way through the system, how quickly can you get a feature or a product or something through the system so that you can then experiment a test, either from idea to final end or even kind of a feature and a piece through the system so we can test. That's really good. Now, that's also hard to tie back directly to a particular AI tool in the hands of a particular developer. But there are some other things that we can look at and we can see, and that I've seen is, again, this kind of rapid prototyping.

(00:34:36):
I hate lines of code, but I'm going to use the lines of code. We do see... I know I worked with some folks who had kind of a whole set of companies they were looking at, and they found that AI was generating significantly more code for the people who were using it regularly. But then, they also found that for folks who were regular users of AI coding environments, AI ADEs, the tool kind of gave them more code. And then the engineers themselves, the increase was double what the coding agent had given them. So one, I'd say, probably it's kind of a secondary or knock on or just a smell is it can unblock you. It can speed up the work that you would already do. I know sometimes when I work, the first few minutes, it's hard for me to start. But once I get started, I'm there. So they're really good at unblocking and unlocking that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):
Something I've seen people on Twitter sharing is how good OpenAI Codex, especially, is at finding really gnarly bugs. And I think it was Karpathy that shared it. He was so stuck on a bug and, no AI tool could figure it out. And then the latest version of Codex spent an hour or something, looking into it, and found it for him.

Nicole Forsgren (00:35:51):
Yeah. I'm hearing incredible things like that, right? Well, and even also writing unit tests and spinning up unit tests, and creating documentation and cleaning up documentation because I know now people are like, "Oh. Well, we have agents. I don't need to read the docs because there's the code there." It turns out, agents rely on good data because it's all about how they've been trained or how they've been grounded. And better data gives you better outcomes, and some of that data includes documentation and comments. The better documentation and the better comments you have, the better performance you're going to get out of your AI tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
And AI can help you write that documentation. I've been working with Devin a little bit, and it's really good at that stuff.

Nicole Forsgren (00:36:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
Okay. Let's talk about this framework, this book. So you're publishing a book called Frictionless, which sounds like a dream, "How do you create a dev team that's frictionless?" It's called Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the Age of AI. There's a seven-step process to this. Walk us through this and maybe give us just context on this book, who it's meant for, what problem it solves, and then the seven steps.

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:00):
I will say, I also wrote this with Abi Noda who has just... of DX. He has incredible experience in the space. He's worked with hundreds of companies and so it was kind of nice bouncing ideas off of him. Also, thanks to all of the engineering leads and DevEx leads, and CTOs, and engineers that we talked to to make sure that our smells were right. So who is this book for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
Let me take a tangent on Abi, and DX, since you mentioned him. This is super interesting, and I think it connects so directly with this conversation. Abi started this company called DX, which is such a great name for a company around developer experience. They just sold the company for a billion dollars to Atlassian. It's a very high multiple on their ARR. It, to me, shows exactly why this conversation is so valuable, just how much value companies are putting into improving developer experience. Atlassian would spend a billion dollars on this. It's an early stage-ish startup. It was doing really well and people loved it, but it was like early stage-ish, a billion dollars. And the idea is they have all these companies working using Jira and all their products. They're all trying to figure out how do we measure productivity. It's worth a lot of money to them. And I know you were an early advisor to them too, so-

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):
... it just shows us how important this is.

Nicole Forsgren (00:38:17):
Yeah. Well, I think it also shows us how much value you can get out of this. There's so much low-hanging fruit, there's so much unlocked potential, and it's hard to know where to start a lot of times even in... I've been at large companies that have a lot of expertise and a lot of really, really smart people. But if you haven't kind of been in this space and thinking about it this way, it's hard to know where to start or it's easy to make simple mistakes up front that mean you kind of need to start over later. So I guess it also brings us back to, "Who is this book for?" It's for anyone that cares about DevEx, so definitely technology leaders, anyone who's trying to kick off a DevEx program, or is working on a DevEx DevEx improvement program. I think it's particularly relevant for PMs because if you're PMing something that involves software building and creating software, improving DevEx will only help your team. And also, you have key skills and insights and instincts that are so important to DevEx that many times, I will say, I've seen engineering teams just miss.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Okay. What's the framework? What are the steps? Where do people start?

Nicole Forsgren (00:39:35):
The book goes through a seven-step process, and then also kind of provides some key kind of principles at the end. Step one is to start the journey. So assuming you're kicking off, you can start the journey. And this involves what we have already talked about. Go talk to people, have a listening tour, synthesize what you learn, visualize the workflow and tools, get a handle on what the current state is. Step two is to get a quick win. So start small, get a quick win, pick the right projects, share out what you've done. Step three is using data to optimize the work. So establish some of your data foundation, find the data that's there, start collecting new data, use some surveys for some really fast insights and may include example surveys. Step four then is to decide strategy and priority. Once you have some data, then you need to know of all the things that are potentially broken. And if you've already gotten your quick win of all the things that are left, "What should I do next?" So we walk through some evaluation frameworks there.

(00:40:43):
Step five is to sell your strategy. Once you've decided, now you have to kind of convince everyone else. So now you want to get feedback, you want to share why this is the right strategy right now. Step six is to drive change at your scale. So here, we address folks that have local scope of control. If you're starting on just a dev team, you want to do it yourself, kind of grassroots effort or global scope of control. If you're the VP of developer experience or something, there are some things that you can leverage for a top down, and then how do you drive change when you're kind of somewhere in the middle, because you can leverage both types of strategies. And then step seven is to evaluate your progress and show value, and then kind of loop back around.

(00:41:27):
I will say that we wrote this so that you could kind of jump into any step wherever you are right now. If you're kicking off a team or an initiative, you'll probably want to start at step one. You should definitely start at step one. If you're joining an existing initiative, you could jump into picking the priority or implementing the changes. So those are the seven steps. There's a seven steps, there are a few practices that we also recommend. So thinking about resourcing it, change management, making technology sustainable, and then also bringing a PM lens to this, "How can we think about developer experience as a product, and how do we think about the metrics that we have as a product?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):
Awesome, okay. I have questions. Point people to the book real quick. What's the URL? How do they get it? When does it come out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:18):
Yeah, developerexperiencebook.com. Right now, you can sign up for the mailing list. We'll let you know when it's out on pre-order, and we'll also be sharing pieces of the workbook. So we've got almost a hundred page workbook that goes along with the book, and then it should be out by end of year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
Okay. So one piece of this is just this term developer experience feels very intentional in that it's not developer productivity, developer work. It's how do we make developer experiences better at our company, which includes they get more done, but also they're happier and things like that. So I think that's an important element of this, right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):
Okay.

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:56):
Because, again, it's not just about productivity. We talked about this from the frame and the lens of, "We need to be building the right thing." And you want to be productive, but you also want to be thinking about... and this is what engineers are also just really incredibly good at, give them a problem and don't tell them how to solve it, and then they can solve it better. They have the freedom, they have the innovation, they have the creativity so that they can solve this problem. If it's only about productivity, then it's just lines of code or number PRs or whatever. But we really want to talk about value and how do we unlock value, and how do we get value faster. And that involves, yes, making them more productive and removing friction because then, they have the flow and the cognitive load and the things that we kind of talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:41):
Awesome, okay. And then say someone wants to start this team, what does it usually look like. At Airbnb, I remember this team forming. It was just like an engineer or two, getting it started and taking charge. What do you recommend as the pilot team, and then what does it look like as it grows?

Nicole Forsgren (00:43:57):
There are a few ways to do this, right? So if you're doing it yourself, you could do it with a couple of engineers, maybe a PM or a PGM or a TPM to kind of help communicate. Because really, comms plans are just so important here. On a small scale, what we want to do is look for those quick wins, look for things that you can do at small scale. Some folks call them things like paper cuts. There small things that you can do to help people see the value and feel the benefit themselves, "How can a developer's work get better? How can their day-to-day work get better? Kind of build momentum from there?" If you're working from a top-down structure and you have the remit, you still want some quick wins, but those quick wins can look a little more global in scale because you have the infrastructure or the backing to make different types of changes that aren't only local.

(00:44:56):
So an example of a small local change could be just cleaning up your tests, your test suites. Any team could do that, any team could do that. At more global scale, it might be changing organization-wide process that is just overly cumbersome or throwing some resourcing into cleaning up the provisioning environment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Okay. What kind of impact have you seen from teams like this forming, on the engineering teams at their companies?

Nicole Forsgren (00:45:21):
I'll say I've seen a huge impact for smaller companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars for large companies or in the billions. Well, also, we need to learn how to communicate that, "What does the math look like?" Many times, we can look at saving time, we can look at saving costs, we can look at a lot of different things. We can look at speed to value as speed to market. We can look at risk reduction, but the gains really are there. I will mention that it tends to follow something like the J-curve. So you'll have a couple of quick wins and it'll look like a big win, and then you'll hit kind of a little divot where suddenly the really obvious projects, the low-hanging fruit are handled. So now, we need to do a little bit of work. We might need to build out a little bit more infrastructure. We might need to build out a little more telemetry, so that we can capture the things we want to capture. And then once we get that done, then we start to see those benefits really compound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:16):
So going back to that measurement number, what do you recommend? How do people find these numbers? Because I think that's so much of the power of this is like, "We saved a million dollars doing this." What do you look at to figure that out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:46:28):
I think there are a few different things to keep in mind, like who is our key audience, and we usually have a few key audiences. We really want to be able to speak to developers because they're the ones that are going to be using the systems. They'll be partnering with you on either building them or at least providing feedback about what you're doing. So for them, we often want to frame this in terms of things they care about. So time savings. If something gets faster, they can save time. They don't spend time doing setup when they don't need to anymore, related to status reduced toil. So compliance and security are super important. Also, many times it requires several manual steps that... I don't say they're not value add. They're not value add from an individual human perspective. If we can automate as much as possible, that's great, and improved focus time.

(00:47:22):
That's from the developer side of you. Leadership often cares about... They care about those things, but they often care more about other things. So we could talk about usually costs in dollars, "Can we accelerate revenue? What does our time to value look like? What is our velocity? How quickly can we get feedback from customers?" And for folks and organizations that are in really competitive environments, that can be really compelling because it's all about speed. We could talk about saving money. Here, we can look at maybe quantifying savings. One example is test and build. If we can clean up a test and build suite to a developer, they really want to hear about time saved and more reliable systems. There's less toil because they don't have to keep re-running tests or kind of go clean up test suites.

(00:48:13):
From the business perspective, cleaning up a test in a build suite can be cloud cost savings because all of those tests are running somewhere on a cloud. And if they always fail or if it's just kind of a waste of spend, that can be useful, recovering some capacity. We can always talk about time and productivity gains, "How much equivalent developer time are we losing on things that are not necessarily value add?" And then sometimes we can correlate to business outcomes and correlate is usually the best we can do here, but there can be some pretty compelling correlations in terms of speeding up time to value and increase market share, for example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
Let me follow that thread and come back to this, what I think is the biggest question people have right now with AI and productivity, and I don't think anyone has the answer yet, but I'm curious to get your take of just what should people do today? What's the best approach to understanding what impact AI tools are having on their productivity? Because they're spending all this money on there. I don't know, what are we getting out of this? So I guess things are moving faster, but I don't know. So if someone had to just like, "Okay, here's what I should probably try to do," what would be your best advice here for measuring the impact of AI tools on productivity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:49:28):
I would say it depends. In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about. We are usually pretty good at figuring out what matters to developers and we could communicate that to them. But if we're trying to just identify two or three data points to really kind of focus on, because when we're first starting with data, sometimes it can be challenging, what do they care about? Think about the messaging you've been hearing. Have they been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed. Think about ways that you can capture metrics for speed from feature to production or feature to customer or feature to experiment and what that feedback loop looks like if they're talking about profit margin all the time.

(00:50:18):
Now, we always talk about money because this is business. But if that seems to be an overarching narrative, look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost. Or sometimes you'll reinvent, change a process, and then you no longer need as many vendors. So reductions in vendor spent can also help there. I say also it depends because sometimes they'll say something, leadership will say something, and it kind of comes up as a theme. If you could solve a problem that they have or it's something that they're focused on, if you can slightly reframe it even, like if they're calling everything developer productivity, go ahead and call it productivity. If they're calling it velocity, and velocity is what matters to them, think about how to frame this in terms of velocity. If they're talking about transformation or disruption, how does this help with the disruption? Because then, it will resonate with them. We don't want to make them work to understand what it is that we're doing and the value that we provide.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
That is such good advice. Just to reflect back, the advice here is if your company's trying to figure out what sort of impact are AI tools having on our company, first, it's just like, what does the company care about most? What do leaders care about most? Could be market share, could be profit margin, could be velocity. We need higher velocity or we need to transform, transformation. So your advice there is figure that out based on words and phrases you're hearing. Then figure out ways to measure that, ways to measure market share growing, profit margin increasing. I love these examples, like time from feature, idea to production or to experiment, so maybe start tracking that. If it's margin, it's money saved by fewer tests, failing or some vendor you don't have to pay for, things like that. And then velocity, I imagine that's where things like DORA come in of just speed of engineering, shipping, or... What would you think about there for velocity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:52:16):
I would say it's actually one of those... I would pick as broad a swathe as you can. So if you can go from idea to customer or idea to experiment, how long does that take? How long does it typically take, and how long can it take, and does it take now with improved use of AI tooling and reduction in friction? That's where I will say, we talk about this a little bit in the book, how do we deal with attribution challenges? What was responsible for this? Was it the DevEx or was it AI? Go ahead and disclose that. Say, "Yes, we rolled out AI tools. We also had this effort in DevEx. They partnered very closely together." Both of them probably contributed to this, right? If we had AI tools without the DevEx improvements, we probably would've had some improvements, but not nearly as much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):
If people were starting to do this today, say they're just like, "I want to start measuring developer experience," are there a two or three metrics everybody basically needs they should just start measuring ASAP?

Nicole Forsgren (00:53:10):
If you're just starting today and if you have nothing at all, talk to people, obviously. After that, I would do surveys because surveys can give you a nice overall view of the landscape quickly so that you know where the big kind of challenges are. I say that because if you're just starting, you might not have instrumentation through your system, all the metrics. And if you do already, it might not be what you think you want. Metrics that were designed without purpose, questionable. Metrics that were designed for another purpose, they might work for what you want, but they might not, so we can't just assume we have them. That's one reason I like surveys, and we include an example in the book. You can just ask a few questions, "How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?" and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three.

(00:54:12):
Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly? Because sometimes it hits you every single day, and you're just mad about it. Sometimes it only hits you once a quarter because it's end of quarter, but it's so onerous, and then kind of open text, like, "Is there anything else we should know?" That can give you incredible signal because by making folks prioritize the top three things... Let them pick everything, it makes the data super, super messy. But three things and how often, you can just come up with a score or a weighted score if you want, and then go kind of dig into, where should that data be? What data do we need? But also, then you've got at least some kind of baseline. It'll be a subjective baseline, but now you'll know what the biggest challenges are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
I love how all this just comes back just starting by talking to people and asking them these things, which is very similar to product management and just building great products is, have you talked to your customers? Everyone thinks they're doing this, but most people are not doing this enough.

Nicole Forsgren (00:55:17):
And I will say one thing that's challenging when you think about getting data, so interviews are data and that's important, surveys are a little more quantified because we can turn it into counts, but that's where we also want to be careful. A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, "Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?" You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something? So it can be really difficult to untangle what the signal is you're actually getting there, and so it is worth the time chatting with someone who's familiar with survey design, having a conversation with Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT around, "Here are the survey questions. Or can you propose some?" And then make sure you take a couple of rounds. Is this a good survey question? What questions can I answer from the data that I get? What problems could I solve? If you can't answer a question with data, don't get it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
And you have example surveys in your book for folks that want to just copy and paste and not have to think about this much.

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:28):
Yeah, example surveys, a lot of example questions. We even recommend what the format, what the flow should look like, how long it should be, how long it should not be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
One thing that I was reading is that you don't love happiness surveys specifically, asking engineers how happy they are, is that true? If so, why is that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:45):
I don't, no. Well, I'll say I don't love a happiness survey because there are too many things that contribute to happiness. Happiness is a lot, right? So happiness is work, happiness is family, happiness is hobbies, happiness is weekends, happiness... There are so many things that contribute to happiness. Now, that doesn't mean I don't care about happiness. I think happiness surveys are not particularly useful here. What can be helpful is satisfaction and people are like, "That's the same thing." It's not because you can ask, "Are you satisfied with this tool?" and then ask some follow-up questions. Now, those two are related because the more satisfied you are with your job and your tools and the work and your team, it contributes to happiness. I used to joke... Remember the golf commercials like, "Happy cows like happy cheese"?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):
No.

Nicole Forsgren (00:57:35):
I had a Calabrian. That was the best. Happy devs make happy code. They write better programs, they do better work, they're better team members and collaborators. But capturing and trying to directly influence happiness, that's not what we are here for. It's too challenging, it's too all-encompassing. Satisfaction can give us some signal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:59):
In a totally different direction, in terms of just tools you see people using, are there any that just like, "Oh, yeah, this one's really commonly great." For people, this is just a tool people are finding a lot of success with. There's the common ones, Copilot, Cursor. I don't know. Is there anything that stands out that you want to share, just like, "Hey, you should check this tool out. People seem to love it"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:21):
I think they're huge, right? Copilot, Cursor, Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):
Claude Code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:26):
Yep, Claude Code. I love Claude Code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):
I have a whole post coming on ways to use Claude Code for non-engineering use cases.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:35):
Cool. Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
It's so interesting. For example, Claude Code, "Find ways to clean up storage on my laptop," and it just tells you there's a bunch of files. It's just like ChatGPT running on your computer and you could do all kinds of crazy stuff on your computer for you, like a mini God.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:36):
I'm going to do that now. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
It's so good. Yeah, that's why I'm writing this. I had Dan Shipper was on the podcast and he said Claude Code is the most underrated AI tool out there because people don't realize what it's capable of. It's not just for coding, and that's what I'm trying to explore more and more. Okay. Is there anything else that you think would be valuable to help people improve their developer experience, help them adapt to this new world of AI and engineering that we haven't covered?

Nicole Forsgren (00:59:22):
I think something that's important to think about in general is to bring a product mindset to any type of DevEx improvements that are happening, and also the metrics that we collect and capture. By that, I mean we want to identify a problem, make sure we're solving a problem for a set of users. We want to think about creating MVPs and experiments and get fast feedback, do some rapid iteration. We want to have a strategy. We want to know who our addressable market is. We want to know what success is. We want to basically have a go-to-market function. We need to have comms. We need to get continuous feedback from our customers. We want to keep improving. And, at some point, we want to think about sunsetting something. Is it in maintenance mode? Is it sun setting?

(01:00:12):
And I think that's important in general, but I think it's extra important now because when we have AI tools, we're using AI tools, we're embedding AI into our products, things are changing so rapidly that it can be really important to take half a beat and say, "Okay, what's the problem I'm trying to solve right here? Is this metric that we've had for the last 10 years still important or should this be sunset because it's not really important anymore? It's not driving the types of decisions and actions that I need."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Before we get to our exciting lightning round, I want to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. Is there some way that you've found a use for an AI tool in your life, in your work that you think might be fun to share, that you think might be useful to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:00:55):
I have been working on some home design and redecorating rooms and stuff. I'm working with a designer because I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, I'm not good at this. But I've really been loving ChatGPT and Gemini especially to render pictures for me, so I can give it the floor plan, I can give it one shot of the room that's definitely not what it's supposed to look like, and then I can give it pictures of a couple different things, and then I can just tell it change the walls or change the furniture layout or change something. It helps me and it's relatively quick. It helps me kind of visualize the things... Again, I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, so I know if I like it or not, which is probably a very random use, but it's fun for now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
My wife does exactly the same thing. She's sending me constantly, "Here's what this rug will look like in our living room. Here's this water feature." It's so good and it keeps getting better. It's just like, "Wow, that's exactly our house with this new rug," and all you do is just upload these two photos and just like, "Cool. How would this look in our room?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've been impressed a couple times. Definitely the machines are listening to us. It's given me a mock-up of a room or something and then it throws in a dog bed, because I have dogs. I'm like, "I did not tell you to do that, but yeah, that's probably the color and style of dog bed that I should have in this room."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):
Speaking of that, have you tried this use case, ask ChatGPT, "Generate an image of what you think my house looks like based on everything you know about me."

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:22):
I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
Because it has memory and it remembers everything you've talked about, and it's hilarious. You got to do it.

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:29):
Okay, that's on my to-do list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
There we go. Bonus use case. Nicole, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:38):
Awesome. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:43):
Outlive by Peter Attia is fantastic. Another one that's I guess maybe related, I hurt my back so it's not great, Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill is incredible. Shout out to anyone who has hurt lower back. It's for a lay person to read through and figure out how to fix lower back problems. It's kind of a random one. I will say I love How Big Things Get Done. I can't pronounce the names. I think one's... There's Scandinavian, one is. It kind of dissects really large projects through recent-ish history and where they failed and why. And I think it's really interesting for us to think about, especially now in this AI moment where basically all of our at least software systems are going to be changing. So how do we think about approaching what is essentially going to be a very large project? And then, sorry, I'm going to throw in a bonus one, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis. Matt Velloso recommended it to me, and it's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Yes, I read that-

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:44):
I audibly gasped at the last sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
Oh. I was like, "What?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:47):
I was [inaudible 01:03:48]. Yeah, I was not expecting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
I read that and I do not remember that last sentence. Oh, man. Okay, cool. Next question. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you recently watched and enjoyed?

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:57):
I'll say I watch Love Is Blind. If I got to shut down at the end of the day, Love Is Blind is fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):
There's a new season out.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:03):
Yeah, very excited... and Shrinking. Have you seen Shrinking?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
No. I think I started The Therapist and yeah, I gave it a shot.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:12):
Strongly recommend it. It's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
Sweet. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some kitchen gadgets, some clothing.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:21):
Yeah, the Ninja Creami is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Did you say this last time?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:25):
I don't know. I may have. I don't think so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:29):
Somebody said this and I still remember it. It's like-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:30):
It's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
... you make ice cream and stuff with it, right?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:33):
Yeah, and you can basically freeze a protein shake and then it turns it into ice cream-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
Oh, man.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:37):
... which is delicious. Another one is a Jura coffee maker. I'd love good coffee and I'm not great at making it, so I can just push the button and it'll give me anything I want, including lattes, cappuccinos or anything. So that's kind of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
Sweet, okay. Do you have a favorite-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:54):
Just sugar and caffeine. I just need a power through the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
There's the engineering productivity 101.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:01):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):
Oh, man. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or life and come back to in various ways?

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:09):
Yeah, I think one that's come up a couple times, it's not a verbatim thing, I think it's more the vibe, hindsight is 2020, but it's also really dumb. I think if we made the best decision we could at the time with the information that we had available, then it is what it is. If you make a bad decision because you made a bad decision and you knew better, you had the information, not great. I don't think we give ourselves or other people enough grace because we always end up finding more information out later.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Hear, hear. Final question. I was going to ask you something else, but as we are preparing for this, you shared that you have a new role at Google. Maybe just talk about that, what you're up to there, why you joined Google, anything folks should know.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:53):
Sure. I am senior director of developer intelligence and core developer. It's super exciting and super fun because of all of these things we've been talking about. It's focused on Google and all their properties and their underlying infrastructure, how can we improve developer experience, developer productivity, velocity, all of these things we've been talking about and, because kind of the numbers person, how do we want to think about measuring it, how does measurement change, how do feedback loops change, how can we improve the experience throughout and then kind of drive that change through an organization in ways that are meaningful and impactful and faster than they've been before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:33):
Nice job, Google, getting Nicole. What a win. I need to get some more Google stock ASAP. Okay, two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online and find your book online if they want to dig deeper? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Nicole Forsgren (01:06:47):
Online, you can find the book at developerexperiencebook.com, I'm at nicolefv.com, and LinkedIn occasionally. Sometimes it's a mess. I try to wade through all of the noise. I get there to be useful, sign up for the book and the workbooks. The workbooks are free. I'd love to get any kind of feedback on what works, what doesn't. I always love hearing those kind of stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
Nicole, thank you so much for being here.

Nicole Forsgren (01:07:17):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

## Transcript

Nikhyl Singhal (00:00:00):
When I was a kid and I was growing up in the Midwest, entertainment was like going to the dog tracks. The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits. These tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. And what was interesting is the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, they would never run again because there was like, "Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for." So I think this happens a ton, it's like your listeners are spending time focused on like, "Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company." But they don't think about what happens next. What's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you know nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed.

Lenny (00:01:05):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikhyl Singhal. Nikhyl has worked on and led large teams on four different influential consumer products including Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos. Currently, he leads product teams for the Facebook app at Meta, overseeing groups, stories, messaging, and the feed. Before that, he served as chief product officer at Credit Karma and held various leadership roles at Google. Nikhyl has also co-founded three different startups, and as you'll hear in this episode, is extremely passionate about coaching and mentoring, sharing his knowledge through his newsletter and podcast called The Skip.

Lenny (00:01:47):
In our conversation, we cover all aspects of the PM career and what it takes to be successful at every stage of the journey, including the dangers of thinking too short term, the importance of avoiding what he calls ex-growth companies, why you're probably not getting promoted, what to focus on if you're a new manager, the rise of the senior IC path, also why top leaders often have huge development areas they don't know about and how to catch them, and also why people who make it to the top often run into serious mental health challenges. As I say at the end of this episode, this might be my new favorite episode and I'm really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Nikhyl Singhal after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Nikhyl, welcome to the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:04:43):
Thank you, Lenny. I appreciate it. I'm happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:45):
So I have a very simple question to start. How many product managers have you been a mentor to if you had to put a number on it?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:04:53):
Good question. I guess I haven't thought about it from that perspective. I would say hundreds is probably the way to sort of answer the question, and a little bit has to do with whether how we define being a mentor. I know that was supposed to be a simple question and I'm going to give you a complicated answer, but I think that I started out just helping people 10, 15 years ago, trying to help them through their careers. I find the whole area really interesting. And then what happened was just I started to scale because people were always like, "Hey, can you find time?"

Nikhyl Singhal (00:05:22):
So now what I do is I tend to help and coach hundreds of folks through transitions. So if they're in a moment where they're trying to decide between another job, if they're trying to decide to leave, if they're having sort of an alert at work, I call them 911 calls. I take a few 911 calls every week and from a relatively large group of people. So I find those are the most substantive times to help people, is when they're in moments of dilemma or forks in the road, and that's why the number is more closer to hundreds.

Lenny (00:05:54):
Okay. Follow-up question: How many of those people you've mentored have been on this podcast?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:05:58):
Probably half dozen to kind of close to a dozen at this point.

Lenny (00:06:02):
Oh, wow.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:03):
Yeah, easily half dozen.

Lenny (00:06:06):
Amazing. Okay. Is there any names you want to name or should we keep it anonymous?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:09):
Yeah. We'll keep it anonymous because I want people to feel they can always call me in and not feel like that. I don't tend to share the names of most people.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Okay. I know the one person that self-identified was Annie Pearl from Calendly, who is a big advocate of the stuff that you do. So we don't want-

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:23):
Yeah. Annie is someone I learned from and helped talk with, and she's also part of a community that I also build on the side where we pulled a bunch of CPOs together and they've been building community. I'm a big fan of community and learning, and she's part of that as well.

Lenny (00:06:39):
Awesome. I definitely want to talk about that, but maybe just set a little context for our conversation. I feel like you're in the very high percentiles of people that have seen a variety of careers in product management, both good careers, bad careers, junior people, senior people. So I want to focus most of our time on talking about just the PM career path and what you've learned about what is important to have a successful, thriving, happy PM career. Does that sound good?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:07:07):
Perfect.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Okay. So I'm thinking we break up the chat into early career, mid-career, and late career. So within the early career section, you've talked about how people often make a mistake in their early career, specifically being very short-term focused in deciding where they're going to go. And that's a very dangerous way of thinking about it. So I'd love to hear just your take on exactly what does that mean, and why is that actually a bad idea?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:07:33):
Yeah. I tend to be long-term focused in most of my counsel, and maybe to give you an example of what a short-term focus career kind of framework looks like is, "I really dislike my boss. I feel like this company doesn't have it anymore. There's just too hard to ship things." Those are all maybe true statements, but they probably exist in many of the jobs that one would consider if they were to move for one to another. Lateral moves are by definition not forward moves. So what I try to tell people to think about is work backwards from your end state.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:08:12):
Almost think of career as a product. So if you're building a good product, you think about, "Well, here's what a great product would look like," and then you break it into version one, version two, version three. Well, in some ways the reason I called my newsletter, my podcast The Skip is because I always think about not the next job, but the one after it. Maybe think about not your boss's job but your boss's boss's job and what do I need to think about to get there. And in many ways you may think, "Well, okay, if I need to found a company one day and that's my job after next," then you want to look at maybe your current job and then maybe the next job in service of that. And that may lead you to saying, "Hey, maybe I need a grit of doubt and maybe I should stay and maybe I should learn how to deal with some of this ambiguity. That's why I want people to be a bit more longer term and not so short-term focused.

Lenny (00:09:07):
What are some other examples of that short-term thinking? You talked about "my manager sucks, things are moving really slowly." What other examples where people maybe like, "Oh, okay, I see, this is actually short term. Let me think longer term"?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:09:17):
I'd say the biggest one in workplace is focusing career and promotion together. I think that there's perhaps a light connection between promotion and career addition, but I feel like too many people are, the moment we talk about career, they're like, "Well, let me talk to you. I want to have a career talk with you." And I said, "Sure, why don't you find some time?" We sit down together and they're like, "Well, what do you think I need to do to get to promotion?" And then I said, "Well, promotion is our system at this company to see you moving forward. And it's pretty clear in terms of levels and what you're doing and what the process is and who makes the decision." And that's pretty short term because you can ask, "Hey, it's two years away, how do I make it 18 months?" It's a classic.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:10:09):
But in reality, if you're thinking career, you're thinking about the sort of long term arc and, as I said, maybe the job after next, and then you need to look at the promotion in service because how many people have you and I talked to who said, "Well then, as soon as I get promoted, I'm going to leave"? So then I'm like, "Well, okay, then what's the promotion in service of?" And you get into that conversation, which tends to be, again, very long-term focused.

Lenny (00:10:36):
This makes me think about this interesting two-sided challenge with thinking about your future career and where you want to go. On the one hand, it's valuable to think about getting more logos in your resume and working at Netflix and Meta and Airbnb and Uber, all these guys, there's power and value to that. On the other hand, you just keep doing that. And then what is your life turning into? You're just chasing more fancy logos and feeling better about better brands and your resume and stuff. This might be too big a question, but just how do you advise people to think about how important it's to get some of these companies in your resume and build that side of it versus just doing things you actually enjoy and having a fulfilling life and doing things that are meaningful to you?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:11:18):
Yeah. I mean I think collecting labels does feel shallow to most builders because if you're a product person, you probably got into the business because you like building stuff. And frankly, not just product people want to do that, a lot of technical people want to just build stuff. And then the question is, is the things that you're working on in service of building? And then when you ask people, "Were you happy?" as they always say, "Well, when I was able to build this thing," and oftentimes they don't care whether it worked or not, which is kind of ironic. So for me, when I see people chasing logos, I think about it as well. I'm actually really a big fan of a diverse set of experiences, that I think learning about pre-product market fit then seeing smoke turn into fire and witnessing and maybe shepherding that and then taking fire and turning it into something great and being an experience set where you can see the movie in these different frames makes you just a better builder.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:12:20):
So you can't really go wrong if you're looking at those experiences. And you're looking at inside the building problems and outside the building problems, those are maybe consumer problems and business-to-business problems. The more diverse career you have, the better builder you are. And that usually comes up being satisfied. But the idea of just doing that because you think it's going to make your chances better for the next job maybe scares me and it feels very much in service of some future dream that is not build oriented. And I think that can be leading to sadness.

Lenny (00:12:54):
I love that advice, and I say this often actually on this podcast, the power of a diversity of experiences for so many reasons. Maybe just to close this loop, would you agree there is a lot of value in having one of these FAANG ish companies on your resume? Like a lot of opportunity gets unlocked if you work at one of these companies that people are like, "Oh wow, okay, this person's interesting." Or not? Or do people maybe overthink that?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:13:17):
Generically, the answer is yes. I think it's especially important for executives. I think that many executives are hired because they are to bring expertise of the next phase of organization to this company. We're growing, we want to go after the next phase. We want someone who's has expertise. The MAGMA or FAANG companies, however you want to describe them, they really have challenges and expertise at how to build things at scale, how to manage millions or billions of users and customers. So the advantage is, to be successful at that is an endorsement. Having said that, those specific companies, experiences can be substituted for other later stage companies, but if you're coming in as an executive to bring someone to the next level and you've never experienced it, it's very difficult thing to get that executive experience and to be like a C-level for that growth company.

Lenny (00:14:26):
To point out, FAANG is no longer accurate because Facebook is now Meta. So MAGMA is the term that you prefer.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:14:33):
I prefer that. I think it unfortunately kicks out Netflix, but it also doesn't pay homage to Adobe and Salesforce and a number of other great companies. So I think-

Lenny (00:14:42):
FAANG doesn't. Okay, I like this. Okay, let's try to make MAGMA the new thing. MAGMA, make that the title of this episode. Just joking.

Lenny (00:14:50):
So the next area I want to touch on is, you wrote this kind of hot take on something you call ex-growth companies and how it's not good to be at an ex-growth company currently. So can you just talk about what is an ex-growth company and then why is that not a good place to be as a product manager for probably any kind of role?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:15:09):
I have a pretty strong opinion on this that I think that for 10 years we created the hypergrowth, blitzscaling type phenomenon, and there was a lot of good reasons for that, some of which were just distribution platforms just got so good. You could take out Facebook ads, you could grow with Google, and you could grow in 18 months that maybe took previous companies 10 years. So I think that the idea was that all of these companies could instantly grow when they found product market fit and that birthed all these unicorns. And then suddenly, 18 months ago, it almost like the music stopped. 0% interest rate went away, and it became a lot harder to find growth through just fueling it with capital. And I think that the sudden change meant that not only capital was harder to raise, but companies started to focus on their core products. You've talked about it on this podcast, just how many layoffs and restructuring and managers moving to ICs, and all of that work is happening.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:16:16):
Well, the one funny pocket was there's these large number of growth companies who have raised substantive dollars. So they're not going to run out of capital in 2022 or 2023. What's going to happen is, they actually have quite long periods of time, so you don't see them raising new rounds, you don't see them laying off, but in some ways they're still hiring or they're still seeking the next product. The sad truth is that many of their contemporary companies that went public are worth 10% or less than what they were worth back then, and these companies are privately held and so they're sort of sleeping in the shadows.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:17:07):
My fear is, from a career point of view, so many tech professionals are in these organizations or joining these organizations with the expectation that they'll make money on their equity, that they'll continue to do fine. And my sense is we're going to see, even in the second half of this year, lots of boards pulling back, taking their capital back, companies essentially saying, "Hey, we're capitalized. We're a scaled ocean liner, and now we need to go find product market fit." But doing that with 300 people and expectations of hitting a multi-billion dollar valuation just isn't going to happen. So that's the reason why I'm like, "Danger. This is not the company to join, this is the company to leave. Find another phase. Time's a wasting." And I worry very much that people aren't getting the message.

Lenny (00:18:00):
I know you probably don't want to name any names of companies, but what are some signs that may be you're at one of these companies?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:18:07):
I think that the moment that you are reframing the core product, trying to find that product market implies that this company's valuation needs to be a pre-product market fit valuation. So the two questions you ask yourself the day after we listen to this podcast is, "Hey, are we scaling a product? We have customers that love us and we have a tremendous sucking sound? Or are we trying to find that customer sucking sound?" And if the answer is, "We're still trying to find it," and then you're like, "Is your evaluation hundreds of millions or tens of millions?" and if the answer is hundreds or more and you're still trying to find that sucking sound, you're an ex-growth company.

Lenny (00:18:57):
As a founder listening to this, I bet you're like, "Damn, we don't want people leaving. This isn't the kind of message we want to hear." On the other hand, as an employee at a company, that is your advice, just generally recognize it and then you should probably leave as soon as possible because things are not going to work out for you.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:19:15):
As an employee, I think you have almost no recourse because you almost have to start over in terms of it's a new four-year investment. I think that as a founder, you can recap your company. You can reset your stock price, you could reissue. You can make those hard decisions and you can maybe return some of the money to the board and still continue, or you can pull the plug and restart the company that maybe you really wanted to. But I think the founder is in a better position, but they also have a lot more to lose and far more constraints. But employees, they're not... If you listen to this and come to this conclusion, a lot of times, the listeners here, half or more of their compensation is an equity and we just concluded that most of their equity may not be worth anything. In which case, are you willing to take a half pay cut or work for 20% of what you can get on the market? My question is, that seems to be quite concerning, the opportunity cost is just too rich.

Lenny (00:20:19):
An important variable in this framework/piece of advice is product market fit. This might be too big of a question, but just, what tells you that something might have not have product market fit when you're at a company like this? What are signs to you and smoke signals of like, "They may not have product market fit"?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:20:36):
For me, it's always around this pull that sort of how much work do you have to do to basically generate pull? So right now with OpenAI for example, we're seeing ridiculous pull, but we may not be seeing, for example, massive revenue or profitability. So that's the reason why I tend to feel like you can kind of tell by how hard it is to acquire your users. When companies are putting very little in marketing and there're people coming into the door or there's such an easy sale, you've got it. I think that this sucking pull kind of concept feels like the most appropriate way to define it as opposed to the sort of unit economics of acquisition and time to pay back. There are lots of mathy ways to do it, but early on you can tell how hard are you working to bring people in the door.

Lenny (00:21:32):
Is there any reason to consider staying at a company like this?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:21:35):
There are counter examples. I think the counterpoint is, this is the biggest role that you feel like you could get and you have an appetite to sort of learn like, "I'm on the executive team, I'm not going to get that somewhere else. That experience is career additive. I want that moment." Great. Sometimes I see loyalty come in, "This was my baby. I feel a commitment to the team, the team that I've made, et cetera."

Lenny (00:22:07):
Yeah.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:22:08):
I actually respect that. I think that you have to put bounds on that. I think that you should have that conversation. But the learning position, the loyalty tend to be the primary reasons to maybe delay the decision, but fear of finding another job is a bad reason, but is an often common reason as well.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Now that we've given many listeners an existential crisis, let me move on to another question within the early career phase and then I'm going to move on to mid-career. I guess the question is just, is there any other piece of advice, wisdom for early PMs? Maybe the question is, what do you think they should most get right in their early career?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:22:56):
There's probably two answers that I would share. One is, they want to build something that they as much as possible are world-class in. So if you think about the different types of product ambiguities that exist in industry, you can be a great crafter. You could be incredibly strong at market ambiguity. You could understand how to navigate markets and create something new that doesn't exist. You can be great at organizational ambiguity. I know how to take complex teams that have complex goals and solve an inside the building problem. You can be a domain expert. I'm an ML expert, I'm a really strong hardware PM. You can be a team expert. I just really thrive in managing managers and I just know how to get the balance right. So, being a product manager means you're confronted with maybe all five or maybe more of these. I want to know that you pick up one of these as early as possible.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:24:07):
So maybe you become an expert in domain, maybe you become a great crafter, maybe you really think through how to manage growth. Growth is another one that I would add to the list. But picking a lane is kind of goal number one. And then maybe goal number two is having a story to tell to that next employer and that next, next. What I worry about is, sometimes when I'm in an interview, and you and I have probably done hundreds, and you're talking to someone and then they talk about those early jobs and they just sort of said they were there, this happened and it's very hard to connect, tell me exactly what you learned and what you did, I want to know that story. So it's just like Amazon talks about building the press release before they start creating a product. Think about the story, think about the skill, then solve your day to day, your week to week, your month to month, your performance review. That's my biggest advice I seize.

Lenny (00:25:12):
I love that advice. It connects to your other earlier piece of advice, of just try to get a variety of experiences because that'll help you figure out which of these things is maybe best suited for what you're interested in, what you enjoy doing.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:25:24):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny (00:25:25):
Awesome. So let's transition to mid-career. Let's talk about promotions. You mentioned getting promoted earlier. We chatted a bit about that. There's probably no one ever that didn't want to get promoted. It's a common topic in people's career, but a lot of times people don't understand why they're not getting promoted, they're not sure people are looking for to get promoted. You've promoted a lot of people and you've gone through a lot of promotions. What would be your advice to give people who are trying to get promoted and just haven't been promoted? What would you suggest people in that position generally do?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:25:57):
Yeah, it's a great question. I think that we want to kind of understand why, and oftentimes asking your manager won't reveal the answer. So then you'll start with that. I think that the answer of what you do is correlated with what's the real reason. And I think that there may be, I'll suggest four kind of common things I've seen that really hold people back. And then depending on your environment, you have to decide how many of these apply.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:26:25):
So I think the number one is that you just don't have advocacy. You need someone to see the magic in you to be promoted. There is many of your listeners who have that magic but maybe have a manager or a promotion team, it doesn't always have to be the manager itself, who doesn't see said magic. And in that case, if you have the magic, you're in a bad setting and you just need to change. That could be a shift within the project. You could find a manager who sees it. It could be leaving the company. I think the second that's very common now, Lenny, and I think it's coming up a ton, is the next role doesn't exist.

Lenny (00:27:10):
Mm-hmm.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:27:11):
So this is not as present in hypergrowth because the next role always did exist. There was always growth, there was always hiring, you're always hiring people above you, below you, et cetera. Now, I think there's lots of examples of people who are really qualified and working at the next level, but the job doesn't exist. So you can't really create that job and ask them to be working at that next job if their position is mostly the previous one. Again, I feel like it's not that satisfying because it means you're still being held back, but it's radically different than if you're unqualified. These two are sort of more, the system is not in a position to advocate.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:27:58):
The third is when you are being impatient. And I think the hardest ones that I think I've worked with is, the highest performers have succeeded because they have set their goals to be more aggressive than what was essentially average achievable. By default, we expect you to be two years in this role. They're like, "Great, I'll see you in a year." And then they get frustrated when they can't do that, and leadership takes longer to absorb. It's more soft skills, it's more subtle. Oftentimes it's based on impact, which is a lot of times lagging, and that tends to be frustrating. So if listeners are like, "I know I'm used to being promoted annually and now I'm a leader and I'm not moving as quickly, it's time for me to go," I'm like, well, maybe that's working as intended. So impatience is a number three.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:28:54):
And then the fourth one I think is about 50% of the cases where it's really, there is a development area but it isn't quite connected to the individual. The listener has a development area, it's substantive. The manager is poor at identifying it, perhaps even doesn't see it, but the promotion committee does, the individual refuses to hear it, which is a very common one. Or they hear it and they just don't want to change it. And they don't do it because they're arrogant, they do it because it's like, "This is who I am. You want me to be X and I'm Y, and that's what a Y is and I don't want to be X." This is the hardest one because this is where coaching and development and self-awareness come in.

Lenny (00:29:46):
Amazing. This super resonates. So just to summarize the four reasons you may not be getting promoted: One is, there's no advocate that sees your magic and understands that you're awesome. Two is, there's no actual role that's available and so there's nothing to get promoted to. And that's so true right now, there's just not. Everyone's laying people off, they're getting rid of manager layers. I totally see that all over the place. Three is, you're probably just not being patient. Four, you actually have some work to do and you shouldn't be promoted. Maybe to follow a thread on that first one, if someone doesn't see your magic, I see a lot of people just complaining that like, "Oh, I'm doing so well, I'm so great and nobody understands it. No one gives me credit. No one really appreciates me." I don't know if there is an answer to this, but is there a way to help people see that no, you're actually not doing great versus you are and people just don't see it? What's a sign maybe? Maybe you're not as great as you think you might be.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:30:41):
The cheap answer is you have to get real feedback, not formal feedback. I think that the more scaled the company is, the more they have these systems in place which provide formal feedback. But honestly, we've run experiments where we said let's ignore the formal feedback, let's have a real conversation with my peers on how our teams are doing. The signal that comes out are dramatically different than the formal feedback. So what you're looking for when you feel like you're in this situation where you're not being seen, and it might be because there's a real issue, what you really want to dial into is, "Let me get the ground truth as to what people are thinking," and you have to have very strong listener skills where we all have been in the discussion, where you're giving feedback to someone and the next thing that they tell you is they justify how you're wrong, that you missed this. "Let me tell you about exactly why that situation that you're using wasn't..."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:31:43):
You have to be great at pulling feedback, listening to it. You have to triangulate it from people that don't see you all the time, that do see you all the time, your peers. But you have to create an environment of safety where people feel like there is no worry about retaliation or concern, et cetera. And the more comfortable people are about giving feedback to you and the more you have the skills to pull it and you don't trust formal or you don't trust manager, the better shot you have of truly understanding what that real issue is and solving it.

Lenny (00:32:16):
This reminds me of Jules Walter who's on the podcast. He gave a bunch of advice. I don't know if you saw that. I've had to accept feedback and get people to give you feedback. And one of its pieces of advice is, ask people for real feedback. And no matter how much you're melting inside hearing it, just be like, "Thank you so much for that." Because then, people feel like, "All right, he's listening."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:32:34):
I think Jules is a great, probably one of the world's best people in pulling feedback in my experience. I think that the one that even ones up it is, when I talk to Jules, Jules will look for feedback, then he'll repeat it back to me better than even I presented it. And then I'd say, "Well, let me now feel safer to even provide." Because anyone who's explaining it to a place that they all not only internalize it but they can articulate clearly understands and values it. And that's the really powerful way is, "So what you're saying is I just interrupt far too often and some ways it's almost to a point that it's annoying. Is that a fair assessment?" "Oh, that's actually not the words I use," but that's what really gets people comfortable in sharing with you what's really going on.

Lenny (00:33:24):
Amazing. I think we're discovering some of these people that have worked with you that have been on the podcast slowly. Maybe while we're on this topic, I didn't expect to go here, but in terms of other tips for getting good feedback, is there anything else that just comes top of mind of how to get better feedback from people? Because it's hard to do. Most people talk about getting feedback and then don't, or they just don't know how. So one is just, you said repeat back exactly what they told you and be like very appreciative. Is there anything else?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:33:51):
I'd share out feedback. It's a little easier when you are a manager, but for example, most managers that are listening have a staff discussion. Maybe it's sort of awkward, but maybe you have a standup and you are giving notes to people. So as a manager, someone will come to me and they'll give me a piece of feedback. The next Monday when I have my staff meeting, I'll make a comment about something and I'll say, "Well, lot of this came because I got this great piece of feedback from..." and I'll name the person, and I'm like, "It really helped me see this challenge." Now, that feedback could be about me or about this project or about the team. And it might be positive, it might be constructive. People hear that and they're like, "Wow, I get recognized for giving this guy feedback. Sign me up." You're always trying to find way to break down that barrier.

Lenny (00:34:45):
I love that tip. You talked about managers and how often managers are not great at managers. Maybe they don't identify development areas, maybe they're bad in other areas. So maybe just a question here of just, why are managers often not great? And then two, if you're a new manager, I think a lot of listeners are maybe transitioning to management or about to transition, what's your advice for being successful as a new manager?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:35:12):
I'll start by saying that, in a hundred years when the archeologists look back and they see tech in the sort of early years of tech, the first 34 years, they'll say that the biggest surprise was how much we thought it was okay to not train managers. The military probably didn't make that mistake for very long before they corrected it. And most immature industries really train managers, but boy, if you're a good coder, you are ready to manage. That's the way the industry works. If you can talk, you are ready to product manage. If you can product manage and ship something out the door, you should definitely tell people what to do. I think that there's such a loose coupling between the skills to be successful at building things and teaching people how to build. It's the difference between if you can make a good car, you must know how to make the factory that makes the car. I don't think that's true at all.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:36:18):
I think that this is a massive epidemic, that I think there's the thousand challenges that stem from this, whether it's challenges around bias, challenges around enabling coaching and teaching and solving development areas. My hope is that one day as an industry we find ways to improve and fix it. But podcasts like yours are actually quite meaningful steps. I would say that your podcast might be more meaningful than most L&D departments in most organizations today. So that's powerful because you're having a tremendous amount of impact, and I think learning is essentially a lifelong opportunity and I think that is the type of resources that just didn't exist a decade ago.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:37:03):
I think to answer your question around what are the common pitfalls, if you're a first time manager listening or maybe someone who's considering it, I think there are probably two quick things that I would say you have to get bravely thoughtful about as you enter into this journey. One is, your challenge is going to be to share the steering wheel with the person or the set of people you are managing. And I think that there's this three modes that people have in their head. They're like, "Oh, management is divide and conquering. You go there, I go there, we meet up."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:37:39):
Or they'll say it's like riding a bike, or teaching to ride a bike, I should say. Someone starts out on the bicycle, I hold your hand, I let go, and then I hope that you fly. I think it's more like the sidecar on the motorcycle, where person's driving the motorcycle and I'm on the sidecar and whether I like it or not, I'm attached, but I have this relatively specific role of giving counsel. I think that that model of how do you share the steering wheel, not just say you got it or I got it or I got it for a while, and then I hand it to you is the key question.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:38:15):
And then I think that the second miss that people tend to have is they tend to, because they have power, by the way, organizational power, not because they've earned that power, they start managing whatever they define that to be. And what I find is that you're more like the vampire knocking on the door of someone. You have to be invited in. You just can't walk through the threshold. And I think that no matter how senior the person that is the manager, you have to earn the right to be the person's manager. So maybe to be specific, well, if I start managing someone, the thing I'd like to understand is like, "Hey, well, what can I help you with?" And they can invite me in. Oftentimes, the answer is, "I don't need you. I actually wasn't excited about you as a manager. I don't need another layer between you and the CEO. Get out." And I'm like, "That's cool," because anything I say after that is just going to be annoying and it's going to backfire.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:39:20):
Now, one day they will need help, and I will be in the sidecar waiting to say, "Perhaps I can assist." And then when you finally get to that moment where you're invited in, you pick an area or two, and then you really partner with that person on that area. I can give examples on that, but I generally think that it's this invitation picking specific and then making sure we're sharing the responsibility is the key set of notes that I would share with you.

Lenny (00:39:51):
What's your take on the IC path, senior IC path, something that a lot of companies talk about? I know Meta is big on this right now, the layering managers and things like that. I find a lot of times there's a lot of talk about it and there's not really a real career opportunity there. I guess, what's your just take on as that is a real option for most people trying to basically avoid the manager out and staying in IC, PM long term?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:40:17):
Yeah, I think that it's a little bit more acute now because of the backlash that we talked about between growth where management was perceived. So in this case, management was perceived as a way to drive expansion. So if you're in charge of expansion, you're managing the people that are doing the build and now we're doing a lot fewer things. So I think that's what's mandated this sort of growth in the IC track, for lack of a better term. I think it is one of the best things that happened to our industry because what's happened is, in the last 10 years, and you can tell I'm particularly hard on our managers here, they've basically been promising ICs that early promoted into management. They didn't get taught, and now they're sort of average managers and promising ICs. But now the story that they tell and what they've built is not awesome.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:41:22):
If I'm looking to hire, if I'm in a growth company and I'm the next hottest thing and I'm looking to hire someone and someone walks into the interview and said, "Look, I've managed two people before and then I was in the charge of this thing, but they really did the details. And then by the way before that, I was early in trying to get this thing out the door and then they picked me to be manager," I'm like, "Okay, that's an interesting set of experiences. I'm looking, for me, in my company to build something."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:41:47):
The next person walks in, it's like, "I've been an IC for that whole time. And during that time I went from learning something to demonstrating it to really being able to take it forward. And I got one of these ambiguities master. I'm an expert in domain. I'm an expert in managing organizations," I'm like, "I don't need a team ambiguous expert. That's not my hard part. My hard part is actually cracking the code on this complex market or this very complicated organization where we have two teams that have different goals. You're the type of person I want."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:42:19):
So I think Lenny, to your question, I think the IC track is one of the best things that's going to happen for people career. But to your point, those tracks, from a promotion and from a industry, how we perceive it, they're not in cement yet. They're tender. You wait six months, you wait nine months, they'll become very, very strong and solid. And I think then, we'll be able to lean very hard into them as a real promising crack for builders.

Lenny (00:42:54):
Your sense is, this is going to become more and more real as these layoffs have happened and kind of pullbacks on growth have happened.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:43:00):
Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, it's the reality in engineering and design. So in engineering, you can be the sort of VP of engineering or CTO, and in a design, a lot of designers become design managers, a lot of them stay as crafters. And then for whatever reason in product managers, maybe because they were managers in our title, we just all became managers. What about the product? What about the other side? So I actually think it's a bug that has existed for a long time that actually we're going to correct permanently now.

Lenny (00:43:33):
I wonder if part of it for PMs is, once you become a manager, this happens to me, I didn't want to be an IC anymore. It's like, "I'm done with that. I really enjoy this management layer." And I imagine with engineers, maybe they'll enjoy the coding. When I was an engineer I was like, "Oh, I don't want to just sit around and manage. I just want to code." So I wonder if there's any part of that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:43:52):
But a lot of your listeners like to build. And actually, when they talk to their managers, they're like, "I don't know if that job is awesome. It feels like you spend all your time writing docs and telling your boss's boss what to justify resources and headcount. I just want to build stuff. You don't build stuff." So I think there might be some of that. I think that it's not perfect, but I think hopefully builder and IC will become more synonymous.

Lenny (00:44:19):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

Lenny (00:44:46):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic, click-through metrics and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's get eppo.com. And 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:45:27):
Coming back to the manager life and how many managers are not great and also just how do you get better as a manager, what have you found actually is effective in helping new managers become better?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:45:37):
I think I may have come across kind of hard on managers and I think I kind of said, "Hey, your manager and your manager's manager isn't really doing much teaching. Find the right podcast, good luck." And I think that that's a pretty soulless answer. So maybe the way I describe it is, well, I think learning is changing, and there's the self-service tools that are getting better and then there's the structured teaching which I think is weak. And then there's community, which I think whether it's within your company or outside of company, I think is the answer that we'll see more and more. I think community as a way of creating safety, having authentic conversations, feeling that you're not alone, that others are going through the same thing, and then sharing best practices is so powerful. And what social software has done is it has really empowered community.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:46:46):
And now the tools are awesome. How many great communities have Slack channels or Discord channels or Zoom calls? And we do a lot of that in the CPO community that I created. Whether you're a new manager or whether you belong to a diverse group, whether you are new to a company, I think that all of your listeners should be part of an active community where they can be very authentic and very safe. Sometimes it's hard to do that with your coworkers, and so you need to find another community. Unfortunately, those communities are not the easiest to find today, but I believe that the notion of community as a powerful propellant for learning is the critical ingredient and hopefully many people are creating these communities so that new managers can find the right services.

Lenny (00:47:40):
Can you actually talk about this community that you've built? This could be a good time to talk about it. It's called The Skip. Is that right?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:47:45):
Yeah. It's funny, it's all kind of fun products. They were always a reaction to something. They weren't really intentional. I, as you opened the podcast, did really enjoy teaching and coaching. I learned just as much from coaching others as they learned, I think. And yet I couldn't really scale. So I had this summer where I had just come off of being a head of product, and more and more of my people I was talking to were also head of products. What would happen is, I would have these conversations and they would ask me a question. I would say, "Well, that's the same conversation I answered on Tuesday." What you realize is, it's a very lonely job. Being lonely at the top is not just an adage. Really, everyone's so busy now. It's like, how do you have time to connect? Everything's a single player, you don't really have community.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:48:39):
So I thought, "Well, what if I took the half a dozen people I talked to this month?" And I just said, "Hey, all of you are all interested in talking through how to navigate this crazy world of year one, year two, chief product officer. I think you would really gain. I know all of you and I think you can be safe with one another. Why don't we spend some time together?" So we did a WhatsApp channel and we brought a Zoom call. This was during the pandemic, so you really couldn't meet up. And we started talking. We started talking every month, and people were so empowered by the fact that the problem they were hitting was not just them. It was, "My crazy CEO is telling me this." And the next person is like, "Oh yeah? Let me tell you what my person said." And then they would say, "Oh my gosh, that sounds worse than my situation."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:49:33):
But then, we would sit down and say, "Hey, the third person said I actually kind of had this and now I figured out a way out, and here's what I did." And you're like, "Wow, that's amazing. I'm going to try it." The next day they come back, they're like, "It works." And we started to connect and we built this trust, and community building is interesting and powerful work. So six went to 12, and then 12 went to 15, and now we have 28 members. A lot of folks are interested in these types of communities, but I'm so worried about scaling it because it's the enemy of trust and authenticity. So for all of you that are building communities, it's like tree balancing act. But I do think that the goal is to find ways to take all of this sort of like-minded folks that are in these same situations and connect them together. Late stage chief product officer happened to be one of the ones that had some of the most substantial importance to me because of all the coaching I did for that group.

Lenny (00:50:35):
If someone's listening and they're like, "Oh, I need to join this thing," how do they find out about it? How do they potentially apply and try to join?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:50:41):
Well, we have enough members now. There's a LinkedIn area called The Skip CPO Community, and you should contact any of the members that you know and ask them to join. My request and my requirement is that they are, number one, product leaders in their organization and a company that's not early, but that's mid to late. And the reason being is, those sets of problems tend to be the most similar. To be honest, I think this is not the only community that I want to be part of and help create, but this one happens to be the preexisting one. I think there are lots of powerful communities that can be created, but this particular one is very much focused on The Skip CPOs.

Lenny (00:51:28):
Awesome. I'll mention the community around my newsletter just so folks are looking for a community join. I try not to promote these sorts of things, but it's a good time, may as well. If you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, there's a Slack community you get access to. There's about 12, 13,000 people in there. There's meetups happening all over the world every month. It's amazing. Very proud of it. People are getting a lot of value of it, and it's basically open to any level of product manager. Other functions are in there too. So it's a very different sort of experience, but willing to add that also in the show notes if you want to check that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:51:59):
I think that that would be my put, because so many of the managers will say, "Hey, I'm an IC," here's a greater one, "I am not being told I have the next job. I just was told to become an IC and I was a manager. I feel like my learning opportunities are stuck, but this is a bad time to look for a job." They should be in your community. They will learn more from that community than they will learn from managing one random person that they were attached to managing in some project that may or may not see the light of day, yet that's how our society is programmed. Our industry is like, "No, no, go manage that person because that's going to make you closer to the top. Forget learning." And I'm like, "Well, learning isn't happening. Learning's happening in your community. Learning is happening in our communities in general." That's why I'm pushing so hard on this.

Lenny (00:52:54):
This is a good segue to talking about the third bucket, which is kind of later career CPOs. That's the segue in my mind there. Something that I've heard you talk about is that a lot of really senior leaders have real development areas, but they're hiding behind these superpowers that they have. Plus, people don't like to give real feedback to senior people. So I'd love to hear just what you're seeing there and how maybe people can work through that and what we can learn about that issue that you've noticed.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:53:27):
This came from my notes as I was talking to a therapist on this. They talked about the shadows of superpowers. And I thought it was an incredibly powerful phrase that everyone focuses on your superpowers, but no one ever thinks about what shadows they create. Shadows of superpowers to me is the story of a lot of executives. There's an adage that's thrown around, which is, what gets you there isn't what got you here. It's sort of the tools that have made you successful today, you need to almost rebuild or relearn to get to the next phase. And I think both of these sort of speak to the same point, that oftentimes people have a great superpower. They go into a performance review, person says, "You're getting some feedback from your peers that you struggle in collaboration." And the manager even sometimes is puzzled, but the individual will say, "Are you kidding me? My last five performance reviews told me that I was one of the best collaborators in the company. How in the world is that possible?"

Nikhyl Singhal (00:54:42):
And then what you realize is that, "Well, you're collaborating as long as people agreed with your point of view. Now as a leader, we're asking you to be opinionated, and because you just think you're an amazing collaborator using the exact same tool set. And it turns out that when you're dealing with senior people, that may not even be in your function, they may not be product, they may not be tech, they recoil, but you're moving so fast because it's your superpower. You would never think that this needs to be rebuilt." Sometimes it could be more extreme. Great collaborators sometimes are very reticent to present their own opinions because they're so good at assimilating others. Or people that are amazing at growth struggle to be innovative. People that are world-class storytellers struggle to get in the details. People that are very taste maker, they are always the first to have point of view. They don't necessarily introduce change particularly often. You're strong politically, but your decisions are unprincipled. You're a structured thinker, but blue-sky innovations are very tough. You're an amazing listener, but you're very weak to be decisive. I can go on forever.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:56:10):
And what I would say to you is, sometimes even in a 30-minute conversation, walking into the room, just knowing what I know about the person, I can unlock their development area faster than anyone ever before, simply because my secret is, I'll bet you, because of this person's world-class here, these are the three things they're going to hit. And they don't even realize it because it's their identity. This is what got me here. If you make me work on that, you will make me change my superpower. And I'm like, "That's why you're stuck. That's why your career is plateauing." And then they get sad and then they take a long time to process, and then the work actually begins and then they solve and they go. Almost everyone, once they have the name and the face, they're able to solve. But facing the name is hard when it's sitting in the shadows of superpowers.

Lenny (00:57:08):
Wow. That is an incredibly important point. For someone to recognize this, do you find that they need someone like you that's like a coach, mentor, person to come in, and be like, "Here's what I see"? Or is there a way, I guess, as someone that's a peer or an employee to help them recognize this without them shutting down and being like, "No, shut up. No problem'?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:57:28):
No, you don't need a coach. What you do need is to listen to contradictory feedback. So what was the premise here is you're being told that something that you hold as your strength is actually in your way or a development area. Do not dismiss that. Recognize most likely you're doing it correctly. You just have gotten to the next level. So what I'm hoping the listener does is it goes back through all the feedback that they may even have and then looks at all the discard stuff. What's on the discard pile? Things that were discarded are anomalies because they're artifacts of my strength. And often, your managers are the ones that do the discarding, "Oh, that was just a weird... That person, they were just into it. They have it out for you. They got reorged or they were upset." I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Perception's reality. Talk to me about that one. That might be it." That's what I'm looking for.

Lenny (00:58:29):
Fascinating. This makes me think about companies that have the same issue, companies strengths, like say Meta for example, move fast and break things and then, "Oh, that ends up being the biggest Achilles' heel." Uber, similar. Airbnb has similar challenges like that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:58:43):
Absolutely. This exact thing applies to relationships. This applies to companies, this applies to a lot. And I'm so happy that I was able to learn about it. Frankly, it was a critical unlock for me because I was stuck on something for years and I just could not understand how, for me, it was, I was very opinionated about something. And then I realized being loosely held on my opinions didn't mean that I became a weaker executive, but it was my opinions that got me to be so successful and it required me to rewire who I was as an executive. And that took a lot of time and a lot of energy. But it came from this realization and then I started to apply it for other strength areas. And now, every time I have a strength area of myself for those that I coach, I immediately talk through all the things that I bet you exist and most of the time were right.

Lenny (00:59:46):
So what is it for you that you said was your superpower and your shadow?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:59:50):
I think that I was, as an entrepreneur, very opinionated about using small amounts of information to make decisions. And then I was very good at driving those things. So when you become an entrepreneur, you're great at grit, you're great at opinion, you're great at being decisive. And then as an executive, you spend a lot of time making sure everyone has context, everyone is heard, your opinions are actually edited for good reason. And it's not just to placate, it's actually to improve. But as someone who's basically been right a lot, that requires almost a complete and you're like, "Well, that's not who I am." And I'm like, "Okay, you start with the sentence like that's not who I am." You're definitely doing it right when you hit your leadership.

Lenny (01:00:40):
What was the process like for you to work through that? You said it took a long time. What made it effective for you? Was there a coach involved? Something else?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:00:49):
I got a lot of setback. I get a lot of negative feedback. I had a lot of abrupt challenges at work where folks would say, "You're not collaborating well. Your peers don't have the same level of respect as they should." And I was like, "Are you kidding me? That's not who I am. These things that are being said about are completely ironic." I was very much struggling and that's when I said, "You know what? I can struggle and blame others, but what if they were right? I'm going to be doing this for 30 more years, it's kind of worth it to figure out if they're right. If they're wrong, then you don't lose." And that's what kind of forced it. And then the tooling starts, then you start talking through. My self-awareness was strong enough that I was able to say, "Okay, now I understand it." I had some peer feedback that helped bring it home from someone I trusted. So that was a kind of linchpin to this, but these are tough, tough things to break through. And oftentimes they don't come nicely, I guess, is the point.

Lenny (01:01:53):
I was going to ask what that turning point for you was, and it sounds like it was direct feedback from someone you really trusted that's like, "Oh, I really need to take this seriously."

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:01):
You got it. You got it. Because I had a lot of feedback that I was dismissing and then I had feedback from someone, I'm like, "That person I should listen to because they're giving me the feedback for the right reasons and they have the right language."

Lenny (01:02:13):
Comes back to the power of getting feedback and getting good at that.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:17):
And making people feel safe and giving it.

Lenny (01:02:19):
Mm-hmm. That's a good segue to maybe the last question. You told me once that a lot of the people that you work with that have kind of made it have a lot of mental health challenges, that they didn't expect their life to be the way it is necessarily when they got there. Can you just talk about what you see there in that group?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:39):
Yeah. This is a story that I don't think is told very well right now, and partly because it's such a luxury problem, it's almost a little embarrassing to discuss it openly as so many people struggle with so many basic needs, going through layoffs, going through all these challenges. I mean, these are real issues. But I think that what I've noticed is that if you kind of break career as we've done in this podcast between sort of act one, act two and act three, if act one is sort of learning and being that sort of builder and then maybe building the car, and then act two is building the factory, act three is like, what's after that? What do you do after that? And I think that act three in the past wasn't as long as it is now. Before, people would proverbially retire in their 60s when they used to actually physically work.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:03:35):
Now almost all your listeners sit at a desk all day, so they don't need to retire by any means. And health is getting better. You might see folks work until their 70s or 80s. So that means that their careers are potentially 60 years long. So even if you're 20 years or 30 years in your career, you're only halfway through. So this act three could be a thing. And I don't think we talk about act three enough. What often happens is, and this is what I've been watching for people that are at my age, is they sort of succeed and then they become lost. They almost goes hand in hand.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:04:14):
So when I was a kid and I was growing up in the Midwest, entertainment was going to the dog tracks, and not even the horse tracks, we didn't have horses. So it was the greyhound dog tracks. So people would bet on a dog and greyhound would go around the ring and then you would see. I bet on number three and I'll make a buck or something. The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits, which sounds kind of cruel and horrible, so I don't want the SPCA to come after you. But the point is that they'd have these fake rabbits. And what was interesting is, the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, the sort of the tail because the machine broke, because these tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. Sometimes the machines would break, the dogs would actually catch the rabbit, they would never run again.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:05:17):
The reason why they wouldn't run again is because there was like, "Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for." So I think this happens a ton. It's like, your listeners are spending time focused on like, "Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company." But they don't think about what happens next, and when it happens, when they succeed, their North Star, their entire way of wiring their career, themselves, it has been around getting to that place. And I think that if you're going to get there 30 years in and you have a 60-year career, a lot of the discussion I've been having with myself and with others has been, you probably need to start working on that North Star now.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:06:08):
What's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you had no nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder, or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed, or you'll spend money in an attempt to earn more, or you'll find habits that are bad. And I really want us to have long 60-year, 70-year careers, not just 30-year or 10-year, which is why I enter this into the vocabulary out there.

Lenny (01:06:51):
That is really resonating with me. I had a similar experience. I had a startup, and my whole goal was just like, "I just want to start a company." That's my goal. That's all I got in life. I want to start a company and then maybe sell it, maybe go somewhere with it. So I did and then we sold it to Airbnb and then I got to Airbnb and I was just like, "What the hell do I do now? I don't have any other goals." And it was pretty sad. Exactly how you're describing. It was just like, "I guess I'll just work here and I don't know, maybe I'll start another company, but I already did the thing I wanted to do."

Nikhyl Singhal (01:07:21):
Your story is I think very inspiring because what you did is you said, "I think the thing that I want to do is give, but I want to do it in my own way and I want to create something, but I want to do something that I think I can do for 30 years and I want to do it." It has lots and lots of spokes to it. So you reinvented yourself professionally, but you created a new North Star.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:07:48):
My sense is, for every one of you, Lenny, there's a hundred that could do that, that could do giving, that could do things that could scale, but that end up falling into what got them to be successful in act two and they get stuck. So this is the reason why when you hit your skip, keep looking for the next skip, is the point I'm trying to make. And I think you're an inspiration for a lot of folks who have seen you transition and realizes life after just being a tech professional entrepreneur, there's got to be ways to do more of this for all of your listeners. And I think it's never too early to start thinking through. It's actually quite powering to think that you have such a long career. You can make mistakes and you can do some amazing things down the road.

Lenny (01:08:34):
Yeah. This is my fourth career, is what I realized. I was a engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, and now whatever this is.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:08:43):
Whatever this is.

Lenny (01:08:45):
Whatever this is. I guess, just to give people something inspiring, productive, what are maybe some examples of North Stars you've seen that people can evolve into? I guess one path is this path of content creation, helping people learn stuff. What else have you seen that might work out for people?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:09:00):
I think that all variations here come into two categories. One categories are ways to drive more scaled economics. I've made millions. My North Star is to now make it tens. I've made tens. My North star is to do hundreds. That's what drives people from, it's not entrepreneurship, it's investing; it's not investing, it's private equity, et cetera. Whether we describe that as a bad quest or a good quest is a decision for your listener. The other arc is around giving. Eastern philosophies that have been around for thousands of years talk about this as the sort of end state of happiness. I think that maybe to be provocative, I think that it's okay for you in act one and act two to not predicate yourself around the notion of giving to others because this is maybe the time on the planet where you need to take and you need to create.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:10:11):
But boy, if you're going to work on an act three and you have 30 years, regardless of where you are economically, if you feel like you can take that off the table, if you can find ways to give, whatever that means to you, however that translates to you, is that content, is that volunteer, is that starting a company that is more mission based, that is not my role, but I think that if you are able to do that for 30 years and be giving, not only is that going to be more fulfilling than your act one and act two, but it's tremendous for society, very empowering. And that's where I commend you because you're giving through your passion but also making a livelihood. And I think that that's a very powerful blend that is hard to achieve in act one and act two given constraints. And that's the liberation that act three provides.

Lenny (01:11:08):
What do you think your act three plus ends up being?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:11:12):
Many have asked me about this. I would say that I'll use the word, and then I'll tell you I won't use that word. So it is around my passion around coaching and giving to others. But because I'm a product person, because I've seen success in building products, thinking about scale, thinking about community, I definitively plan to devote my act three towards coaching and giving to others and lifting up those that with the right advice at the right time can change their trajectory. But scaling that and doing that in a way that is very authentic is really the hardest part and it's product problem. So that's what I'll devote 30 years to and I look forward to that every day.

Lenny (01:11:59):
That is beautiful. That feels like an exactly correct fit for you, and I'm here to help you on that journey any way I can.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:05):
Thank you, my friend.

Lenny (01:12:06):
Absolutely. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:11):
No, I just appreciate your genuine offer to have me attend and participate in this wonderful podcast that you created.

Lenny (01:12:18):
It's absolutely my pleasure. And it's not over yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:25):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:12:26):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:30):
So two, and both business books. Sorry, I'm going to come across boring. But one is this sort of little bit of an old school book called Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. I don't know if other speakers have spoken about this, but it's a book that Geoffrey Moore wrote, and it's a book that really talks about how to get your first product on base. So it's this concept of creating a beachhead. I like that concept. Marketing is something that we don't talk about in enough and product.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:13:02):
And then the second one is a book that none of your listeners have actually probably heard of called Leadership and Self-Deception. It's a six-hour audio that I highly recommend. It's a story about a person who has hit a wall and who's getting all this feedback that they don't know what to make of, and it's around their mindset being stuck in a box. That was very powerful when I listened to it in my late 20s. So I encourage all of your listeners to grab that one. It's not one that anyone normally would hit, but it's a fun story. It's a good ride, and I think maybe you'll get something out of it.

Lenny (01:13:41):
I have not heard of that second one. I'm excited to check it out. I have Crossing the Chasm back behind me on that shelf somewhere. And you talk about how marketing isn't something product leaders and managers think about enough, and I have many marketing-oriented guests on this podcast and those episodes do the least well, but I'm just going to keep doing it because I totally agree with you. I think there's so much to learn from marketing. It's connected to growth, which is connected to product. So I agree.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:14:07):
Yeah, and I think that marketing is a language of connecting products with people. That is what a product manager does, but we often lack the language. We lack the thinking around how to explain it, and yet we spend all our time on data and features for that. The diversity of having both playbooks can make one of just a much more powerful builder. So I agree with you. Marketing folks is probably some of the best content and the least listen to. So maybe that's a plug for people to go back to those episodes.

Lenny (01:14:39):
100%. That's what everyone should do. I don't know if you know this, but actually, at Airbnb, the product manager function has been renamed to product marketing. So all the product managers are product marketers because Brian is so big on, you're not just building product, your job is also to make sure people use it. We'll see how that experiment goes, but that's a bold move I thought.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:14:59):
Very much so. Very much. But it's an homage to this concept.

Lenny (01:15:02):
Exactly. Okay, back to landing ground. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:15:08):
I'm a huge sports fan, so I have tickets to the Warriors and 49ers, and I am a big Bay Area sports fan. Giannis is my son's favorite player. He's a basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks, and they have this Disney+ story called the Rise story, and it's a story about his childhood and how he struggled to find notoriety and how he made it into the professional leagues. It's a great Disney+ family show and it's a great kind of zero to hero type thing. So I love that story.

Lenny (01:15:41):
I feel like you're going to have a really good answer to this next one. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:15:47):
I like the format of, what's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate? Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career, what's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you can do that for what do people think about AI, that's inaccurate, that everyone believes you could do that for domains, you can do all kinds of things.

Lenny (01:16:18):
I love it. Is there something you specifically look for there, or is it just depends on what you hear?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:16:25):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. And as a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss because they weren't genuine. There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated because it starts with, "What is the thing that you think I want to say here? And then tell me why it's inaccurate." So when I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new, but I don't want the interview process to penalize them. And this was my save question, but I can't use it now that I've told everyone.

Lenny (01:17:27):
It's going to be all over TikTok soon. Everyone's going to know this. Next question, what's a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:17:35):
The geeky answer in me is the Arc Browser, which I think probably a lot of folks are starting to use and your listeners. Part of the reason is, I think it's just great for folks that have hundreds of tabs, and if you work at a scaled organization, you just have lots of tabs. But I think it's also, as a product guy, I thought Chrome was pretty good. They've got gajillions of people using it and billions of installs. So at some point, you kind of come to the conclusion that this is probably good enough. And then you see a product obviously built with a much smaller team and you're like, "Huh, there actually is opportunities to innovate." And any time you see a innovation on something that's mature, as a product person, I think that's just fascinating. And I was just blown away at how they created something that's better than something I hold as a true set.

Lenny (01:18:33):
Yeah. We had Josh on the podcast, we talked about a lot of their philosophies. And on the tab thing, I think the key there is it closes your tabs after 24 hours unless you put them in a specific place, which I love because I was like, you think you would do that, but you don't. And then it's broke so beautiful, you wake up in the morning, everything's gone, but you can save stuff that you want. The other thing I'll mention with Arc, by the way, also huge fan, that's all I use, and I'm not an investor, just a fan, is the onboarding experience is the best onboarding experience I've seen. I was just like, I did it and I got a tweet about this. This is so good. And actually, if you go to that episode, there's a link to get past the wait list and just-

Nikhyl Singhal (01:19:11):
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:12):
Yeah. You gave me many thousands of invites. Okay, keep going. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you develop products and your team that's had a big impact on the team's ability to execute?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:19:26):
A little bit of this is just because of scale, but oftentimes we think a lot about the products and the features and the decisions that we're working on, and then we think that meetings are a nuisance or a must-have necessary evil to be able to deliver. Sometimes I realize that at a scaled organization, the meeting operating system is as important as the products that we're building because it sort of speaks to how we scale and how we ensure we have the right degree of delegation, the right conversations, and then the right acceleration on the right decisions.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:20:11):
So what's interesting is every quarter, in my current teams, even in my past teams, I talk about our meetings like a product. We're on version seven in my team, and so we're like, "Hey, version seven, every 90 days, these are the meetings, these are the discussions, this is how we organize, these are the attendees, and then here's how we make decisions. This is the cadence of the week. This is when people can work from home, hybrid, whatever it might be." And then I take feedback two months in and then every three months we make another route.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:20:44):
What it finds is that people then can plan and they can make meeting time effective. And meeting time is such precious time. It's the most expensive time in a company. So when I was in a startup, I couldn't imagine doing this, but now this is like my bread and butter as a leader. It's the process part. And frankly, for new folks that are new in leadership positions in a new company, it's the one thing you can do when you have low context. When you don't know how the product works, you can look at things with fresh eyes and see inefficiencies when everyone that's been in the system can't see it. I'm a huge fan of rebooting meetings first. So process first, then people, then product, then strategy is sort of the notion I make, and this is this first thing I always do.

Lenny (01:21:29):
Final question, what is one thing every PM listening should do to help their career?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:21:35):
Ensure that the story you will tell about the work you're doing today is meaningful for your skip job. So if you sit down and you write down, "In six months, in 12 months, in 24 months, when I achieve or finish this role, here's the paragraph I'll write. Here's a problem I solved. Here's the skill I built. Here's the headwind I faced. Here's what I did to overcome it." Use I in the sentence, do not use we. We will do good things. You are who we are thinking about, your career. We're not looking for we. Master the story now. Understand the story. If the story sucks, you probably should be thinking through how to make the story not suck. But that to me is a very good career decision and I think everyone is building their story today. I want to know that story. I want that story to be incredibly compelling because whether you promote it or not, that story's compelling. You'll be promoted in career. And that's what we're here for.

Lenny (01:22:48):
Nikhyl, this is the first time we've ever met. I'm such a fan instantly. This might be my new favorite episode. I'm so excited for people to listen to this. There's so much value here. Two final questions before we wrap up. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more? And also, talk about maybe various community, The Skip, and all that stuff that people can check out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:23:09):
I'm building this brand around The Skip because I'm so passionate. There's two outlets that people can easily connect. One is the podcast, which much like yourselves is available on Apple and Spotify and others. So I'd love for people to join my podcast and hear. What I'm now moving my podcast to is almost like coaching calls. Because I have so many of them, I'm saying like, "Hey, 30 minutes, let me walk you through a problem and hear how I'm thinking about it, whether that's a transition discussion or compensation discussion, et cetera." And then the other one is this sort of newsletter that I have on Substack, which is a bit of a mirror of the podcast. It's different forms of the same topic areas. So, would love for your listeners to connect with that.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:23:54):
I think as far as getting in touch with me, LinkedIn is where I spend most of my time professionally. So between Twitter and LinkedIn, my presence is relatively easy to find. And then how listeners can help me, I mean, one, you can build the most fulfilling career story and be your best, but also give back and pull others forward. Whether that's through your act three or whether that's just helping others, I mean, I think that would be the most fulfilling to me. I think feedback from your listeners to me on things they wish I would spend time talking about is incredibly empowering for my content because then I can deliver more meaningful content. It's very different from yours, but I think it's all around the arc of trying to help people gain forward and be more effective tech professionals. So I would love to hear from your listeners.

Lenny (01:24:48):
Just to make sure people know where to go to do this. For feedback, do you recommend LinkedIn?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:24:53):
Yeah, LinkedIn is the ideal, but you can also find me on Twitter if you are just trying to add a quick... If you're trying to follow me, follow me on LinkedIn. If you're looking for feedback, just tweet me.

Lenny (01:25:03):
And then for The Skip newsletter, what is the URL to go check that out?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:25:06):
It's theskip.substack.com.

Lenny (01:25:09):
Amazing. And you don't publish often, but each issue is incredibly valuable, so we'll definitely link to that all in the show notes. Nikhyl, thank you again so much for being here. I will let you go now. This was amazing.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:25:21):
Yeah, thank you, Lenny. Appreciate it.

Lenny (01:25:23):

## Transcript

Nikita Miller (00:00):
And many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal, and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much.

Lenny (00:52):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikita Miller. A huge thank you to Camille Ricketts for recommending Nikita and for connecting us. Nikita is senior vice president and head of product at The Knot Worldwide. Before that, she was VP of product at Dooly, and before that she was head of growth and retention at Trello for over five years. In our conversation, we dig into how product managers and people getting married are similar, a bunch of advice on getting into product management, a really cool framework for how to align roles and responsibilities within your cross-functional teams, a bunch of advice for working effectively as a remote and distributed team, and the one question that Nikita asks constantly to get the most out of her teams. Nikita is amazing and I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Nikita Miller after a short word from our sponsors.

(01:51):
This episode is brought to you by wealth fronts. Anyone paying attention to the stock market over the past few years knows it's been a wild ride. Many people who made risky stock bets during the bull market are now facing big losses and wondering how to make better informed investments going forward. That's why I'm excited to tell you about Wealthfront's new stock investing product, which is specifically designed to help you make better stock investments. It has all the features you'd expect, including fractional share, zero commissions and $1 minimum. But what sets it apart is a unique feature called Stock Collections. These are groups of stocks created by Wealthfront's investment team that are designed around unique investment opportunities. You can think of Wealthfront Stock Collections like Spotify Discovery Playlists, but instead of helping you find new songs, they help you discover new companies and themes to invest in.

(02:38):
For example, some popular collections right now are dividend to blue chip stocks, semiconductor leaders, and rising interest rates, and each collection includes a summary of the opportunity and trade-offs to help you make more intelligent investing decisions. To start investing with just $1, visit wealthfront.com/lenny. And note, I'm a Wealthfront client and they arranged for me to share this product with you. Important disclosures and details can be found in the show notes. Are you hiring, or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand curated people who are open to new opportunities.

(03:21):
Thousands of people apply to join this collective, and I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a new opportunity, actively or passively, join the collective. It's free, you can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave anytime and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. Nikita, welcome to the podcast.

Nikita Miller (03:59):
Hey, Lenny. Thank you. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (04:02):
I'm excited to have you. So I don't know if you know this, but I'm actually having a kid in a couple months and I've been doing a lot of reading, as you do when you're going to be a parent. And I was reading a lot of stuff on The Bump, which turns out I realized was something that it was in your umbrella of products.

Nikita Miller (04:15):
It a part of The Knot Worldwide. Yeah.

Lenny (04:17):
And then I realized y'all have that for pregnancy, you have a site to help you with proposals, you have a site for obviously wedding planning and vendors and just party planning in general. And so is the general strategy to be there for every adulting milestone in life? Is that the plan?

Nikita Miller (04:34):
Yes. That's a nice way of putting it. We talk about it as being there for the big celebrations in life. We have these celebratory moments that mark adulthood, and so to be part of that journey, we primarily focus in the wedding space but yes, across the whole journey.

Lenny (04:52):
It feels like the two pieces you're missing are divorce and funerals. Is that the plan or do you want to stick to happy things?

Nikita Miller (05:00):
I think we're sticking to celebrations. I think we're leaning on the world needs a lot more celebration right now, so helping folks do that.

Lenny (05:07):
You're here. Okay, cool. It's a really smart strategy. It makes a lot of sense, once you get someone with their wedding and then they expand from there.

Nikita Miller (05:15):
And their friends too.

Lenny (05:18):
Interesting, right, because they register on The Knot and they'll know what's going on there.

Nikita Miller (05:22):
That's right. You register.

Lenny (05:24):
Genius. So we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned along your time there, but I wanted to start with your previous gig at Atlassian and specifically leading growth and retention at Trello. Many people listening to this podcast either use Trello and love Trello or are thinking about using Trello, and so I thought it'd be interesting to hear just who do you find Trello is the most ideal for? When is it good and smart to go with Trello versus Jira or Linear or Asana or something like that?

Nikita Miller (05:53):
A few things. So I think Trello initially started out as being the task management or planning tool for anyone as opposed to the others you just mentioned, which tend to be in software in our industry, and that's who we're geared towards. Trello when it first started was very much on being simplicity of design, being easy to use, tactile, easy to onboard. You don't need customization, you can use it in single-player mode or multi-player mode. And so that meant that at the beginning, we got a lot of people using the product that were small businesses, that were families, that were people planning their weddings potentially. 

(06:32):
And then over time, as our users became more sophisticated or had more problems to solve, that's how I think we evolved and grew with them. So some of it's around this concept of progressive disclosure where you start with a small problem and as it gets more sophisticated, Trello grows with you, whereas I think some of the other products, they start with complexity and if you want something simpler, you kind of have to pull things away or tease things apart. And that was definitely something that helps Trello stand out. I think now, many years later, you'll find that Trello is very fully featured and fully powered and they now lean into that a lot more, but that wasn't always the case.

Lenny (07:14):
So it sounds like Trello broadly was meant for a lot more than just software teams building product?

Nikita Miller (07:18):
Yes. It started off I think being inspired by software teams and wanting to understand how to move and manage tasks easily. That was the origin story, but then very quickly became the kind of tool that anyone could use to manage anything. And now I think we're back more the product is way more towards the software development and that's a lot more of the competitive advantage, but I think the people that are excited about Trello and the ones that made Trello really impactful weren't necessarily software.

Lenny (07:50):
Got it. When you think back to your time helping grow and retain folks on Trello, is there a big win or something you're really proud of that you think back to that was a huge success in that time to help Trello grow more or be more successful?

Nikita Miller (08:07):
That's probably not what you'd guess. So when I started Trello, I actually joined to build out Trello's enterprise business. And so a lot of our growth and retention was actually about how to get more teams into the product and then spreading it throughout the org, so not only software teams but sales teams or marketing teams. And so the big push there was around collaboration. How do you create a shared perspective for everyone working on a project, not just a software team?

(08:38):
So we had a good time thinking through what's the customer experience, but obviously in the context of enterprise, which for Trello at the time was really tricky because it's such a customer first product, I think shifting our mindset to understand enterprise and teams specifically as a cohort was very different. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that or the team did a good job of that, and I think being a part now of the Atlassian suite definitely leaned into that even more.

Lenny (09:09):
Was there a specific feature that unlocked a lot of opportunity or is it just broadly, there's a bunch of little things you have to add?

Nikita Miller (09:15):
I think it was broadly a bunch of little things. So all the enterprise features that you can imagine that all products need to operate at the enterprise level, smaller features around labels like how do you color them? How do you name them, when do they appear? When you invite people, do you invite individuals or do you invite teams? So a lot of the work was around going from single player or two, three player mode to 5, 10, 20 people.

Lenny (09:41):
Got it. Coming back to the question of Trello versus Jira, because I think this might be interesting to people. Just if you're trying to decide should we use Trello or should we use Jira, what's a simple way to think about which way to go as a founder maybe or as a product team?

Nikita Miller (09:55):
I think that smaller teams, especially folks that are ideating, when you haven't landed on what you're going to build yet, I think Trello's a great product for that. For pulling ideas, for prioritizing them, for tracking how we're progressing through discovery, I think Trello's really great for that. For things that have been decided and are ready to go and are really in the breakdown these tasks and assign it to people, then something like Jira is probably a better use case, but I'm sure there people that'll disagree with that.

Lenny (10:29):
Cool. Building for PMs is what you were doing while you were working in Trello. I imagine that's kind of a bittersweet experience. I imagine in some sense they're an amazing market to sell to, on the other they're probably really annoying. What's a surprise maybe or a lesson about working on building products for product managers?

Nikita Miller (10:46):
I think you're right, it is a bitter sweet place to be. I think I less thought of it as building for product managers and just thought about it in the context of productivity overall. And productivity software in itself is really what's bittersweet because there are a lot of trade-offs and when you're dealing with a software team, for instance, how you measure productivity or define it for a PM or a designer or engineer and a data scientist is probably really different. And so the impossibility of solving for all of those use cases I think is always what's challenging, and we know that no one product is actually going to solve all of those use cases, no matter what the marketing taglines are out there.

(11:29):
And so it was really challenging to figure out what are the core things that a product manager might need to see or a designer or a developer, and how do you make sure that that core is there? So you get the 80% and then you spend time on the 20% that you know a very small segment of users are going to use, but they're probably your core, so maybe you spend some time there. But the answer is no one's going to be happy, and with Trello in particular it was challenging because for a while we built a product that was easy to use for everyone, and so then trying to really narrow in on well, what is a software development use case and what do we really need for that? And that might be very different from what a mom-and-pop shop is going to need or someone planning their wedding is going to need.

Lenny (12:15):
That's a good segue to something else I wanted to ask about. You used to build for product managers and now you build for people getting married. I'm curious what is similar about those two groups and what's maybe most different?

Nikita Miller (12:26):
A lot of similarity. So folks planning their weddings, think of it as an emotional, high stakes thing that you're hopefully going to do once, and so the pressure is really there. The pressure and expectations are really high, not unlike product managers or other folks in software, and ultimately wedding planning is this huge project where you have a bunch of stakeholders, friends, family. You need to manage multiple vendors, and the time horizon for a wedding once you're engaged is anywhere from 12 to 18 months, so it is a longtime project. I think there's a lot of similarities there. 

(13:06):
Some of the things that are a little bit different in terms of how we're building the product is the amount of decisions probably that need that go into wedding planning are far more than you'd imagine. So one of the reasons being at the Knot is so interesting is we go all the way from planning tools, so actively, how do you help people find inspiration and plan their wedding day-to-day to two-sided marketplace. We have our e-commerce business that's supposed to be registry and paper and obviously our affiliate businesses and the ads businesses, so it's a little bit different from a SaaS productivity tool, the business that we're in, but a lot of the problems that we're solving for users are actually really simpler.

Lenny (13:48):
Which one's more, I don't know, stress inducing.

Nikita Miller (13:51):
That's a great question. I think that couples, it's such an emotional thing for people, for individuals and their families and their friends, so I personally feel like I empathize with that in a way that I don't do the same for product even though I'm a product manager, because there are many projects and there're always things that we need to manage and that's just part of the gig. Whereas planning your wedding, for couples this is for many the most meaningful time of their lives, and everyone does this differently. So we have folks that are planning their multi-hundred person weddings and then there are 10, 15 closest friends weddings, but the emotional side of it is the same and you don't want to let them down because most aren't going to do it again.

Lenny (14:38):
Yeah, okay. That's what I would've guessed. It feels like wedding couples are more stressed. I just had an idea. I imagine you think about this. We're doing a baby shower right now and it feels like you're missing a opportunity to do the baby shower invite platform.

Nikita Miller (14:51):
Yes, we've thought about it.

Lenny (14:54):
And also registry, a registry platform.

Nikita Miller (14:56):
Yes, also that.

Lenny (14:59):
Okay, okay. So many opportunities.

Nikita Miller (15:00):
All the life moments.

Lenny (15:01):
Oh my God. One last question about Trello. Do you have any just tips for someone using Trello and may not be aware of something they could do with  Trello?

Nikita Miller (15:09):
I think the biggest that people probably know about but are often underutilized are Power-Ups, which is basically our integrations. And Power-ups are folks that are usually doing things that are more complex, often. But Trello, when you think about it with other products like Asana, as you mentioned, Linear, some of what people are worried about is that it's just not powerful enough, and Power-Ups are a way to do that. And there are dozens and hundreds of integrations that you can use it for. So that's worth checking out.

Lenny (15:39):
Awesome. Great tip. Shifting a little bit and zooming out, you've worked at a lot of different companies at a lot of different levels, also a lot of different geographies and I want to chat about that last piece. But maybe just broadly, what are a few of your biggest lessons about building successful and impactful teams?

Nikita Miller (15:59):
This is kind of my jam.

Lenny (16:01):
Excellent.

Nikita Miller (16:02):
It's kind of what I spend a lot of time thinking about, and I think every company go into you approach it slightly differently. For me, it usually starts with individuals identifying very clearly early on roles and responsibilities, like what are the expectations of a role? So in software, for most of us one of the things that I think I've seen done well or contributed to and multiple companies is the triad, product, design, engineering, data. And what does it look like for these roles and data science that's like other?

Lenny (16:38):
I see you put data in there.

Nikita Miller (16:42):
I'm trying pull that in. That is my mission. I love that. My mission is product, design, engineering, data.

Lenny (16:47):
It's not a triad anymore though, but I love it.

Nikita Miller (16:50):
I know. It's a quartet something.

Lenny (16:50):
It's just a chair.

Nikita Miller (16:53):
It's a chair. Great. So I think about that a lot. What are the roles? What do you expect for each of them and how do you define the responsibilities that we have to each other? I know it sounds maybe on the softer side, but I think a lot of what we can solve for in creating strong teams is exactly that. The exercise that I often do is I generally have an idea of what I think the roles and responsibilities are and the expectations across these four roles, but the exercise especially with leaders in an org is to have them sit down and write them for each other.

(17:29):
So Atlassian has some of this that they do in the form of playbooks, but it's basically I as a product leader, I'm going to write down what I think the expectations and the role and responsibilities of my engineering manager, of my designer, of my data. And then we look at it together and then we arrive at essentially a contract with one another about what we think that looks like and what that responsibility is to our teams, and from there, we cascade it throughout the org. This is very time-intensive, as you can imagine, and often leads to a lot of debate because depending on the kind of orgs or people's backgrounds, our expectations might differ, but I think that contract early on is really important.

Lenny (18:08):
This is super interesting and I want to go two levels deeper. Is there a template that you have? Is there specific questions you're answering? Is it freeform? How do you actually know what to write in one of these?

Nikita Miller (18:21):
There is a template. There are templates we can probably share after this-

Lenny (18:24):
Awesome. Great.

Nikita Miller (18:25):
... to run the roles and responsibilities, and it usually comes in a couple of forms. It's what the expectations as an IC? What's the expectation as a manager or with your team? And then what is it to each other and what are the things that are shared? So when we're running an experiment, a product manager's likely to write a product brief and go into the details of what that means. The data scientist is likely to help write the actual experiment brief, but we're all putting inputs into it. But then when it comes to data and analysis, my expectation is that both of you are doing that together.

Lenny (19:01):
And is the idea the PM writes, "Here's what I'm planning to do," is it the data scientist writes on behalf of the pm, "Here's what I expect you to do?" Who's taking the charge in each of these?

Nikita Miller (19:11):
You write your own. So I as a product manager, I write what I think my role is and also what I think what my expectations of my counterparts are and they do the same, and then we review it together.

Lenny (19:23):
And you encourage every team within your domain to do this amongst themselves. 

Nikita Miller (19:28):
Yes. 

Lenny (19:29):
That is very cool. If there's an example you could share that we could put in the show notes or a template, that would be great.

Nikita Miller (19:35):
Yeah. We'll do that.

Lenny (19:36):
What have you found as impact that comes from doing this a before and after? What kind of difference do you see having done this on team?

Nikita Miller (19:45):
So I'd say recently, I'd say in the past maybe five years, one of the things that has shifted and has caught some people by surprise, I don't know if it should or not, is around project management. So I think 10, 12 years ago, everyone expected that they would have Scrum Masters, and Scrum Masters have largely in many companies just disappeared. But then you think well, where did that responsibility go, because someone has to do project management? And this is different from program management internal to a team. 

(20:18):
And from my perspective, a lot of that now sits with engineering managers, which is a little bit different from how it was when I started in product where actually, a lot of that was put on PMs. And some of you might recall, it caused a lot of issues with product managers because they were the ones that were constantly like, "What's happening in the sprints? What didn't make it? Why didn't it?" Doing a lot of that work. And I think PMs are still responsible to keep track of that, but engineering managers are increasingly expected to be the ones that are actively making sure that sprint goals, for instance, are met. And that's a shift that I've seen recently that we do have to debate often.

Lenny (20:57):
I think one of the most interesting elements of this approach is that the product manager role is so I ill-defined and so different in every company, and so I imagine much of the benefit here is just what the hell is the PM's responsibility?

Nikita Miller (20:57):
100%.

Lenny (21:10):
Is there anything that you find is surprising about what teams end up taking off the PM's plate or putting on the plate that maybe other companies don't?

Nikita Miller (21:18):
I think a lot of people end up putting a lot on the PM's plate because of that misunderstanding. And so you end up looking at something as a group and saying, "Well, no one human can do all of those things all the time, so let's talk about what the shared responsibility looks like." And what I think is really powerful about the triad is that it's a recognition of there are shared responsibilities. Who's responsible for making sure that everyone understands what we're doing and why, the PM leads that, but evangelizing that is something that would be expected of designers and engineering managers and data scientists as well.

Lenny (21:57):
On the data scientist piece, you talked about how you're trying to embed that more and more into product teams. At Airbnb, data scientists were embedded in every team, so I totally get that.

Nikita Miller (22:05):
It's not everywhere.

Lenny (22:07):
Yeah, exactly. What more can you share there of just why you found that to be important and how you're approaching that?

Nikita Miller (22:13):
From my experience as a product manager, it was always a blocker. Getting your hands on the data, maybe having someone to troubleshoot with if as a PM you couldn't kind of understand or figure it out yourself, it was just always a blocker. And so then you'd also then have to go and negotiate with other teams about getting someone's resources to look at this problem, so that's one. The other is just that data scientists, as with most humans, we get better the more focused we are and the more in depth we are in understanding the product itself. So if you have someone that's dedicated to a zone or an area of the product, then it's much easier for them to spot patterns as opposed to attempting to understand what's happening every time a ticket comes in.

Lenny (22:58):
And so the shift you push for is instead of a centralized data team that you convince to give you resources, you embed the data scientist into the team.

Nikita Miller (22:58):
Right.

Lenny (23:07):
And do you call them data scientists, do you call them analysts? How do you think about that?

Nikita Miller (23:11):
That also varies per company. That depends on the organization and the work. Some teams require data scientists, not all. Some require analysts, so that just depends on what the team's working on, what's needed.

Lenny (23:27):
Got it. Coming back to the roles and responsibilities framework, do you encourage teams to revisit that every once in a while or is it like this team's done this thing and we're good for a while?

Nikita Miller (23:36):
I encourage them to revisit it and it's usually because something's fallen off the rails. I think if they were really great at it, I'd say every three months or every six months, let's have a look and see how this is going. But often it happens because there's some conflict or tension or something was missed and someone thought it was theirs or not and we have to do a quick retro.

Lenny (23:59):
What do you find is often that thing that is maybe missed or often causes tension?

Nikita Miller (24:04):
Execution. It's usually around execution and velocity.

Lenny (24:10):
Not moving fast enough?

Nikita Miller (24:11):
Not moving fast enough.

Lenny (24:13):
What do you find often is a way to help with that as a leader of teams?

Nikita Miller (24:18):
Well, one, just identifying what the velocity issue is. It can vary, so for PMs it's often around the velocity of decision-making. How long does it take us actually from saying we need to do a thing to defining it potentially, and then deciding are we actually going to do it or how? And that I think takes a long time for most companies, most people. So velocity of decision-making, so I think that tends to fall on the PM most often. The actual execution of it, the development tends to fall on both PM and engineering. So in engineering I find that depending on the org, some folks understand breaking up tickets into small pieces and why that's valuable and how to do it, and that's something that I think everyone in industry probably needs a refresher on, why that's valuable and how it works. And some of that is also shared by the PM because if you haven't articulated clearly or well enough what we're trying to do, then it is hard to break that apart. So those are the two things that are on my mind a lot.

Lenny (25:27):
Is there anything else along the lines of what you've learned about building successful teams? I really love this roles and responsibilities approach.

Nikita Miller (25:35):
Outcomes and output also comes up a lot, and many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. 

(26:10):
So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much. So that conversation is one that I think we often have to revisit on all the teams I've ever been on that yes, outcomes are important, but also the indicator is around execution and velocity. So if that's not in line, then a lot of the other things don't matter that much.

Lenny (26:50):
And so when you say outcome, you're saying here's the goal they're achieving or the impact they're having, or is it just the idea we know what our outcome will be but they're not actually shipping anything? When you say output and outcome, what are you referring to specifically?

Nikita Miller (27:04):
The outcomes are understanding what the goals are and what we might do to get there. So OKRs is one way to talk about that. Great. But embedded in that is and how are we going to get there? And the fact is, the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right. So we're not actively monitoring how fast does it take us to ship things to market.

Lenny (27:28):
I see. So if I can rephrase it, a lot of teams know and talk about what they should be doing. They have a strategy, they have a goal, but what you're finding is that there's just not a lot of action a lot of times and there's a huge opportunity just to get a team to actually ship more often and move faster.

Nikita Miller (27:46):
Yeah. There's not a lot of understanding of our role and urgency. It's urgent, and software in particular. You probably can't forget that because someone else is likely doing something similar or better and faster.

Lenny (28:02):
Makes me think of I think Frank Slootman is his name, the Snowflake CEO. He wrote this book called Amp It Up, where he talks about how to build thriving software companies and businesses in general. One of his three most important recommendations is always have urgency, to never let off the gas of urgency. That things always need to feel urgent.

Nikita Miller (28:22):
I'll check that out. But I think product managers, I consider product to be the ones that really need to drive urgency.

Lenny (28:33):
Say more about that. What have you found helps in creating that sense of urgency and continuing to increase output?

Nikita Miller (28:39):
Mostly reminding people often. And I don't think that's a question of, "Well, show me list of everything you ship. That's never going to work." Well, that doesn't make people feel good about the work that they're doing, but let's talk about our experimentation backlog. What do we have in there? How quickly are we getting those things out? Those are the kind of conversations that I think help. I think that having a good pulse on competition helps as just a friendly reminder that there are others out there doing this and thinking about things very similarly, possibly, to how we're thinking about it, so how do we differentiate ourselves? And a lot of that is about how quickly are we getting many ideas to market? Small tangent. The competition side is interesting to me because I've worked at a few companies where I've worked with founders who are like, "We don't have competition, we're the only ones doing this," and then fast forward a few years and you're like, "Here are all the companies that were your competition that you didn't recognize then that are shipping great product now."

Lenny (29:52):
This might be a tough question, but I think there's always a sense of we can move faster. It's rare that no, we're moving fast as we can. Do you have any kind of heuristic or I don't know, gut feeling of knowing and sensing where this team's doing fine versus this team isn't moving as fast as they can?

Nikita Miller (30:09):
How much time do we spend on what I'd consider optimizations versus bigger bets, and how long does does it take for that to happen? Right? Because you know you've talked to the folks or been in the companies where you talk about something that by most measures is pretty simple. Someone goes heads down for a week or two and gets it done and you talk about it and then two quarters later, someone mentions it again and you're like, "Oh, okay. So what are all the things we did in between that time to now why that seemingly simple thing didn't get done?" And I think that's hard to say as a product manager because everything we do is all about prioritization, and I'm sure there are a bunch of other things that were prioritized, but they're these little things that come up periodically, or bug fixes. Something is broken. How long does it take us to recognize it and actually fix it?

Lenny (31:03):
Do you have a heuristic, speaking of big bets versus optimizations, of just how much time/resources to put into each bucket?

Nikita Miller (31:11):
Unfortunately, the answer is it depends. If you're working on a business that is 30 years old and has many acquisitions, it is very different from a startup or a growth stage company.I think it just varies.

Lenny (31:27):
Yep. That's often what I find. One last question along these lines that was on my mind as you were chatting. When you're finding that a team is not delivering as much output as you would think, what have you found works in helping them recognize that and not get defensive and not have all these excuses for why it's happening, just help them see what you see?

Nikita Miller (31:46):
I'll tell you what I do. I don't know, I think folks might get defensive sometime.

Lenny (31:52):
Yeah, I think.

Nikita Miller (31:53):
But I'll tell you what I try. For me the biggest thing is just if folks are working on a sprint, it's very simply, "What did you deliver this sprint?" That's it.

Lenny (32:04):
Just asking questions.

Nikita Miller (32:05):
Just ask a bunch of questions. "What did you deliver?" And more questions, "Okay, fine, but what did you deliver to production? Great. And how long have you been working on that? How long? What was the cycle time?" So these questions that are really just I think seeking to understand because I understand complexity and so that exists everywhere, but maybe helping folks see that as they're reviewing their own work or their team's work goes a long way.

Lenny (32:35):
And it comes back to your approach of just focus on the output, not what they're planning to do, what they've actually done. This episode is brought to you by Ahrefs.

Shifting a little bit, you've been a PM for a long time, since 2010 I believe, and a lot of people move out of pm and so it's really cool to talk to someone that's been in the field for a while. What have you seen in terms of how product maybe has changed? The role of product management, the role of product leadership, and also maybe other functions like designer engineering?

Nikita Miller (33:51):
I think the biggest change for product at macro is how mainstream it is. I still find fascinating getting degrees in product management and going to business school to transition into product management and the whole discipline. And there's a whole business, honestly, around the business of product management, which I find really fascinating and it didn't exist. And I think for better or worse, that comes with a lot of good and in some ways might have removed some of the quirkiness and creativity that probably is required of product, but that's probably a different podcast. So that's one, just macro. In terms of the roles, I think that what we were talking before about roles and responsibilities and defining those for product managers, I think product managers are increasingly I think a bit more technical or expected to be. I think there was a moment where they were technical and then it was, "No, no, we're all generalists," and now I think we're going back to PMs need to be more technical.

(34:54):
I think designers, the expectation is that they'll be more business-oriented, design as a means, honestly, to an end. I think that's trending and probably for the better. I think the best designers I've ever worked with are also exceptionally savvy business people. And I think engineers are increasingly becoming what more product-focused, more user-focused. So product engineers is something Trello I think did really well. This idea that great ideas can come from anywhere in the org at any function I think is really magical. So as you're seeing PM's becoming more technical, I think designers becoming more business-oriented, engineers are becoming a lot more product/user-focused, to me that's amazing because it means that we're getting closer to what I'd consider really deep collaboration. And it's not to say that we're not experts. There are expertise within that that we expect of folks, but that care for other disciplines I think is where a lot of magic happens.

Lenny (35:57):
That's really interesting. When you say PMs  getting more technical, when you're hiring, interviewing, what are you looking for? Do PMs need to learn to code? How technical do you find they need to be?

Nikita Miller (36:08):
I don't think so, necessarily. I think a lot more PMs are. A lot more PMs are taking boot camps or coding classes, which I think is all to the good. I don't know that it's a requirement, but there is more of that and I think is very helpful. Similarly, a lot more PMs are taking more classes or digging more into data analysis, also really valuable. I don't think it's a requirement. I am not a technical PM, I don't have a tech background. I think I've been doing it long enough at this point to do okay, but I think it's a benefit.

Lenny (36:42):
You said that the PM is becoming more of just a thing with training classes and courses like that? 

Nikita Miller (36:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (36:48):
I did a search once on LinkedIn for how many product managers there are. Guess many PMs there are in the world, that have the title PM in their LinkedIn profile?

Nikita Miller (36:57):
A lot. I'm guessing a lot.

Lenny (36:59):
2 million.

Nikita Miller (37:01):
That's wild. 

Lenny (37:02):
That's wild. And there's 800,000 just in the US.

Nikita Miller (37:05):
Wow. 

Lenny (37:06):
That's a large group that I didn't expect.

Nikita Miller (37:10):
Back in my EdTech days, a friend of mine, her kids were in school and she came in one day, her son was in grade school at the time, in elementary school and he had this match to what careers, what you see, and they had a person at a computer, this image, and it was product manager. There was an option for product manager. And that's when I knew, I was like, "Okay, this is mainstream. We're about to become consultants."

Lenny (37:37):
I always used to joke, no one grows up and is like, "I want to be a product manager when I grow up," but I think that's starting to-

Nikita Miller (37:41):
It's a starting. It's a thing.

Lenny (37:45):
While we're on that topic, I imagine people often ask you for advice on how to get into product management. Do you have any advice there for folks that are listening that maybe want to get into that?

Nikita Miller (37:54):
There are many ways now. I think there are a lot of the typical programs that a lot of the big tech companies have, I think is one way. I think getting into startups as a product manager is a pretty awesome way to get into product because it's just a lot of problem-solving. The problem with that is you don't have anyone to teach you the right way, but the product will teach you the right and wrong way if you're with a team that is moving quickly. I still think working on smaller products and companies is a way great way to get into product management in part because you'll get to touch all of the functions that are required parts of the product discipline, and I think it's hard to get that experience otherwise.

Lenny (38:40):
The PM role, we haven't talked about this, it's just very hard and very stressful and mostly sucks in many ways. 

Nikita Miller (38:48):
Yes.

Lenny (38:48):
And we could talk about that if you want, but it was more of a segue to work-life balance, which I know you have some strong opinions about. So I don't know, you could take it either direction, but just thoughts on work-life balance/how hard the PM role is.

Nikita Miller (39:01):
The PM role is really hard. I feel especially now that I'm managing a lot of teams and PMs at a lot of different levels, I do find that periodically I remind them with the core of my being that, "I know this is hard." It is hard. There are a lot of expectations. You're expected to be competent across many areas all the time, you're expected to have an answer and you're expected to keep your calm and not lose your shit, and that's really hard. It just is. It's stressful. So I think I spend quite a bit of time with my team, my PMs, helping them understand that I understand that. And so when we're problem-solving, let's probably not solve for everything. Let's focus on one of many things that are expected. It's really hard. On work-life balance, as I mentioned to you I think about this a lot, I'm currently a mom and as you can imagine, that's a lot to manage at any given time.

(40:05):
And so recently, when I think about work-life balance, I don't use the word balance, I use optimization. It's this question of what are you optimizing for right now? Whether it's today or this court or this year, with the understanding that I don't think you can have it all at the same time all the time. And so I'm increasingly coming to peace with that. Where that's been interesting over the course of my career, I was chatting with my husband about this yesterday and was thinking about, early in my career I remember when we had big releases, folks would just work nonstop for a couple of weeks. We would stay in the office late, we would come in early. If it was international, we just probably wouldn't sleep because we wanted to make sure we QA'd everything before we released it, and that was an expected part of the product development life cycle.

(40:55):
And that was a lot of my early product years and I just did it and it was very exciting and I quite enjoyed it, but even then, the flip side of it for me was I also was a runner back then, so if I was training for a half marathon or a marathon, then the next week I'd probably do my long run in the morning and not start work until 10:00 AM. That was my version of balance. And I think many of us are lucky enough, especially in tech, that a lot of companies get that form of flexibility. So now fast forward 13 years, it is very similar. I don't do all of the drop-offs and pickups for the kids, but there are some weeks where I'm like, "This is the week I'm going to do all of the drop-offs and pickups," or, "This is the day," and that's felt much healthier for me than this expectation that I'm somehow going to balance it all and everything is going to be equally great or cared for all the time.

Lenny (41:56):
I think what I'm hearing essentially, which I really like and agree with, is sometimes you're just going to have to go sprint and go hard and work really hard and go long hours and then that doesn't need to last forever. And then when it's not, enjoy that extra time and build and recharge and do the things you got to do.

Nikita Miller (42:18):
Yeah. That's about right.

Lenny (42:18):
I find the same thing. I find that just working hard is very correlated with success, and a lot of times that's just a lot of long hours and sometimes you can't balance it for periods of time.

Nikita Miller (42:30):
Right. And it can also be at different points in your life, right? So right now at this particular moment in my life, I'm probably not going to go hard at a super early stage startup because I believe that you probably need to be in person and working really hard together for long periods of time. And not everyone feel this way, I know that. I've had these conversations with lots of friends and colleagues. So personally for me, that's probably not the decision I would make at this moment in my life.

Lenny (43:02):
I get that. Another area I wanted to touch on is remote work and distributed work. I believe most of your career, you were remote or you worked with remote teams and distributed teams and that's such a on-trend thing now where a lot of teams are working hybrid, working remotely, working with distributed teams. What have you learned about being successful working with distributed and remote teams?

Nikita Miller (43:23):
Yes. My entire career has been with remote or distributed teams. That's right. When I started early my career, I lived abroad for a while. I lived in Shanghai. I had a core team there, but also worked for the distributed team in Europe and Latin America, which meant all kinds of crazy hours and lots of sprints like we just talked about. Things that worked well, one, documentation. It's a thing. Asynchronous communication, everyone just has to get used to it and better at it, so increasingly just being better communicators, whether it's on a video or written.

(44:00):
I think that's just really important, and everyone building up that muscle is really important. For all of the roles I've been in, this notion of what does it mean to have really meaningful and valuable in-person time that can sustain you for the remote and distributed time is a really important. I think a lot of what's happened now in COVID and even now, a lot of teams have never met their coworkers. They don't onboard in person, they don't have events or offsites as frequently. And I think flexibility is really great, but I think that really, that makes it really hard, and to me, what I've figured out I think is that it especially makes it hard to solve hard problems.

(44:43):
Solving a hard problem remotely with folks that you haven't spent in-person time with, that you haven't broken bread with, that you haven't disagreed with in person and built that trust is just really hard. In fact, it's much harder. So some of the things I've done even here at The Knot Worldwide is periodically when there's a really gnarly problem, I wave the flag and I say, "Hey everyone, why don't we try and get together for two days and hash some of this stuff out, and then we can go back to our remote lives?" And I think folks have been maybe unsurprisingly very open to that because I think they see not only the efficiency but the camaraderie that can happen there as opposed to what was happening potentially on a Hangouts or a Zoom call.

Lenny (45:28):
What does that event look like? Where do you do it? What's roughly an agenda?

Nikita Miller (45:32):
One, the agenda is pretty tight before we get there. Myself or someone else are responsible for making sure that that's a well-articulated agenda that we all kind of agree on before we even get there, so I think that's one. I think 48 hours, two nights, and that's important to me because it tends to still just be hours in a conference room or a meeting room during the day, but you do need to build in the, "And let's go have dinner since we're all in person anyway, or let's have an extended lunch and maybe an extended day." I think that's just really important. And even early in my career when I was working more internationally, the company I worked for was pretty amazing because two or three times a year, the entire company globally came together for a week or two and it made a huge difference, and many of the folks that I worked with there are still friends and mentors.

Lenny (46:29):
Are you able to share what was the challenge you're trying to overcome in one of these times? 

Nikita Miller (46:34):
I can speak about it generally, which was just we had a change in strategy and we needed to land a couple of core decisions about what we might build. And there were lots of documents and lots of conversations, and back to the velocity of decision-making, remotely that can be really hard because with time zones, someone sends a doc, you comment on it, you get to the other day by the end of the week. And so days and days have passed and we still haven't landed it, and people have really strong opinions obviously that's something that big, so it's like, "Nope. Okay, great. Wave the flag." And not everyone could make it. Most people could, and the folks who could not were, yes, on a screen.

Lenny (47:15):
Was there anything specific in that offsite that helped you get to a resolution?

Nikita Miller (47:21):
In that particular one, it was one, very cross-functional and the unlock there was giving the data person the space to educate all of us. That was it. It was like, "You have the floor, educate."

Lenny (47:40):
I find that's often the solution is people just don't have all the same information that they're basing their decision on, so make sure everyone starts with the same foundation. Awesome. And that comes back to your push to get data integrated into every team and make that part of the four quad triad.

Nikita Miller (47:57):
That chair. It's the chair.

Lenny (47:59):
Anything else around remote work or distributed work that you found to be incredibly impactful or important?

Nikita Miller (48:04):
Well, the flexibility of it that I'm sure you've talked about with others, that is really important. I do think that Trello and Atlassian did this really well, is having standards around a couple things. The biggest one I think was overlapping work hours. So everyone had general flexibility, but there were some set of hours where everyone needed to be online at the same time for the most part every day, and that made a big difference. Onboarding happened in person. I think that in-person onboarding for new folks is really important for everyone. For any new person to an organization, I think how we work culturally, having a contact that you can reach out to, all of that I think is really crucial. I'm definitely of the so much of my early learning was in person and I have no idea how we're going to replicate that in a non-office setting. It's just really hard.

Lenny (49:04):
How long do you try to have that person in the office for onboarding? Is it a week? Is it a few days?

Nikita Miller (49:09):
A week.

Lenny (49:09):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, just a few more questions. You mentioned you worked in China, you also worked in the UK for a while, obviously in the US now. What have you found to be some of the biggest differences in maybe the product culture or just culture in general working in these different areas?

Nikita Miller (49:26):
The confusion around what product management is is universal. That's not specific to US I think, and the fact that it's changing, that I think was the same. I don't know that I've found that many differences in terms of how we approached goal-setting, all very similar. The need for urgency, all those principles I think this are the same no matter where you are. Part of what I experienced when I started in Shanghai was the feeling that the product manager was expected to have all the answers, which as you can imagine was really overwhelming. And so I remember because I was young and I didn't know that much about product management, and I definitely did not have all the answers, I spent a lot of time helping the team help me get answers and that was a little bit of a culture shift in our team at the time. 

(50:25):
And I actually think that's kind of carried me through my entire career, which is trying to figure out how to share the product management load so we're equally responsible for what we're building. So that was a good unintentional learning that I think has been really important for my career. I think that part of that learning that I've had obviously here and in London as well was the figuring out how to make room for creativity. So in Shanghai and also in London at the time, this was a decade now so many things have changed since then, there just didn't seem to be as much room for ideas to come from anywhere, which I think is also related to what I've seen before. 

(51:13):
So making space for people across functions to share ideas and then across geographies to share ideas, especially in companies where English might have been the primary language but most of the employees were not native English speakers, there was a lot of time I think that I felt that I wanted to spend, and I did, on just creating space for people to comfortably share their ideas honestly. And that for me was really formative because I think it's really impacted how I've approached my entire career and I don't know that I would have, had I not had those experiences.

Lenny (51:52):
I was browsing through your LinkedIn post and you said something just like that on LinkedIn of just how formative that experience was for you. I know it's not something people can just say, "Hey, I'm going to go to China and work for a startup," but it sounds like you recommend working at companies of different cultures because it feels like it is a lens.

Nikita Miller (52:10):
Yeah. I do. I also think my family, I'm Jamaican, I'm a Jamaican immigrant, and so all of our experiences inform how we perform our jobs and how we think about problems. And being able to expand that, yes, I would recommend it to every and anyone that gets the opportunity. And I think it's really important as product managers because I think it's really hard to be a product manager if you cannot empathize with the people and problems that you're solving for, and being out of your comfort obviously is one way to learn empathy.

Lenny (52:50):
I love that. One final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, not to not count those questions. Are there just any frameworks or processes or methods that you found to be very valuable in your career as a product leader that you would want to share?

Nikita Miller (53:08):
The question I ask myself and I ask everyone in my life probably, whether it's on my team or when folks, friends talk to me, I always ask, "What are you optimizing for?" That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, lon-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year? Whatever time horizon. And I think that can be just a really illuminating way of thinking about obviously just how are you spending your time? And I think it works for product as well. Every time we talk about OKR or goal-setting, ultimately it is what are we optimizing for some period of time. And I think that always for me, whether personally or in product, is very illuminating.

Lenny (53:53):
I love that. I'm pretty sure I've asked that question 1,000 times myself. One thing I find though is people get annoyed with you just like, "Okay. You're such a PM."

Nikita Miller (54:02):
I know, but it works.

Lenny (54:05):
It does work. What are some instances where you deploy this question? Is it in a meeting where someone's asking a question where you're just like, "What are we optimizing for here?"

Nikita Miller (54:14):
I ask this question all the time. I ask this question to my husband. What are we optimizing for?

Lenny (54:17):
I'm sure he loves it.

Nikita Miller (54:19):
He was a PM too, so he gets it.

Lenny (54:20):
Okay, okay. That's helpful.

Nikita Miller (54:23):
I ask this to my five-year-old, honestly. We talk about it a lot. Now we're going to quarterly planning, all of us, and now we have information from Q1 so let's look at it and say, "Given what we know now, what are we optimizing for? Because it might not be the same thing we did before with new information or it may be," and that's usually just then helping us get better at figuring out obviously how we're doing trade-offs-

Lenny (54:55):
That's awesome.

Nikita Miller (54:56):
... because if the first point isn't clear, then the trade-offs aren't going to be clear.

Lenny (54:59):
Yep. The other question is what problem are we trying to solve here? I feel like I need to make mugs and put these some mugs for product managers. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Nikita Miller (55:13):
Yes. I don't think I prepped this, but I'm ready. Yes.

Lenny (55:16):
Okay. Well, it'll be the most fun then. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Nikita Miller (55:23):
These are not product books. I recommend Anna Akhmatova's You Will Hear Thunder, a book of poetry that is excellent. I recommend almost anything by James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time I most recently reread, and back to software, High Output Management.

Lenny (55:43):
What are some favorite movies or TV shows they've recently watched that you really enjoyed?

Nikita Miller (55:49):
I am really into K dramas right now, and actually-

Lenny (55:52):
Is that Korean?

Nikita Miller (55:53):
... Korean dramas right now. Crash Landing on You, it's great. It's a love story.

Lenny (56:01):
That's wonderful. Very out of the box. I love it. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Nikita Miller (56:08):
For product managers, we think about product in the context of artist, scientist, general manager. Where do you spike?

Lenny (56:15):
Artist, scientist, general manager. Interesting. And is there one you ideally look for the answer or it depends on the role you're hiring for?

Nikita Miller (56:23):
It totally depends on the composition of my team.

Lenny (56:26):
Interesting. Cool. I like that. And a different triad. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Nikita Miller (56:33):
Arc by The Browser Company. I think they're a product that's clearly having a lot of fun and you can feel that in the product. When I first opened it, they have an unveiling experience, which isn't something you'd expect of a browser, and there was something really delightful about it.

Lenny (56:51):
Yeah. I imagine you've heard the interview with Josh. 

Nikita Miller (56:55):
I did.

Lenny (56:55):
What a guy. What a cool product. I love it. We have a whole hour and a half on it, so check that out if anyone wants to learn more about Arc. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact in your team's ability to execute?

Nikita Miller (57:11):
Helping product teams try and use product, design, engineering and data to understand their shared roles and responsibilities.

Lenny (57:19):
Awesome. Call back to our previous discussion. And final question. What's a pro tip for someone trying to use The Knot and or one of the other properties?

Nikita Miller (57:29):
Ooh, good question. Two things, but the big one is probably checking out The Knot Worldwide marketplace. It is the most comprehensive two-sided marketplace to find your wedding vendors to create your wedding team, and you'll find that they're really cool small businesses on there.

Lenny (57:47):
Awesome. I'm going to go check that out. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. I'm going to go and ask my wife what she's optimizing for and read some stuff on the phone.

Nikita Miller (57:56):
Good luck.

Lenny (57:57):
Wish me luck.

Nikita Miller (57:58):
You said she's pregnant, right? She's optimizing for creating a human probably.

Lenny (58:02):
Yeah. That seems right. Okay. I'm not going to ask. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nikita Miller (58:13):
You? I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn, easy enough to find me. I am very responsive actually, or at least I try to be when folks reach out on anything product related. And ask me questions. I think that's always helpful. If you have other ways of doing things, I'd love to hear about it.

Lenny (58:29):
You mentioned also that you're doing some angel investing. Is there anything you're looking for specifically that you'd want people to ping you about?

Nikita Miller (58:35):
I am doing some angel investing, maybe a little bit less so recently, but I'm starting to ramp that up again. So if there are any early stage seed or pre-seed companies out there, you can ping me.

Lenny (58:47):
Amazing. Nikita, thank you again so much for being here.

Nikita Miller (58:50):
All right. Thanks a lot, Lenny.

Lenny (58:52):
Bye, everybody.

Nikita Miller (58:52):
Bye.

# How to drive word of mouth | Nilan Peiris (CPO of Wise)

## Transcript

Nilan Peiris (00:00:00):
Some people focus on conversion rate, like, "I'm going to make this really, really slick." And that's cool. You get a bit more growth. But to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your user socks off. You have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's when you get it.

Lenny (00:00:23):

Nilan Peiris (00:03:32):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:33):
So you're chief product officer at Wise, which I don't know if you knew this, but I'm a very happy weekly active user of. To give folks a little bit of context on Wise, could you just explain, what does Wise do? And also share maybe a few stats to give people a sense of the scale that Wise has reached at this point.

Nilan Peiris (00:03:51):
We're looking to solve the problems associated with cross-border money movement, which is that moving money across border is pretty slow. It's actually really expensive, and it can be really hard to do. We solve it with three products, our money transfer product, which is what we started with, our account, which would be like, think of trying to solve the problems of international banking with our account for people, and for businesses. And then finally we've also got an enterprise product where we take the underlying infrastructure that's powered those products that we've built, and embed them in the banks, and products that people use every day, and then zooming into the numbers. So, we've got to come a little way on the journey. So today we're now moving about $12 billion a month, growing between 30 to 40% year on year. We take about 0.65% on average across all our routes as price, and we've been profitable for about more than four years now, with 20% EBITDA margins.

(00:05:05):
But probably the stat I'm most proud of, and the hardest thing to make happen out of all of that was we acquired 70% of the users that found out about Wise last month through word of mouth. So, contextually, we have 16 million customers, and we're acquiring about a million a quarter, about 10 million actives, and yes, so out of a million that joined Wise the first time, 700,000 found out about Wise from a friend.

Lenny (00:05:36):
There's a couple stats there that really stand out to me. One is you're gaining a million new users a quarter, which is insane. Just like a million new people joining Wise every quarter. That's an astounding number. The other number is what you just shared around word of mouth, that basically more than two thirds of people are discovering Wise and joining Wise through word of mouth. Mouth. I want to spend the bulk of our conversation on this topic of word of mouth. I think it's extremely rare how you've been able to increase word of mouth, and just how much of your growth comes through word of mouth.

(00:06:08):
You've essentially developed a system for how to drive word of mouth, and how to basically structure your team, your goals, your priorities and things like that in order to lean into this growth channel. And so, I just have a million questions around how you think about word of mouth, and the first is just, how do you measure word of mouth? How do you know that say, 70% of your growth is coming through word of mouth?

Nilan Peiris (00:06:28):
We ask customers, is the short answer. So, we have an attribution model, as you can imagine, and we've had one from the early days, and it overlays all the referrer data and cookie data you have on visits comes to the website. So you kind of know that. And then you obviously have the soundtrack stuff, and we sample, and ask customers a set of questions on this, and then overlay that onto the... What turns up in your web tracking as direct traffic to give us a sense of how big that word of mouth number is, and that's what gets us back to the 70% stat.

Lenny (00:07:05):
And very practically, how do you actually ask people? Is there a little pop-up on the website?

Nilan Peiris (00:07:09):
It's actually integrated into the flow. So when we built it originally, we thought it's quite cool, marketing and acquiring customers is part of the product, and we should actually stitch that into the experience seamlessly so that we're able to do this more effectively going forward.

Lenny (00:07:26):
That's actually, at Airbnb, exactly how the team did that, to understand what percentage of growth was word of mouth. It's just a little interstitial popup when you visit say, airbnb.com, "How'd you hear about us?" You think there's some fancy ways to understand the stuff, but it's just like, just ask people, they'll tell you how they heard about it.

Nilan Peiris (00:07:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:07:41):
Awesome. Okay, so just to kind of dig into the meat of it, what has been the biggest shift in helping you significantly grow word of mouth, and make it such a huge lever of growth for Wise?

Nilan Peiris (00:07:53):
Yeah, before I launch into this, let's just also take a step back, and why even focus on this? So in the early days, when I met the founders, Kristo and Tyler. It was quite funny, I got introed to them when they were just the founders, and without a team really, and with the beginnings of a product, and they said, "Nilan, you've got to meet these guys, they've got a great product, they just don't have any customers." And I sat there with them, and we kind of launched the first Google ads, and in the early days you try everything, hoping that something works. But taking a step back, think of money as the ultimate commodity. It's pretty hard to build an expensive business that moves your money somewhere, and it costs a lot, so there's less of it afterwards.

(00:08:48):
So building a brand led money transfer business, the brand's got to be pretty damn good, right? You're going to feel pretty special afterwards, in order to have less money afterwards. So what we're looking for always, but what channels out there are super scalable, and can reach our entire audience, but have an incredibly low distribution cost. So, that's one thing that led us to word of mouth and the other bit, when we get on to talk about marketing later, the other challenge with marketing which is unique is because we are lower price, but a superior product, we have less margin to spend on marketing than others in certain paid channels. So that's another reason why marketing is inherently hard. Our marketing team does amazing work at Wise, in order to work within those constraints.

(00:09:36):
But back to your question, which was like, what's the biggest thing we've done to shift word of mouth. When I joined Wise, and started wrangling with word of mouth, I spent a bunch of time with friends of mine in the US and around the world, Andrew Chen, some of the other growth gurus, this is going back 10, 12 years. It's like what mouths, who's done it? What's the system? What do you measure? There wasn't really anything out there. So we kind of had to figure our way out. So, first step was asking it, and the second step was kind of figure out how do you know what's driving it? And the best proxy we found for this was something that most people have heard of, that we actually used quite a lot is net promoter score.

(00:10:26):
So from the very early days we'd start asking customers, and you probably have seen this survey, "Would you recommend Wise to a friend?"

Lenny (00:10:34):
Never seen that ever in my life. Never been asked that question.

Nilan Peiris (00:10:39):
Exactly. There's [inaudible 00:10:41] you said. And then in the end you've got the scale, zero to 10, and the theory is nine to 10 there are promoters, and zero to seven are detractors. Zero to six, detractors, and seven to eight are kind of neutral on your product. The intriguing bet was when we overlaid this... So we have word of mouth, it's about 50 odd percent, and then we have a referral program. When we overlay the referral data over the NPS survey data, we saw something really interesting.

(00:11:13):
There's very low invite rates at one to six, and not just invite, conversion rates of users that joined for invites. But when we've got people from sixes to this seven and eight group, they doubled the number of people they told. Eight to nine, they doubled again, and nine to 10, they doubled again. So, this is pretty crazy when you see it for the first time. I'm going to get back to your question in a sec, but it's quite core buildup to it, because when you are a product manager, like you've been in your career, one of your jobs is to figure out what metric are you going to optimize for? What are you going to try to get the business to ground behind? And if you optimize for something like conversion, rate and you move conversion rate with 10%, you kind of get this one-off hit.

(00:12:00):
But if you move the NPS from 30% to 50%, you increase the viral coefficient of your customer base. So every customer that goes through tells X many more. When you model this through, the ROI on NPS increases is absolutely huge. So, it's got to say, "Okay, this is the thing to zoom in on, so how to move it?" So, then the second magic of NPS is you get the numbers, but you also get the comments underneath it. I remember in the first year we built the NPS survey, and we emailed out every week all the comments to the whole company, which was pretty small, and we kept doing that, I think up till about three or four years, everyone got the NPS comments.

(00:12:51):
And when you read the comments, and now obviously we've got all kinds of fancy models sitting on top of these things, customers kept telling us the same things, "Make it faster, make it cheaper, make it easier to use." Do you know at the beginning, when I said, "Price, speed, ease of use," we kind of figured this out by thinking hard about this question. How do we make this product so good that people will use, it but they'll recommend it?

(00:13:20):
And customers were pretty clear, the ones that were evangelical, is the word we use, are the ones that had a much... Had this cheaper experience, the ones that were talking about it had a fast experience. So it's about price, about speed, it's about ease of use. And when you generalize and take a step back, and look at consumer product companies, they have these product pillars they call it, and they usually have KPIs around them. The second insight we got, found, is when we entered markets, like when we entered the US for the first time, if we entered with a product that was priced at say 5.9%, and the alternative was six, customers would use us, but they wouldn't talk about us. We only got the advocacy when we were eight to 10 times cheaper. That's when people started talking about it.

Lenny (00:14:11):
Let me actually interrupt you here a bit, just to kind of set a little frame around this, because this is extremely interesting, and I think people may miss, I think, some of the really interesting insights here. What I'm hearing is essentially there's this clear sense that you had to grow through word of mouth because of the business model. You didn't make a lot of money per user, and you didn't have a lot of money to spend thus, to help grow. So essentially it's like. "How do we grow the word of mouth?" And then it's, "Okay, what do we need to convince people to share this product?" And used NPS, which I think a lot of people use, and also a lot of people probably know, "Let's make our product more awesome so that people talk about it." Those are kind of like, "Oh yeah, of course."

(00:14:49):
But I think what I'm hearing is that you did that's really unique, is one, you found this huge delta between these detractors, and even seven or... I guess it was six and below, and then seven or eight, and then nine, 10 kept kind of doubling. So one is just this focus on, how do we get someone from there to there? Two is this really big focus on the comments of the NPS survey, not just like, "Oh we have this percentage of detractors." And then also I love how you just create these pillars, essentially, of like, "We're going to work on these three things. These are the three levers to help grow word of mouth for this product." Does that sound about right?

Nilan Peiris (00:15:25):
That all makes sense. Obviously at the time, it is also way more chaotic.

Lenny (00:15:33):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:15:33):
So, at the beginning, everyone thinks it's 20 different things, and then over time, slowly, you understand that it's these things again and again. And a lot of building a successful businesses kind of building conviction that these are the things that matter. So, now I'd say price, speed, ease of use, it sounds... Like, but yeah, go back to seven, eight years. But we were arguing with each other around what, "Is it trust? Is it this? Is it this?" Trying to get clear on what are the things we missed there.

Lenny (00:16:00):
That would be useful actually to know. It sounds like, of course, it's going to be price and speed, but what are the things you kind of realize you don't need to focus on as much, based on these surveys?

Nilan Peiris (00:16:09):
Oh, wow, that's a really hard one. So, then the challenge, is as you know, everything is important.

Lenny (00:16:17):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:16:17):
Yeah? And that things that we use... We have a bucket called convenience. And inside the convenience bucket, there are many, many things hiding in there. And actually, you can measure this on contact rate, conversion rate, whatever, many different ways, and get many slightly different answers. So, I think I've learned there isn't... I haven't got a good answer on things we haven't-

Lenny (00:16:42):
Well, as you said, trust, which is interesting. Obviously trust matters, but maybe it sounds like-

Nilan Peiris (00:16:47):
Trust certainly matters. Yeah, trust's a good one. Let's talk about that one bit. I'll talk to you through the trust problem. So I ran into the trust problem hardest in marketing. So, just imagine, you just started out, you've got a money transfer company, it's good, your product's really good, it's really cheap. So, you put an ad out, and it says, "Move money with Wise, and really cheaply," is anyone going to click that? People did, right? Is anyone going to use it? Yeah, people did use it. And you did work all the usual trust elements. But the bit I found that really helped, the way I got my head around this, was what people trust is their friends. And this really was way stronger a trust signal than anything I could put on a landing page.

(00:17:40):
And even when people came in through marketing, they'd been told. So marketing can aid recall, and all kinds of things, because people are told by their friends. They'd have a use case later on, then Google, and like, "Ah, I remember, this guy used this." And we do definitely get users, especially today as we've got a larger brand, through marketing direct. But trust in isolation is a really hard problem to solve. You need to get under the skin of what it means. People don't think my money is safe. "I don't know if this company is reputable," to unpick each of these problems and figure out systemically how to solve them. And we've done this to some extent, but really there's a massive shortcut, which is if you deliver your customers a good experience, then figure out, how do you make it so good they'll recommend it? Then that kind of shortcut a lot of really hard trust problems.

Lenny (00:18:28):
What did you find most helped increase trust in that way? Is it just get more people using it and then they'll share with their friends, or is there something you did there to...

Nilan Peiris (00:18:36):
No, it was literally get more people using it, and they'll share with their friends. There's obviously a bunch of learnings we've had around what specific trust sentiments matter, especially geographically, but less powerful in the macro than get more people to use it.

(00:18:52):
So coming back to that, and I'd love to get your thoughts on this one. So, as you said, lots of people go up to NPS, and they kind of heard people talk about it, heard people talk about recommendations. So my learning on this is you've got to work really hard to get recommendation. So, to get a nine or a 10, so our NPS is 70%, so it's really, really high. So it's kind of higher than the iPhone, and Google search. So really, really high, so off the scale high.

(00:19:25):
And when we launch a market, or at the beginning it was much lower, so 20s and 30s. So instead it in context, like banks and financial services NPS is -30. So, most people don't recommend banks. So it's like, comes from a low base. But, what I've found is when you build a product, most founders, and most teams kind of stop when it works. As their next step, some people focus on conversion rate like, "I'm going to make this really, really slick," and that's cool, you get a bit more growth.

(00:20:02):
But to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your users' socks off, and the phrase we use is, you have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's where you get it.

(00:20:24):
So the bar is all the way up there. And to put that in context, that means figuring out how to move money instantly. That means figuring out how to drop the price all the way from six all the way down to 0.35. And that's because there are systemic infrastructure issues in moving money around the world, which some people haven't solved before. And these problems are just really hard to solve. They take years to solve, but they have huge kind of returns when you do it.

Lenny (00:20:52):
I love that just as a framework, is how do... We need to blow our users' socks off. And again, it just comes back to how you can get people to want to share this product, and drive word of mouth, blow their socks off.

(00:21:02):
I want to dig into how you actually just figured out what these attributes are. Obviously you talked about this NPS survey highlighting things. How did you decide it was instant money movement, and some of the other things? Is it just basically looking at these survey results, and picking the things that come up most often?

Nilan Peiris (00:21:20):
Yeah, it was talking to customers, and looking at the survey results, and then through that, in many different ways, price will come up, speed will come up, ease of use will come up, and they kind of aggregate up to that.

Lenny (00:21:31):
I think a lot of people listening are still going to be this like, "Okay, we're just going to make our product awesome, and it's going to grow." And in a sense, yeah, in another sense what you're sharing is essentially kind of a really simple framework for how to actually do that. To kind of go a little deeper there, when you see other people trying to drive word of mouth, trying to drive virality, is there anything you think people often do wrong? Is there other missteps you've taken in trying to drive word of mouth?

Nilan Peiris (00:21:59):
It's this thing around growth rate. So, especially product net growth, which is what we're talking about. So you can imagine, we're going to open a new market to Indonesia, and the fastest way to do it is to take... Someone else has figured out how to move to Indonesia. We take that infrastructure, and we'll plug it into Wise,

(00:22:18):
You know what? We can do this, we'll get some users. But it doesn't grow like a hockey stick. It doesn't grow like a hockey stick because we haven't fundamentally changed the problems in moving money internationally. So, got this mantra, you've got to build a 10x better product than what's there. And if it's 10x product better, basically it doesn't exist already. So if you're plugging in something else, that's kind of a misstep.

(00:22:45):
So it comes from a very logical place, how do I get users quickly? I can take a shortcut in doing this, but that, you kind of realize is wasted effort. So the step then becomes this much harder question of these types of questions. Like what is the theoretical minimum cost for moving money into a market? What is the theoretical maximum speed? Not just make it instant, make it cheap, but what actually is the lowest it could possibly be? And instead of incrementally going, doing a jump to make it a little better, a little better, a little better, you can never get there. How do we take two years, and end up there?

Lenny (00:23:24):
I love that. It's something that I talk about a lot. Something I learned at Airbnb is this idea of working backwards from the ideal, instead of working forwards from how do we iterate and make this better, and better, and better. It's like, okay, if we could start again, and we could create the ideal experience, what would that look like? And then work backwards from what would it take to get there?

Nilan Peiris (00:23:44):
And what's an example of that at Airbnb? What was an ideal that you guys went for and then built?

Lenny (00:23:49):
The ideal was, there's this whole process where the founders hired this storyboard artist from Pixar to draw out the ideal experience of a host and a guest. So, there's these storyboards sitting in the office. I think there's 12 kind of... They call them key frames of, it's just like the booking experience being really seamless, arriving in the home, and being really amazed. Going out and finding things to do.

(00:24:13):
So, this became essentially the vision of the company is let's make each of these frames, these key moments of a journey for hosting a guest as incredible as possible. That was one, and that became essentially the strategy for a few years is just make each of these frames awesome.

(00:24:29):
And then there was another project that they were working on around booking at Airbnb. I don't know if you remember this, if you used Airbnb much, but most of Airbnb back in the day was you request to book with a host, you're like, "Hey, can I stay in your home?"

Nilan Peiris (00:24:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:42):
And turned out 50% of the time the guest was ignored, or rejected, and the host was just like, "Nah, no thank you." Now, over 80% as far as I know of bookings are instant bookings, where you just book and it's done, just like every other place you book online. And so that was a huge transition that I worked on, and that came from, if we were to start Airbnb again today, or if someone were to disrupt Airbnb, what would it look like? And obviously it'd be you just book. You're not sitting around hoping someone is cool with you. So, that came from that idea of just like, what would be the ideal Airbnb experience?

Nilan Peiris (00:25:15):
That is incredibly inspiring. I'll try and share a couple of stories, analogies from Wise. I'll talk about two things. Let's talk about price first. So, it's a good question. So, Moneytrans has been around since the [inaudible 00:25:32]. How does a few people get together? And it's evolved towards moving trillions around the world, and generally retail consumers paying about six to 7% around the world to do it. How do a small team in Europe start out and figure out how to move it? We launched at 0.5%, and now we're down to about 0.35%. So what changed?

Lenny (00:25:57):
Yeah, I was going to ask, how did you do that? That sounds like everyone would want to do that.

Nilan Peiris (00:26:02):
Yeah, so let's try to unpick it a little bit. So, first question you'd ask is, "I know what you're doing, you're losing money on every transfer." It's like, "Especially what you're doing," but we've been profitable for five years. And one of the magical things here was we're actually profitable in every transaction. So it's probably about four or five years ago, I led this project to start to pull together our pricing.

(00:26:30):
So, every month you get bills, and they turn up in your P&L, but every single bill we got, we allocated the cost back to the customer, or the transaction that generated it. And then we add our margin on top, and that's our price. And when you look at this and you analyze it, you'll find obviously there are 20% of customers generating 80% of the costs. And what you do is you get those 20%, you give them a raise, because they should cover their costs, and you drop the price to everyone else. And then the team works really hard on reducing these costs down, and then you move into a different segment in the market as the price costs come down. Does that make sense, Lenny?

Lenny (00:27:13):
Yeah. Essentially charge the heavier users more to counteract less frequent users. And essentially that drives word of mouth.

Nilan Peiris (00:27:22):
Totally, but it's down to this level of, if an Australian customer calls up asking, "Where is my transfer?" That cost of that call gets allocated back to the AUD/GBP route. If a Brazilian business needs like 20 documents in order to be verified before we can give them an account, the cost of verifying check those customers goes back there, so that at a very atomic level starts happening. So yeah, as you said, the more expensive customers end up paying what they cost.

Lenny (00:27:51):
And it sounds like the more expensive markets.

Nilan Peiris (00:27:55):
Indeed, and the more expensive, systemically expensive markets. But let's get to that. So, what are the costs? So if you look at our P&L, there's just three costs at transaction level. You've got people costs, you've got the cost of risk, realized risk, and then you've got partner fees.

(00:28:16):
And so if you've got this mission of moving the world's money for almost nothing, or zero, as close to zero as you can, you've got to invest as much of your cashflow in engineering to try to engineer away these three problems. So just to take them through briefly a bit, and remember, we're trying to do this 10 times better than anyone else. So how do you really change the experience on each of them?

(00:28:40):
I'll cover a couple with you. So let's do the risk one first. There's two risks we have. We have have FX risk, you come to Wise you see your rate, and then you may send us the money a little later. If you're moving a million dollars, you can't usually move it instantly. It might take you two to three days to move it. The rate's locked, could move against us, we'd lose some money.

(00:29:01):
So that cost, if you look back, so we've halved that cost over the last few years, and you can imagine through understanding the bits of the product, they generate exposure, and limiting it, and a bunch of algorithms behind that. But the more inspiring stuff is the people costs, and the partner costs, go through each of these one at a time.

(00:29:25):
So the people costs are our customer service team, operations teams. But I like to think of that as the cost of poor quality. So you bring up customer support if the products are clear, you hire lots of people in the back office. If you haven't automated it. We get like 20% improvement year on year as we're doing that. But come back to your question, how do you step change that? How do you do a 10x better experience?

(00:29:49):
I'll share with you a story from Singapore. It's quite a fun one. Because we went to Singapore about six, seven years ago, and [inaudible 00:29:58], we asked for a license. We had 20,000 people on the wait list, or so, saying, "Wise, please come to Singapore." And we went there, we asked the regular, "Hey, can you give us a license?" They gave us the license, but they said, "You have to physically meet every single customer."

Lenny (00:30:13):
Great.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:14):
Face-to-face. And this happens, this is... Remember, they're banks that people use. So people go into banks usually, and you get face-to-face verified when you open a bank account. We're like, "You don't need to do this in Australia, in the UK, in other countries around the world." They're like, "In Singapore, for your license, you need to do this." So we actually sent a small team out to Singapore, and we opened an office through [inaudible 00:30:43], and customers... You went through this really slick flow, and then you got invited in to come see the team.

Lenny (00:30:49):
Amazing.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:50):
And customers hated it, and it was really expensive, obviously.

Lenny (00:30:56):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:57):
But the magic was we got the customers not to complain to us, but to complain to the government. And it took a year of lobbying, and a year of building, doing something unscalable effectively, before we got the world's first EKYC license in Singapore. So you could take a selfie, picture of your ID, and then you could get verified.

(00:31:21):
And that's what I call a 10x better experience than anyone else in the market, and that led to advocacy and word of mouth off the back of it. And that loop of getting your customers to help was also one of the learnings of word of mouth.

Lenny (00:31:35):
Was the product team involved? Were you involved in that on the ground stuff? Or was it like [inaudible 00:31:40]?

Nilan Peiris (00:31:39):
Yeah, yeah. Generally when we go [inaudible 00:31:43], we're running cross-functional teams, but this is a verification team. The team actually would verify the docs when you sent it to us. They went out to Singapore, verified them onsite, face-to-face.

(00:31:54):
So the fun bit here is why would customers help a company? And this is one of the other learnings on word of mouth. The way I think about this is that there are the rational reasons why people recommend, which we've covered. But there's these emotional ones as well. Softer ones people would call brand. I prefer to call it on the mission.

(00:32:19):
So we do our mission, which is to make the world's money move instantly at the touch of a button, for almost nothing. It was a very personal thing, it was like an internal company thing, to think our customers cared about it. And then we rebranded like eight, nine years ago, our first rebrand, and we wrote our mission and sent it to our customers.

(00:32:41):
We got more new customers from that email being forwarded around than any other kind of marketing. And I show this when I talk at conferences. This email broke all the rules of marketing. It didn't have a call to action, it didn't have a button to sign up, it didn't have anything in it, but people just forwarded it around saying, "You should check out Wise."

(00:32:59):
And it's not all the customer base, but there was a proportion of the customer base that this resonated in. And I think it's the authenticity within which they could see that we were genuinely trying to.... Trying to bring the prices down was a scheme to help us grow faster, which is kind of where it started out, was actually genuinely because founders, they were really upset about how much it cost to money.

(00:33:27):
They found good ways to solve that problem, and they're still really passionate about solving that problem. And they could see that authenticity flows through the whole company, because we got a... When you look at Wise, we're full of people on visas, and immigrants, and people that have worked, and live around the world, and struggled with this problem, and are passionate about solving it. And so they wanted to help us solve it. So the second part of this word of mouth engine is for us, we managed to get this mission thing to work.

(00:33:53):
So somehow we emotionally connect our cause, and then I see going, taking a step back, getting 10x better on price is through our customers helping us do it, which gets us even cheaper, which then brings more customers, that then creates this flywheel that's spins around.

Lenny (00:34:11):
What a flywheel you guys have built. This reminds me of a lot of different things. One is you talked about how there's the reality of the things people need, and then there's this soft, fuzzy stuff that's harder to quantify. I actually is the framework just like that on that product I talked about of instant booking.

(00:34:27):
I kind of built a roadmap around the reality of what people actually need in order to feel comfortable, guests booking instantly. And then I call it the perception, what are their fears about letting guests book instantly? And there's a lot of work to just convince them, you think you're going to get all these guests that are really scary or whatever, but in reality it never happens. It's really rare something bad happens, and if it does, we're going to cover it.

(00:34:50):
So, I think that's a really cool framework when you're trying to get people to adopt something, is think about what do they actually need? And then how do you convince them of the things that are just in their head? And it sounds like the win there was kind of this sharing your mission and your values as a business.

Nilan Peiris (00:35:05):
Yeah, it just sounds, again very tweedy, right? Tweedy, like sounds very corporate, sounds like it's never going to work, but I think it's also... I mean, Airbnb, the authenticity is there. People are passionate about making that experience work for both sides of the marketplace. It's kind of clear. So, I'm kind of taking a step back, personally very passionate about customer-led growth, and how that turns into shareholder value.

(00:35:32):
So, taking a step back, where every business I've ever worked in, it's always got these two lists, a list of things to do for your customers, and then it's got a list of things to do to make money. And you generally do everything you need to do to make money, and you do two things with the customer list, and you go, "Customer led business." And then, neat thing about wise, and I'm pretty sure you'll see the same thing on Airbnb is, we just had one list, which is this list of things that you need to do to make customers happy, and it's prioritized by impact on the really hard things. And if you do these really hard things, they have an incredible impact for customers, but hence on your growth, and on your shareholder value.

Lenny (00:36:11):
That is really interesting. Airbnb is not quite like that. It's actually become more like that with a lot of just like, "Let's build awesome products and not focus on experiments as much." So that's really interesting that prioritization basically at Wise came from, "What are people telling us?" I guess let me ask actually, how did you know what the impact would be on customers? How did you decide? Is it frequency of how often people request it? Is it, "We need to lower the cost, and so we're just going to prioritize the things that will lower prices most?"

Nilan Peiris (00:36:37):
Definitely on the journey at the beginning, you are into split testing, right? Let's try to take apart a split test on price. So, you've systemically dropped the cost. Imagine we drop the cost. The question is, do we drop the price? Do we pass that all on to customers? And do we keep some of it? And split testing on the price thing, if the split test is going to mean you end up with more revenue, it means you drop the price by 10%, and there happened to be that day, more than 10% more customers in the market who, they saw the price at one pound, but they see the price at 90p, at 10% lower, and they're like, "I wasn't going to shift at buy at one pound but I'm going to buy it 90p."

(00:37:23):
So this is pretty hard to do this. This word around conviction is one I use a lot, where you build this conviction that price is what matters. And through this incremental split test, you will take a long time to go there, but at some point you kind of go, "Actually I've got enough conviction." So there's one kind of strategic bet at the heart of Wise. That is if we have the lowest cost platform, and it's really fast, and really high quality, the world's volume will switch to us. And just marginally getting there step by step by step, and trying to track the incremental return is actually slower. And there's a point that comes that you go, "I feel really comfortable investing in price. I feel comfortable investing in speed, because I know it's going to pay back, and not necessarily this month, but eventually it will, and I need to make gains on all three levers in order to get there." Does that make sense?

Lenny (00:38:13):
Yeah, absolutely. So essentially, in that track of work, instead of everything that you did to reduce price, there wasn't an experiment to see, "What impact does this have on growth, or revenue?" Instead, it's just, "We know reducing price is going to help us grow, and so we're just going to track how much we're cutting price." And that's essentially the goals, I imagine, were just cut the price by some amount, find a way to make it this much cheaper every, say, quarter, or year.

Nilan Peiris (00:38:37):
Yeah, that's it. You got it. And that conviction is core. That extends to our product management approach on the UX. So this is a great line for use internally, I'm sure you've heard it, "You can't split test your way to love." So, this experiment led product management approach, where you throw a bunch of things on the wall, and then you kind of see what sticks, and generally we don't advocate this. Obviously there's a bit of it that happens, but generally don't advocate it. Mainly because engineering is expensive, and you can actually figure out what matters to customers through other means. Some of the techniques we've talked, and build it.

(00:39:21):
There's a story I like to share. I had a product manager join our refer a friend team, viral growth team, and invite team, and after a quarter, I said, "So what are you going to build?" And he's like, "I'm going to test everything. I'm going to test the landing page, I'm going to test the subject line, I'm going to test the program so I don't know yet till run through all the tests, then I'm going to come back and tell you what I'm going to build."

(00:39:47):
I said, "You're not going to do this. I'm going to give you three weeks and you're going to pick one thing to change, but you're going to go talk to people, and get quantitative insights, and build your own gut feel around what matters, and then launch it, and submit, test it, and see if it works." But this thing of building conviction on what matters, and I watch how teams slowly build this and you need the data there to make sure it doesn't become a hubris, right? That enables you to make much bigger changes than just experimenting away, and it forces you to get clear on what actually is the problem to solve here, and how do I solve it really, really well? Does that make sense, Lenny, Do you disagree? It's a bit provocative there. Some people are pretty strong in the expert led approach.

Lenny (00:40:30):
No, there's many ways to do it. There's no right way, and it's working. So I'm not going to argue.

(00:40:35):
This episode is brought to you by Masterworks, the premier art investing platform, where some everyday investors have earned a 35% net return. Yes, a 35% net return alongside 16 other exits, including 10 and 17% net returns. Contemporary art has outpaced the S&P 500 by 136% over the last 27 years. Citibank and Deloitte have reported that contemporary art has performed well as an inflation hedge, and the appreciation is almost entirely uncorrelated to other financial markets. Even the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, has said it's one of the greatest stores of wealth internationally. However, there's never been a way to invest in it practically without spending millions. But now Masterworks allows almost anyone to invest in works by artists like Banksy, Basquiat, and Monet.

(00:41:22):
In fact, Masterworks latest exit just last month delivered another double-digit annualized net return for their investors since the New York Times first reported on them in 2019, they've grown to over 800,000 users, and had some new offerings sell out in literal minutes. But you get special access and can jump the wait list queue at masterworks.art/lenny. As with any investment, past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investing involves risk. See important regulations and disclosures and aggregate advisory performance masterworks.com/cv. Again for special access to skip the wait list, go to masterworks.art/lenny.

(00:42:00):
So, what I'm hearing essentially, the experimentation culture at Wise is instead of just run, test everything that you're thinking about, throw out a bunch of ideas and see how they go, it's more, "Let's just decide we believe in this idea, and let's go bigger there, and run an experiment. Maybe not even." Is that roughly how you think about it?

Nilan Peiris (00:42:18):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And is that something that you've seen yourself in practice elsewhere?

Lenny (00:42:23):
It's interesting how many parallels there are to Airbnb, because this is what Airbnb is doing now. There's been a shift recently, where instead of everything is very data experiment driven, it's very just like, "Let's build really great products that the founders are really excited about, and that the execs are hearing from people. Let's just build things that are awesome and launch them, and we believe things will grow." And Airbnb is doing great.

Nilan Peiris (00:42:47):
Yeah, the challenge of this is because it does become this risk thing of where it's like, okay, it's someone's opinion, so I think it's X, right? And everyone thinks they're kind of Steve Jobs type thing.

Lenny (00:43:00):
Yeah. That's right.

Nilan Peiris (00:43:01):
You have some way of using data to get this conviction, and show why this is what we should do, but try to learn how to build that faster CME, slight difference. So, it's less product managers or me saying, "Hey guys, I think it's X." It's generally data driven, and qualitative insights driven as well.

Lenny (00:43:23):
Personally, I would always index towards running experiments just to put this out there, but I think in this case, it makes sense, where you just know, "We need to do these three things, just make it cheaper, make it faster." You don't need to AB test every idea there. Probably the main downside of not testing everything is you may be hurting things along the way, and you may not know it.

Nilan Peiris (00:43:42):
I mean, yeah, so we definitely do... So you're right. But there's a very different thing to when you look at the... From a sample size perspective, you want to do a beta, and understand the negative impact. It's a holdout group that's smaller, than a test to get a significance. It's quite define the criteria to know whether something is breaking, is generally a different thing to say, is this a material result in a test? Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:09):
And along those lines, the other benefit of experimentation is you know the impact. And so, team members can understand, "Here's what I did this quarter, this year." How do you think about just like performance reviews, and people's impact, and that kind of thing?

Nilan Peiris (00:44:21):
Yeah, that's a good one. This one is definitely an ongoing debate. So, I generally ask teams what's their impact? So, every quarter, every team, what... [inaudible 00:44:29] or Kristo will ask, "What did you ship?" And I generally ask, "How many people used it? What was the impact on volume?" Et cetera. And we have analyst teams that can answer this either with pre-post analysis, all kinds of techniques, or all through split tests. We generally have this, the debate is where the analysis slows us down, and we wouldn't make a decision off the back of the analysis.

(00:44:54):
And then, this generally is what you said, where the team needs a validation, mainly for themselves, and maybe a little performance, but not too much. And so, there were ways in which you can maybe get some read on it that isn't quite as strong as a split test, which we'd use in these things. It's more just getting some... You can understand that people worried when you do split tests that slow down the release of something, but in order to get impact, if you know you're not going to roll it back, then okay, you should just roll it out, and try to reduce the need for that validation.

Lenny (00:45:31):
I think that there's an interesting correlation between products that grow through word of mouth, and less need to experiment with everything. Airbnb is also actually 70% of growth is word of mouth from the last stat that I heard. And then you think about all these social consumer apps, they mostly grow through people sharing with their friends, and a lot of them come from just the founder's intuition of what a great product's going to be. I think about Snapchat, and the recent mobile social apps. And so I think maybe there's something there about just as a founder, trusting your gut more often. But then it becomes difficult as you grow. You have to delegate, and then you have to trust people on your team making the right decisions. I guess, is there anything there that you've learned about just trusting individual product teams to make decisions that you can't for sure know are positive or negative without running experiments?

Nilan Peiris (00:46:23):
So, as I say, almost everything we do, we have some way of understanding the impact. So, that's always there. We definitely have things where the team does something where Kristo or I will say, "This is just crazy. There's no way they're going to use this." And then we have a culture where people are encouraged to do these things, if they believe in it.

Lenny (00:46:48):
Is there an example of that?

Nilan Peiris (00:46:49):
Yeah, a couple. So the one [inaudible 00:46:52] that my head of SEO always talks about is a currency converter. So, the Wise homepage is a pretty good currency converter. It's got a decent one on there. There's tons of traffic on currency converter. So, if you click Wise link, now it's a little bit hidden on send, it's there. It's pretty cool. Currency converter.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Oh I see it at the bottom there. Yeah, it's like [inaudible 00:47:13].

Nilan Peiris (00:47:14):
But if you Google currency converter, there's tons of traffic, and that converter on the Wise homepage obviously includes our price, and lets you sign up. And so, should we build a currency convertor? Should we try to capture this traffic? Is it more effective to try to push our own product there? And you can kind of understand why it was Kristo, actually not me, that was like, "This is a crazy idea." And the founder, and the SEO team went out and built it, and it's huge now, in terms of visits. I think we've got a currency convertor app out there. I think we've got [inaudible 00:47:51] out there, and yeah, people discover wise through that, as an example of off-topic traffic, but that's a good example of one of those things where yeah, the founder said, "No," or, "That's' a bad idea," and we kind of went ahead, and did it anyway.

Lenny (00:48:07):
Awesome. I'm just thinking about broadly all the things we've been talking about. There's a couple of things that were floating around in my head. One is, reminds me of Amazon, where Jeff Bezos realized there are things that are going to be always true with Amazon. People always want cheaper prices, they want faster shipping. And I think there's something else. And it feels like you guys found the same sort of thing. What are the three things people always want with a money transfer product? And let's just make those as incredible as possible, and in your eyes, make them 10 times better than what anyone else has out there.

Nilan Peiris (00:48:40):
Yeah, totally. The business one example is relevant, and use it a lot when we talk to investors in the market, [inaudible 00:48:49] public helps validate this low cost, cutting price story. What's interesting is what changed though. So we started with transfers, but we got to account, and then we got to enterprise. Just what changed was we realized with account, if you just have to move $10, you're not going to download an app and do it. If you do it once, you're just going to do it in your bank. And so, that was a little bit of the insight behind building the Wise account, and we kind of focused on, there's a real problem with international banking.

(00:49:22):
So, really good example is for businesses. So if you are a business, say, in... Say a business in Europe, you've got a customer in Australia, and you want to get paid, you send them an invoice in Euros, and someday, some money's going to turn up in your account, you're like, "I don't know." They paid you an AUD, it got changed by three banks on the way through. You don't know what it is. What you'd love to do is invoice them in AUD, and get AUD in your bank account. You might even have people who need to pay in AUD, so you have to call to keep it there. But to get an Australian bank account, I found out, you need to fly to Australia, you need to incorporate a business in Australia, you need to go to a bank with all those papers, and then they will give you an Australian bank account number.

Lenny (00:50:06):
Great.

Nilan Peiris (00:50:07):
So with Wise, you can get an Australian bank account number with three clicks. Anyone can, and any business can, and you get an Australian balance, and a US, and a UK, and a Swiss bank. And this is killer for businesses that receive money internationally. And then the next big jump we did, and for consumers, so there are plenty of people, if all your banking is in the US, you probably shouldn't use Wise, but if you're somebody who uses another currency a lot, then you probably should use us as your primary bank.

(00:50:37):
There's some people, for example, who live in one country and get paid in another currency, and this is... Wise is great as an account for managing that. And we found with that, we got about... As we launched the account in markets, it was about a 20 to 30% more volume, cross-border volume coming into Wise from that market. Just a good example of how, while it's not price, not speed, you could argue is kind of ease of use, but we had to evolve it in order to get to the next tranche of the market. Does that make sense, Lenny?

Lenny (00:51:07):
Absolutely. And it all just comes back from what would be the theoretical ideal situation for people transferring money, say from Australia. And what I'm hearing is just find all the little friction points that get in the way. In this case you're like, "Okay, we'll create you an Australian bank account, and you don't even worry about it."

Nilan Peiris (00:51:25):
Yeah, that's exactly it. And so now then you have all these other problems, because we've got about $12.5 billion in deposits now, which is like a time. And the next problem customers are at is, "I want a return." And we quite deliberately don't have a banking license. You have to figure out, how are we going to solve that? We now put customers money in government bonds, US bonds, and when you pay with your card, it dynamically sells those bonds. And that's how we give you an interest rate, in roundabout 5% right now, given where bond rates are.

Lenny (00:51:58):
Yeah, interest rates are quite high, for better or worse. Zooming out a little bit, for folks that are starting to... Their wheels are turning, they're like, "Okay, I want to think about word of mouth, driving word of mouth. I'm going to go look at my survey results. I'm going to figure out these pillars that are driving word of mouth. I'm going to think about how to make things 10 times better." Just broadly, for someone that's starting to approach this, what would you say to them? How should they approach this? Any major learnings at a higher level, of just how to drive word of mouth for a product?

Nilan Peiris (00:52:30):
I think it just comes back to talking to customers and this is the question we've kept coming back to. What would it take to make it 10x better? And then you get clear in your head what it would take, and then it's usually the thing that everyone's looked at before and thought, it's the thing that's impossible. One more example is on the partner side. So, rather than find a cheaper bank for a banking partner, you think, well, the cheapest banking partner is the central bank. And imagine you're a startup. How the hell do you get a bank account at the central bank?

(00:53:08):
But that kind of thinking, and we now have a bank account at the Bank of England, the National Bank of Singapore, Bank of Australia. And each of these was as hard as getting that face-to-face verification thing in Singapore. It took years of lobbying, and all kinds of stuff, in order to make it happen. But it's setting your goal all the way up there. That's what enables you to build a 10x better product. That's what gets you to the word of mouth. So, the first step is getting super clear on what's the problems that my customers are caring about, worrying about? And then once you're clear there, as you said, how can I solve that completely, and what's the best it could possibly be? And then the hard bit is figuring out how to move that.

Lenny (00:53:48):
A lot of these things you're talking about are just, they sound like they are either impossible, like no way we're going to achieve that, or really, really hard. And a lot of companies, and a lot of founders, teams are just like, "Okay, we're not ever going to create a bank here. We're not going to be able to create an Australian bank account for everyone." What is it about your culture, or approach to these problems that you think that's unique to Wise that's like, "No, we're going to spend three years figuring this out, because it's that important?"

Nilan Peiris (00:54:16):
I think it's two [inaudible 00:54:17]. So one is, definitely the founders have this philosophy that unless you're doing something hard and new, it's kind of a waste of time. So, I think that also kind of runs through the culture. So, it's quite a rude awakening when people join Wise, because they're like, "Okay, I'm going to come, and just play around with a few things." You're like, "No, actually, the culture of the product team is we're super incentivized to do the hard things, and that's what's rewarded."

(00:54:46):
And that's quite hard to create the air cover. You can imagine like then in the early days and months when growth was slow, and people turned on the money taps in marketing, and you're trying to keep focused and plugging your away up these hard things, it's quite hard also to get the management cover in order to let the teams keep doing this. And then it's also hard just to turn up to work and really keep... You can imagine being in Singapore, verifying customers face-to face, thinking, "This is going nowhere, this is going nowhere, this is going nowhere." And then suddenly it changes. So that's what progress very much feels like at Wise. And we try to recognize that, and create a culture that enables that.

Lenny (00:55:21):
It feels like there's also just a lot of patience for these things. There isn't like, "We need to hit this quarterly goal. Why aren't we creating banks in Singapore yet?"

Nilan Peiris (00:55:29):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:55:31):
Awesome. The other kind of metaphor that's rolling around my head is something Seth Godin talks about. I don't know if you've heard of this guy, he's a marketing guru, and he has this concept that you want to build something that's remarkable, because if something is remarkable, it'll spread. And if you think about the word remarkable, it's something worth remarking about, which essentially is word of mouth.

Nilan Peiris (00:55:49):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:49):
And so that's his kind of mission and his, I don't know, advice to people is build something remarkable, something people will want to remark about. And clearly, you all have been doing that. And that's actually a good segue to where I wanted to go, which is around how you structure your team, and how you incentivize the team, organize teams, to achieve all these sorts of things. So, maybe just broadly, is there something unique to how you think about work structure, incentives, goals, things like that, in order to achieve these really hard things?

Nilan Peiris (00:56:17):
There's two unique lenses on this. One is in the macro-structure and one is in the micro-structure. So at the macro level, if you look at actually international banks, they don't really exist. I'm not sure if you've moved around between countries, but say you open a bank account with Citibank in the US, and then you go to Citibank in the UK, your Citibank account doesn't exist in the UK. You have to go to Citibank in the UK, and open a Citibank account. And actually, turns out, with some of these banks, to move money between your bank accounts is an international transfer. It's crazy.

(00:56:53):
So, when you take a step back, and look at how the market looks, you have at one end, international banks which are local tech stacks. So there's a core banking system in the US, and one in the UK, and one in Europe, say for Citibank, or for HSBC, but they have deep local integrations, so they're directly integrated in the payment system. Citibank in the US has got relationships, say, with the Federal Reserve, et cetera.

(00:57:20):
Other end of the spectrum you've got something like PayPal. So it's a tech company, it's got a single global tech stack. It doesn't run a additional version of PayPal in Australia than to the US, but it doesn't have deep connections. It hasn't got five central bank accounts, it hasn't got any of that. And I'd like to think of in the middle, you've got Wise, where we have a single global tech stack, and we have deep local infrastructure.

(00:57:45):
Now, from a technological perspective, just take a step back and think through this. This is actually non-trivial to figure out how to design. So, let's take something like the onboarding flow. So, we have global product teams, one part of product teams called global product teams. So we have a single onboarding flow that will give you a Wise account, and it's the same code that runs, whether you are in Brazil, New York, or Australia.

(00:58:17):
The regulation in Australia and Brazil is really different, and it isn't black and white in any country. So, there's a bunch of... You get a bunch of things you just shouldn't do in terms of letting people get so [inaudible 00:58:31] people who shouldn't get access to accounts. And then you can need to check these people aren't using it, and different jurisdictions have completely different requirements. Example is Japan, you have to take a picture of that front of the ID, the back of the ID, and the side of your ID. It's the only country in the world that you have to do this.

Lenny (00:58:47):
Wow.

Nilan Peiris (00:58:48):
And imagine you're the product manager for onboarding, and someone tells you, "Design the onboarding flow to give somebody a bank..." Just imagine gathering all the requirements from every country in the world, because there's very little similarity. You can't just say, "I take the US," and copy it somewhere else. It's very, very, very different.

(00:59:05):
It'd take forever to try to get that, and then normalize that into the main model, and try to figure out how you're going to structure the data around this. So, it then becomes like, what is the organization structure that enables us to discover what the domain model, let's call it that, for the onboarding flow should look like. And you end up with a global product team that owns overall KPIs around conversion rate, et cetera. And you have local, regional teams that own the conversion rate, and the cost to do KYC for their market, and they contribute to the global product code base.

(00:59:44):
So we have weak product ownership, where anyone can make code change, and pull requests, and these guys owning the vision in the center. But the only way that vision can evolve is by getting the feedback from these guys in the market, as they're constantly pushing stuff forward. And through that process, artifacts start emerging, where other markets are like Japan, and so you start splitting off that, and creating subtypes for it, and slowly the model emerges from there.

(01:00:09):
And so with this structure, the thing to optimize for is a really hard one. That problem that every global business has, is how do you get this collaboration to work between the local and the global? But unlike every other business, most businesses solve this probably as you know, is you usually have the US, and then you have international. And international is usually a bump site, where everyone's arguing to get their thing prioritized, right?

Lenny (01:00:29):
That's right.

Nilan Peiris (01:00:30):
Whereas here, you're kind of letting the local teams commit directly to the code base, and then this global team's got this challenge of doing this, and we over time create sub-teams around parts of the regionalization of the structure, around different objects as they emerge. But that broadly speaking is the first problem, the global problem. And the other bit with us is this is quite unique to us, because most fintechs out there are usually in one market. Like you take Robin Hood, it was in the US, it came to the UK, they went back to the US. You take Monzo, only the UK, N26 only in Europe, Up in Australia, China, and the US. And that's because their home markets are so big, and one regulator is a ton of work to manage. And the second complexity we have is we have all of these markets we have to be in, because we're international by default. So a lot of our thinking is where do we take that, turn that into competitive advantage, and which customer base really needs that? Which is what zooms us into that positioning on the international account.

Lenny (01:01:32):
It just comes back to again, and again, again and again, doing the hard thing, knocking peoples' socks off, and it feels like that's the formula for Wise.

Nilan Peiris (01:01:41):
I think yeah, you more or less got it. So that's one bit on structure. So this global local thing, and the second one has been a bit more of a journey. So when we started early on, we ran in autonomous independent teams, all focused on KPIs, and these KPIs rolled up to make it cheaper, make it faster, make it easier to use. You can imagine like a KPI tree, and teams around bits of their KPIs, and every quarter they talk through how they move their KPI, et cetera, and this kind of worked. And the way we ran our planning is, every quarter every team would stand up and talk through its plan, get feedback from other teams, and then move on. This worked till we got to 30 teams, and then you go from doing this in the afternoon, to doing it in two days and it's just like whoa.

(01:02:27):
So, we started heading towards the Spotify model, where we group the teams in squads, and into tribes. Today, I think that autonomy is at the squad level. So the squads are around products. So, we'll have a Wise account squad, a business squad, a Wise platform, our enterprise product squad, you'll have a North Am squad that looks after the North American product, and Lat Am squad, et cetera. And then financial crime fighting, et cetera.

(01:02:57):
And inside those squads you've got the teams, and the squad... Imagine you're the director for the Wise account, but you don't have a vision for the account. You've got to say where it's going. You've got to keep your teams on track against it. The teams aren't off doing whatever they want. They kind of need to be on track, versus the overall vision, and you're accountable for the results of that squad. And squads are in tribes, the tribe provides overall leadership, and a slight, light touch strategy on the squads. And that's more or less our structure, and how we've evolved towards it.

Lenny (01:03:26):
Is there anything else along the word of mouth concept that you think would be useful for people to share? Either how you think about it, team structure, anything else?

Nilan Peiris (01:03:34):
There's one tiny bit I'll share, which was around marketing and referral. This was super interesting for me. So, we've been running it, like Airbnb, we've been running referral program for now 12 years, and after 12 years, you've kind of tested everything anyway. And like I said, by this point you have literally tested everything. So when somebody comes up with something that has a 300% increase, you're like, "Whoa, that's super interesting. What just happened?"

Lenny (01:04:03):
Wow, I'm excited for this.

Nilan Peiris (01:04:05):
And yeah, I'll share this one, because it's interesting. So we run many variants of refer a friend, where you'll get different kinds of benefit. We tried chocolate, we tried money, we've tried $200, $500, $10, you get some, I get some money, all kinds of things. More or less headed towards three for $100, generally it's a sweet spot. Anyway, it's a pretty creative PM there. And he was again talking to customers, and he spotted this thing, which is pretty cool, which is when you do a transfer with Wise, at the end you get this email, the email says, "Well done." Then it says, "Your money's there in the other person's account, and you saved $10 on this transfer." And he got this insight, which was pretty awesome, was he realized that people believed they saved money, but they didn't believe the number. And he then thought, what would it take to get them to believe the number?

Lenny (01:05:05):
That seems right.

Nilan Peiris (01:05:07):
And so the fun bit was the approach. So then him and a designer sat there and they sketched out an alternative email, and they went down to the coffee shop downstairs, and they showed it to people, and they said... Just asked them what they thought, and they kept iterating it until they got to a graph. And this graph is like this... When you go through a money transfer thing, it pops up in places, behind the compare button. And this graph shows with your bank, when you send, how much is in the rate hidden as... This is how much you're sending, this is how much they're taking in the rate in a fee, and this is how much you can see in the fee, because the fees are hidden in the rates with banks. And then this is with Wise.

(01:05:45):
And they iterate this graph to the point that people looked at like, "Oh my God, I'm never using my bank again. This number... This is crazy." And then they put this graph on the success page when you did a transfer. Saying, "You saved this." And put a share button in there, and invite your friends button, and that's what really drove it. And when you fast-forward to today, we've now got... So it's actually quite hard. So, we now have I think about 70 bank accounts around the world. So, I think the top three accounts, banks in the world, where we log onto every day, and then we log the price and the quote for a bunch of different routes into a file. You can imagine how hard is. I think I personally have about 17 of these still in my name, that I've opened up around the world to help the team get going. But that's kind of one of the biggest word of mouth growth, or referral insights. I've got to this comparison thing, made into our marketing, made into our homepage, just went everywhere up from that insight.

Lenny (01:06:46):
And you said that that like 3x'd the sharing rate?

Nilan Peiris (01:06:50):
Yeah, that 3x'd the sharing rate. So we always had the share button after you completed a transfer. But putting that there with this graph, and that kind of got me to this, I'm curious on your take on this, on this definition of product marketing, where customers use the product, and they think they got this value, but when they actually know the value they get. So we got this on speed as well, where we're doing instant transfers, and customers wouldn't know it was instant.

(01:07:21):
So when you get an instant transfer, there's like this wizzy animation at the end, and you kind of know the money's in the other person's account, ready to spend. And again, you see this big jump in referral rate when that happens, but people need to know it's happened. And closing this delta between what you've done, and what's perceived to be done is what I call product marketing within the product. And that in its own right is a discipline, I've learned.

Lenny (01:07:43):
That's an awesome insight. It comes back to this framework we talked about of reality and perception, in a flip way, instead of getting people to adopt something, it's to appreciate the work you've done to make it remarkable, to make them understand how remarkable it really is.

Nilan Peiris (01:07:56):
Yeah, that was it. And that's something I'm continuously learning about yeah, as we go, as well.

Lenny (01:08:01):
That is extremely interesting. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I know you also do a bunch of charity work, and I wanted to give you a chance to share what you're doing there.

Nilan Peiris (01:08:12):
Thanks, Lenny. So, less charity, essentially came out of angel investing, is probably the way to say it. So I invest in startups, generally fintechs, mission led founders, word of mouth type stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about, that I'm passionate about. It is less investing, more helping, and yeah, just getting through the angel route. And then over time, I realized the thing I'm most passionate about is market failures. So generally I find that the invisible hand means most human needs get fulfilled by the market, but there are a few things that don't, and there's a couple of exciting startups out there who work really hard in this space. A couple are Beam in the UK, working on homelessness, Affinity and Neobank in Ghana. And so, this type of thing is stuff I'm most passionate about. So, if any of your listeners out there know anyone doing anything of that kind, trying to solve these kinds of hard problems, definitely reach out, always keen to talk.

Lenny (01:09:14):
Awesome. And we'll link to those two you mentioned in the show notes just in case people want to check them out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nilan Peiris (01:09:22):
Let's go for it.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Nilan Peiris (01:09:29):
Two, one's at the other ends of the spectrum. So one is... This sounds terribly pretentious Crime and Punishment, and the other one is Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie. I read a lot, I'm very passionate about reading, fiction, mainly. I don't read... Nonfiction is too much like work. And so, I generally need to read before I go to bed to decompress my brain. It's generally escapist type stuff. But I'm curious what you think of this, but for me authors are people that create people with words.

(01:10:03):
Like you say artist is a good artists if it's... Makes a good likeness to somebody, but imagine that you create somebody with words, and that person feels real, so they have some insight into the human condition. And what's amazing is if you learn something about what it means to be human from reading that. So at that end of the scale, Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment, where this guy kills somebody, and it just eats him up. It's a pretty amazing book. It's not as heavy as it sounds, but books like that are pretty awesome. So, I recommend that a lot.

(01:10:37):
And the other end of the scale is sometimes you read a book and there's a single sentence where each word has been just stitched together, and it's like, again, a work of art, and there, Rushdie is probably the pinnacle for me, of Midnight's Children, which is about partition in India, which is pretty... Through a metaphor, it's pretty amazing.

Lenny (01:10:57):
It's a beautiful answer. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nilan Peiris (01:11:02):
Oh gosh, I am not... I don't love [inaudible 01:11:05] got TV, but we had rented Barbie for the kids. That one, probably the last movie.

Lenny (01:11:12):
I just watched that too. So good.

Nilan Peiris (01:11:13):
Good.

Lenny (01:11:15):
You can actually stream it now. I don't know when this comes out, but it just-

Nilan Peiris (01:11:17):
Oh wow.

Lenny (01:11:18):
Yeah, you can watch it at home. But it's not cheap. I think it's like 20 bucks in the US.

Nilan Peiris (01:11:23):
Oh geez.

Lenny (01:11:24):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Nilan Peiris (01:11:28):
Yeah, so I only ask two. I got down to asking just two questions over time. The first one's probably my favorite, which is, what is it that most frustrates you about... Instead of why you're leaving, what frustrates you the most about where you're working right now? And this is as people always tell you why they want to join Wise, or join whatever company you're coming to, and that's not that interesting. But what's interesting, trying to figure out, is what they're running away from. And usually there's something broken there, that's really wound them up. But what's more interesting is they've been unable to fix it. And so, in asking this question, and probing, you kind of get quite good at getting a sense of what is their limit, what's the thing they found, and what did they get stuck with? And you kind of think, "Okay, you're going to run into that here every day, every week? Or... You should be fine." And that's kind of why I ask that question.

Lenny (01:12:24):
I love that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Nilan Peiris (01:12:29):
I recently switched to Arc Browser.

Lenny (01:12:29):
That's what I use.

Nilan Peiris (01:12:35):
And yeah, the onboarding flow was mind-blowingly good.

Lenny (01:12:37):
That's exactly how I felt. I had to tweet about it. It's like, [inaudible 01:12:41].

Nilan Peiris (01:12:40):
Yeah, I sent it to my onboarding team, and everyone. And what I loved about it is, it's clearly like if you could try to use Arc with the same way you use Chrome, you just get really frustrated. But if you use it the way they want you to use, it'd be amazing. So, for figuring out how to get people to engage with, you need to use this fundamentally differently. They manage to almost get me to use it the right way. Still struggling a little bit with it, but that I thought was really clever.

Lenny (01:13:12):
Awesome choice. We had Josh, the CEO of the Browser Company of New York, it's called, on the podcast. And if you're interested in learning about Arc's story, definitely check out that episode. All right, next question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat most to yourself, that you like to share? Anything come to mind?

Nilan Peiris (01:13:30):
The thing that defines success is the speed at which you pick yourself up.

Lenny (01:13:37):
I love that.

Nilan Peiris (01:13:37):
And that's the thing that I hold onto most, because you get knocked a lot, high growth company, and it's obviously quite... Obviously knocks you, when someone says no to an offer, when somebody leaves the company, when a product doesn't work as you think it should, when you get pushback from a partner. But yeah, if you lose four hours spinning around it, or you trying and figure out, "Okay, this happened, how do I move forward?" And just learning how to shorten that time has probably been one of the most important journeys for me.

Lenny (01:14:11):
That was an awesome answer. One final question, is there a fun cultural ritual at Wise that has stuck around for a while?

Nilan Peiris (01:14:20):
This one, my team would love to say. So, from the early days, we got everyone together from all around the world once a year. Oh, I actually did it twice a year. And the founders are from Estonia, and we have 5,000 people now, so we still have about 1,800 in Estonia. So it's cheaper to flavor on Estonia. So in the old days when it was winter, winter in Estonia is not fun, but summer in Estonia is amazing, and we still do this. And the funnest bit about this is, I have a side hustle, DJ, so I get to DJ there, and it's quite fun, and embarrassing for my kids because technically I've now DJ'd in other countries.

Lenny (01:15:03):
International DJ.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:05):
That's it. That's my side hustle.

Lenny (01:15:07):
Amazing.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:08):
That's how I introduced myself to my 17-year old's friends. So, yeah.

Lenny (01:15:12):
Do you have a DJ name? Is there... Can we check you out on Spotify?

Nilan Peiris (01:15:15):
No, no, you can't check me on Spotify or anything, but yeah, it's all private. [inaudible 01:15:19].

Lenny (01:15:19):
All right. Maybe Burning Man, you could see your performance next year.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:23):
Maybe.

Lenny (01:15:24):
Nilan, thank you so much for being here. We talked a lot about word of mouth. I feel like this episode is going to spread 100% through word of mouth. Can't wait for people to listen to it. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nilan Peiris (01:15:37):
You can find me online on Twitter, nilanp, and always love to hear product feedback by email, by tweet, by LinkedIn. Generally by tweet is best, easiest for me to pick up, and my team to reach into directly. So, hit me up that way. And most useful for me, yeah, product feedback, and as I said, other people working on hard problems that need help, do reach out.

Lenny (01:16:03):
Amazing. Nilan, thank you so much for being here.

Nilan Peiris (01:16:06):
Thank you for your time. Take care, Lenny.

# Strategies for becoming less distractible and improving focus | Nir Eyal

## Transcript

Nir Eyal (00:00:00):
I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection. And then I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff. And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions.

(00:00:51):
It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

Lenny (00:01:10):

(00:04:24):
Nir, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nir Eyal (00:04:27):
Thanks so much, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:29):
I feel like we have a chance to record the most valuable hour in podcast history because it could give people more time to do the things they want to do. And this is based on a book that you wrote. It's called Indistractable, which is all about helping people become less distracted, become better at focus, and it might be the most essential skill in the workplace today. And so, what I'm hoping to do today in our chat is just basically give people as many tactical skills and pieces of advice and tools to become less distractable and to get better at focus. How does that sound?

Nir Eyal (00:04:59):
That sounds great. I love that you're setting the expectations high. I'll try and meet them.

Lenny (00:05:03):
Well now, we got to hit them. Okay, so here's the question. I'll just start really broad and let's just see where this goes. My question is just how does one become less distractable, slash how do I become less distractable?

Nir Eyal (00:05:15):
Okay, so there's a deeper motivation here. It's like, "I need help," which is great. That's my favorite thing to do, is to actually get concrete with people about what their specific challenges are. But let me back up here. So, this is what I spent five years writing a book about, because why did it take me five years to write a book? Because I was so distracted. So, I wrote this book for me more than anyone else. That's the only reason I write books. It's not because of what I know, but because of what I want to know. And I discovered that there were so many myths and tropes and just flat out harmful things that I was doing to hurt my own productivity. And when I really went down to first principles and looked at the research, I found that there were so many things that I was doing wrong.

(00:05:56):
But since I've changed my ways and adopted what the research literature says about distraction, it's improved my life in inconceivable ways. I'm in the best shape of my life at 45 years old. I have a better relationship with my family than ever. I'm more productive at work than ever before, not because I didn't know what to do. That's what I find is really emblematic of people today is not that we don't know what to do. It used to be maybe, okay, our grandparents, they didn't know what to do because the information was scarce. They had to go to the library and look things up. Well, today, with the internet, we all basically know what to do. And if you don't know what to do, Google it. You can find the answer out there. But we all basically know common-sense stuff like if you want to get in shape, you have to exercise and eat right, okay?

(00:06:38):
You don't need a diet book to tell you that. If you want to have better relationships with your family, you have to be fully present with people. If you want to do better at work, you have to do the hard work that other people don't want to do. We already know these things. What we don't know is how to get out of our own way, how to stop getting distracted. And so, that was certainly my problem. And so, what I wanted to do was really dive into the problem because the conventional solutions didn't work for me. When I have a problem in my life, I'll think about it, I'll write about it, I'll talk to friends, I'll talk to my wife about it. If I still can't figure it out, I'll read books about it. And what the conventional wisdom out there written by a lot of college professors that are all tenured is stop using technology, stop checking email, get off social media. It's melting your brain, but that's not very helpful, right?

(00:07:23):
Maybe if you have tenure, that's okay, but I can't stop using technology. My career will plummet. I have to use these tools. So, I wanted much more practical advice, and what I discovered was that the root cause of distraction is much more interesting and the solution is far more empowering than stop using technology, technology's evil, it's melting your brain. So, where do we begin? Maybe the best place to start is by first, before we dive into the tactics around how do we become indistractable, the first place to start is what is distraction? Understanding the term really, really matters. And the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand what distraction is not. What's the opposite of distraction? So, if you ask most people, what's the opposite of distraction?

(00:08:06):
They'll tell you focus, right? I don't want to be distracted, I want to be focused. That's not exactly right. Then in fact, the opposite of distraction is not focus. The opposite of distraction is traction. Becomes pretty easy when you look at both words, traction, distraction. They're opposites because both words come from the same Latin root, trahare, which means to pull, and they both end in the same six letters, A-C-T-I-O-N that spells action, reminding us that distraction is not something that happens to us. It is an action that we ourselves take. So, traction, by definition, is any action that pulls you towards what you say you were going to do, things you do with intent, things that move you closer to your values, and help you become the kind of person you want to become. Those are acts of traction. Now, the opposite of traction, distraction, is any action that pulls you away from what you plan to do, further away from your goals, further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.

(00:09:01):
And what separates traction from distraction is one word, and that one word is intent. I love this Dorothy Parker. She said, "The time you plan to waste is not wasted time." So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction. So, what I discovered, for me, was that I was getting tricked by distraction in that the most pernicious form of distraction I discovered was the kind I didn't even realize was distracting me.

(00:09:53):
So, let me know if this sounds familiar to you, Lenny. I would sit down at my desk. I would look at my to-do list. By the way, we can talk about why to-do lists are one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity. We can get back to that later. But I would sit down at my desk and I'd say, "Okay, I've got that big important project. That's what I'm going to do this morning. I'm not going to get distracted, nothing's going to get in my way. Here I go, I'm going to get started, but first let me check some email."

Lenny (00:10:17):
Are you watching me because this happens to me every morning. You got to stop.

Nir Eyal (00:10:21):
This is totally autobiographical. This is what I used to do all the... "Oh, let me just scroll that Slack channel. What's everybody at the office doing? Oh, let me just catch up on industry news." That's important. That's part of my job. I'm being productive, right? And what I didn't realize is that distraction was tricking me into prioritizing the urgent and the easy stuff at the expense of the hard and important work I had to do to move my life and career forward. So, just because it's a work-related task, doesn't mean it's not a distraction. In fact, that's the worst kind of distraction. Far worse than playing Candy Crush or whatever because then you're putzing around, then at least it's obvious that you're distracted. But if you're just checking work email, you feel productive even though that's a distraction because it's not what you said you want to do with your time and attention. So now, we have this framework. We have traction, we have distraction.

(00:11:08):
Now, there's one more thing that's super important, then we'll have the entire picture so that we can stop thinking about the model and actually get to a brass tacks of what do we actually do. Now that we have traction distraction the other thing we have to consider are triggers. We have two kinds of triggers. We have external triggers. These are things in our outside environment, the usual suspects, the pings, the dings, the rings, all this stuff in our outside environment, which we tend to blame for distraction, but studies find, that's only 10% of the reason we get distracted, 10% of the time it's because of something outside of us. What's the other 90%? Turns out 90% of the time that we get distracted, it's not because of what's happening outside of us, but that most distraction begins from within boredom, loneliness, fatigue, uncertainty, anxiety. That is the cause of 90% of our distractions. So, whether it's too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much Facebook, you are always going to get distracted from one thing or another unless you understand the root cause of the problem.

(00:12:09):
So, step number one to becoming indistractable is to master those internal triggers or they will become your master. Now, we're working around those four points. Step number two, make time for traction. We can talk about that. Hack back the external triggers and step number four, prevent distraction with pacts. So, you asked a big question, I gave you a big answer. That's the overall framework. That's a strategy. Tactics are what you do. Strategy is why you do it. So, I wanted to explain the strategy before we got into the tactics.

Lenny (00:12:36):
Amazing. I love this word traction because it relates to kind of the other side of this podcast of growth, product market fit, building products people want, getting traction with users. So, I really like that there's this additional way of thinking about traction, which is basically not being distracted. Can you just repeat the four steps again for people to have this in mind?

Nir Eyal (00:12:55):
Step number one, master internal triggers. Step number two, make time for traction. So, this is where we're turning our values into time. We can talk about how to do that. Step number three is hack back the external triggers. This is where we get into the pings, dings, and rings, not just the obvious stuff like your phone, your computer. I take about a page and a half to talk about that. That's kind of kindergarten stuff. But what about all the non-obvious external triggers? What about stupid meetings that didn't need to be called? What about emails that didn't need to be sent and received? What about our kids? Our kids are wonderful. I know you're a new dad, they're fantastic to have kids, but they can also be a source of distraction. So, how do we deal with all those external triggers, and then finally prevent distraction with pacts and pacts are this firewall, this last resort against distraction that we can use to keep distraction at bay and it's really about these four steps in concert in this order that anyone can use to become indistractable.

Lenny (00:13:47):
Awesome. Does this spell something clever, by the way?

Nir Eyal (00:13:49):
No, I didn't have an acronym, but I do have a pretty picture.

Lenny (00:13:53):
Awesome. So, let's go through this and I'd love specifically example you shared, I think many people run into this. There's a hard thing I need to do and I'm just going to go check my email and Twitter instead. I feel like that's a very common distraction, and so sharing, getting into that at some point would be awesome, but otherwise let's get into these four steps.

Nir Eyal (00:14:09):
Yeah, well, we can absolutely do that. So, is that something you encounter? It sounds like a...

Lenny (00:14:13):
100%. Every time. I have my to-do list, work on next week's post, and then I'm like, "Oh, let me just go check Twitter or maybe tweet something and that'll be fun," and then totally check my email. "Oh, inbox zero. Let's get all the way to zero. Oh, that's cool. Okay, now the days are over."

Nir Eyal (00:14:28):
Exactly. And by the way, we are cut from the same cloth. This is exactly the pattern I used to get into and I knew I wasn't doing my best because I wasn't putting in the time to the things that were most important. I was doing just what was easy and what was urgent and that's not good enough. So, if we use this model, step number one is master the internal triggers. So, for you, Lenny, so when you say, "Okay, I know I've got to do this big important thing, but now I'm going to go check email," I would guess that there's some kind of underlying emotion that you're trying to escape. Let's put yourself in the shoes that you were in when you said, "I was going to do that big important thing, but now I'm going to check email instead." Do you remember the last time that happened, by the way?

Lenny (00:15:11):
Every morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:13):
Every morning. This morning?

Lenny (00:15:15):
Yeah, this morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:16):
Okay, perfect. Do you recall what you were feeling right before you went to Twitter or checked email or did the thing that you didn't want to do as opposed to the thing you said you were going to do?

Lenny (00:15:27):
I don't know if this is an emotion or feeling, but there's just this, I need to get serious and start using my brain and there's going to be this deep work moment where I just get real deep and it takes a lot of effort to push me into that. Sometimes easier, sometimes harder. So, maybe it's avoiding this, "Oh, okay, I'm going to really have to think." It's like, I guess, it's the fear of the brain starting to really have to work.

Nir Eyal (00:15:51):
Yeah, that's hard work. So maybe, it's a bit of laziness. Maybe, it's a bit of momentum. There's this uncomfortable feeling of this cold start problem. "Oh, I don't really want to do it right now." So, this is incredibly important and I appreciate your candor here around what you feel because all of us experience it and we don't want to talk about it. We want to think that it's, "Oh, I'll just grayscale my phone," or, "I'll just turn off notifications and that's going to solve the problem," and it never does. And let me tell you, I tried all of it. I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection, and then I got myself a word processor off of eBay, so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff.

(00:16:33):
And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions. It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

(00:17:27):
So, let me give you one tool that I use every single day. Feel free to use it next time you feel this same problem. It's called the 10-minute rule, and this is just one of a dozen different techniques that you can use that I put in the book, but this is one that I use almost every single day. So, for me, I've been a professional writer now for over a decade, and writing is never easy. I hear people say like, "Oh, just form a writing habit." I think that's ridiculous. I don't know what they're talking about. A habit is defined as a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. I don't know how to write out of habit. Writing is always hard. Fricking work. I've written two bestsellers, thousands of articles and let me tell you, it's always difficult. It's hard, and all I want to do when I write is just Google this one thing or let me just check the news real quick or let me just do anything but the actual writing. So, here's what I do.

Lenny (00:18:15):
By the way, there's a great quote that I'll share real quick about this that I think I share often on this podcast that I think it's falsely attributed to Hemingway, but it's that, "Writing is easy. Just sit down at the keyboard and bleed."

Nir Eyal (00:18:27):
Oh my God, that's so true. It's so true, and I've not figured out how to make it suddenly easy. Every single word is hard to type out, but I got to do it right and I love doing it. I love having done it. In the process, it's very difficult. But after I make the discovery, after I create something that I think is useful, then it's a lot of fun. But doing the work is really difficult. So, here's what I do. Every time that I am tempted to go do something else, which is all the time, what I will do is I will take out a timer, I'll take out my phone and I'll say, "Set a timer for 10 minutes." I'll put the phone down and my job is for those 10 minutes, whenever I'm ready, get back to the task at hand or do what's called surf the urge.

(00:19:12):
Surfing the urge acknowledges that these emotions are like waves. They crest and then they subside. But that's not how we think about emotions. Most of us think about emotions as always being there. If I feel bored, I feel like I'm always going to be bored. If I'm frustrated, it feels like I'm always going to be frustrated, but that's never the case. Emotions are like waves. So, your job is to set that timer for 10 minutes and realize you can do just about anything for just 10 minutes. So, the idea is not to say don't do it. We know that this technique that a lot of people use of abstinence, telling yourself, "Don't do that, that's bad," actually can backfire. And we can talk about the psychology if that's interesting of why abstinence backfires. But a much healthier technique is not to tell yourself no. It's to tell yourself not yet.

(00:19:57):
You're not saying no, you're saying not yet. And so, you can do just about anything for 10 minutes. So, what I tell myself is, "Okay, I'm just going to wait 10 minutes before I check email, before I scroll social media, before I Google something that is just trying to procrastinate doing the work." I can do that. I'm a grown man. I can do whatever I want. I can do that in 10 minutes. And so, for those 10 minutes, all I have to do is either get back to the task at hand, get back to writing, or surf the urge, which is simply experiencing that sensation, acknowledging, "You know what? This is hard work. That's okay. That's why I'm feeling frustrated. That's why I'm feeling bored. That's why I'm feeling anxious. That's why I have this cold start around I don't really want to do this work because it's difficult."

(00:20:34):
So, what I do is I take a deep breath and I repeat a mantra that I made up for myself. You can make up your own mantra. My personal mantra whenever I feel this internal trigger is I remind myself this. I say, "This is what it feels like to get better. This is what it feels like to get better." And just saying that for as long as I need to until that emotion crests and subsides and then get back to work. What you'll find nine times out of 10 is that by the time those 10 minutes are up, you will have forgotten about that sensation. You'll be right back at the task at hand. And so, that's what's called the 10-minute rule. And of course what you're doing over time is that the 10-minute rule can become the 12-minute rule, can become the 20-minute rule, and most importantly, you are proving to yourself that you have agency that you said you were going to focus on a task and you did. That's the most important part.

(00:21:22):
The flip that we need to change in people's minds is this ridiculous belief that technology is hijacking our brains. There's nothing we can do about distraction that our focus is being stolen. It's not being stolen, we're giving it away. And so, what we need to do is to empower ourselves by showing ourselves in practice as well as in theory that we can postpone that distraction when we say we will.

Lenny (00:21:46):
What I like about this is one, it's kind of like the Pomodoro technique, but it's shorter. The 10 minutes I think is a really clever tweak versus 20 minutes, which a lot of people recommend. And then I guess a couple of follow-up questions. Do you do this one time in the morning and then not come back to it? Is this like a jump start for the day and then you start... If I start a thing like this, it won't be 10 minutes, it'll be like an hour because I'm like, "Okay, I did the hard thing, I'm into it. I'm just going to keep working." So, is this like a jump start for the morning or do you come back to this throughout the day?

Nir Eyal (00:22:13):
So, you can do it whenever you find yourself slipping off track. And so, the Pomodoro is a version of this. I don't think it's complete enough because Pomodoro just said, "Set the timer, do it." Okay, fine. And that's great if it works for you. By the way, anything I'm saying right now, if the thing is working for you, if your life is awesome and you're doing what you said you're going to do, maybe this isn't the podcast. Maybe my book isn't the book for you, right? I'm talking to the people who, for whatever reason, you know you're capable of more, you know you're drifting off track. Maybe if like me, you said you were going to exercise but you didn't or you said you're going to eat right, but you don't. You said you were going to work on that big task, but you procrastinate. That's really who I was and that's who I wrote this book for.

(00:22:49):
And so, you can use that technique whenever you get distracted. It's not the whole picture. So, it's super important. Remember we talked about those four steps. This is just step number one. There's about a dozen different things you can do. Maybe this particular 10-minute rule doesn't work for you, doesn't work for everyone. There might be other techniques you use. So, there's dozens of different techniques just about this step around mastering internal triggers. But the next step to answer your question of well, how long do I go for? Do I do it for an hour? If now, I'm in the zone? And my answer is emphatically no. You don't go as long as you think you can. What you want to do, and this is step number two, is you're making time for traction by turning your values into time, which means you are going to make a time box schedule because you cannot call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from.

(00:23:39):
I'll say that again. You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from. So, for me, at least, when I would succumb to, "Oh, let me just check email for a quick minute, let me just see what's happening on Twitter for a quick minute," part of that was because I would justify to myself, "Well, this is a work-related task. I got to do it sometime," and there wasn't a specific time to do it on my calendar, so I would keep thinking, "Well, I got to do it sometime. Might as well just do it now." And that's a huge mistake because if you can't look at your calendar and say, "Oh, that's traction." Okay, check email, write the blog post, post the podcast, go on social media. If that's not what's written in your calendar, if it's not there, it's a distraction. And so, it's not just work-related stuff. I literally have time in my calendar, spend time with my daughter, go on social media, watch Netflix. It's in my calendar. So now, I took what was previously distraction and I turned it into traction by putting it on my schedule.

Lenny (00:24:37):
So, you actually do this through the day you have, "I'm going to check Twitter during this time of the day, I'm going to hang out with my daughter during this time of the day."

Nir Eyal (00:24:44):
Exactly. And you're adjusting it never in the day. So, you never want to do that. You always want to make sure you're doing it the day before. And so, what I do once a week, Sunday evenings, it takes me maybe 10 minutes a week. 8:00 P.M., I sit down, I look at my schedule for the week ahead and I ask myself, "Does this schedule reflect my values?" What are values? Values are attributes of the person you want to become. I'll say it again. Values are attributes of the person you want to become. So, there's three life domains, you, your relationships, and finally your work. So, what you got to do is you look at your calendar for the week ahead and you ask yourself, "How would the person I want to become spend time taking care of themselves?" That's the you domain. If you can't take care of yourself, you can't take care of others, you can't make the world a better place.

(00:25:26):
So then, you put in your calendar how you want to take care of yourself. What might that include? Well, time for rest. We all know how important sleep is, but I used to yell at my daughter and say, "Oh, it's your bedtime. You got to get to bed." And then one day she said to me, "Daddy, do you have a bedtime?" She was absolutely right. I was a hypocrite because I know how important sleep is and I didn't have a bedtime. Now, I have a bedtime. It's in my schedule. Then put in time for whatever else is important to you. Is reading important to you? Is prayer important to you? Is meditation, is exercise, is video games, is that important to you? Great. Whatever's important to you according to your values, put it in your schedule. Then you're going to put your relationships in. So, don't let the relationships in your life get whatever scraps of time are left over.

(00:26:08):
Put time in your schedule for your significant other, for your kids, for your buddies. How many of us are trapped in this loneliness epidemic because we don't make time for our closest relationships, including adult friendships? Don't let those wither away. Put time in your schedule for those, as well. We know that most friendships, they don't die in some big blowout. Relationships starve to death because we don't invest in them. Put time in your schedule for those relationships. We can talk about how to do that, as well. Then finally, the work domain involves two kinds of work. We have what's called reactive work and reflective work. Reactive work, reacting to notifications, reacting to emails, reacting to taps on the shoulder from your colleagues. That's going to be part of everybody's day. I get that, but don't let that be your entire day because what most people do, they habituate into not wanting to think.

(00:26:56):
They don't want to think what's important. "So, just let me look at my email inbox. My email inbox will tell me what to do. What's really important for my business? That's really hard. I don't really want to think about that. I'll look at my to-do list and I'll start ticking off easy tasks to do that make me feel productive." That's terrible. What you want to do instead is to book time in your schedule for this reflective work time, which is where you do the kind of work that requires you to work without distraction. Planning, strategizing, thinking, for god's sakes, can only be done without distraction. So, that fills up your calendar, as well. And what you're going to find, that there's never enough time for everything, which is good because what this forces you to do, and this is one of the main reasons why to-do lists suck, is because to-do lists have no constraints.

(00:27:38):
You can always add more to a to-do list. You can always add more, but here's what happens. This is what happened to me. I would get home from work. I have a very busy day and I'd look at my to-do list and it's a hundred items long and I think, "Wow, I've been working real hard all day and look at all this stuff I still didn't do. Loser." And so, day after day, week after week, month after month, I was reinforcing this self-image as someone who doesn't know how to manage their time. And then I started saying stupid stuff like, "Oh, maybe I'm no good at time management. Maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Maybe there's something wrong with me." There's nothing wrong with me. There's something wrong with this very stupid to-do list method, which doesn't force you to understand that there are trade-offs that you have to prioritize properly and that can only be done with constraints and that constraints come from your calendar.

(00:28:23):
So, you're turning your values into time by making time for traction and having this calendar and then, only then you can look at your calendar and say, "Ah, whatever it is I plan to do, that's traction. Everything else is distraction."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I want to share a couple things that worked for me that are very much along these lines. One is booking. I call it deep work time within the day. This was the only thing I had in the calendar, so I didn't do the other things, which I think would've been really helpful, but I had a, I called it deep work time. I will slap you if you book anything over this meeting.

Nir Eyal (00:28:36):
I love it.

Lenny (00:28:55):
And I did that every Monday morning, Wednesday morning, and Friday sometime, and on that...

Nir Eyal (00:28:59):
Who was slapping you?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I would be slapping the person that booked time over that slot and nobody can...

Nir Eyal (00:29:05):
Okay, got it.

Lenny (00:29:06):
And I don't know if that's allowed these days. I don't know how this...

Nir Eyal (00:29:10):
Depends who you're booking with, I guess.

Lenny (00:29:11):
Yeah, make it a little less aggressive maybe. But that worked a ton. It was like a two- or three-hour block of deep work time and that made a big dent in my ability to have time to focus because people weren't booking me as a PM.

Nir Eyal (00:29:23):
Yeah, I love it. And by the way, I want to hear more of these, but that illustrates a really good point that when the stakes are high enough, I hear people a lot of times saying, "I just can't find the time to focus and I can't get this done and it's impossible these days." And then I say, "Well, let's make a little wager here." Let's say, I get this around physical fitness a lot or somebody says, "Oh, I want to be an author. How do I do that? How do I write the book? I can't seem to find the time." And they constantly say why They can't, they can't, they can't. "There's this constraint. My boss wants this. My kids want that." They have every kind of excuse. And then I say, "Okay, let's say that if you don't work out, 8:00 A.M. Monday morning, if you don't work out, you're going to have to pay me $10,000. Are you going to do it? Are you going to work out?"

(00:30:03):
"Well, of course, I'm going to work out. Easily. Yes, of course." Okay, so we've established you can. Now, we're just negotiating the price. So, this has to do with step four around making pacts, making what's called a pre-commitment, and one of them is a price pact. This is how I got in shape. I used to be clinically obese. Today, I'm in the best shape of my life, partially because I use these pacts. Now, the important thing is you have to do this last. If you don't figure out the internal triggers, most importantly, if you don't make time for traction in your schedule, if you don't hack back the external triggers, this fourth step won't work. But as the last line of defense, it's incredibly impactful and we can talk about how to do that, as well.

Lenny (00:30:39):
I heard the all-in guys did this to lose weight. I think Sax and Jason did a pact, too. I think it was a lot of money, a hundred thousand dollars or something wild for...

Nir Eyal (00:30:49):
Oh, that's awesome. Actually, that's what I used to finish this book, as well. Maybe they read my book, I wonder, because I talked about this exact situation.

Lenny (00:30:55):
You hit it. It sounds like. You made it.

Nir Eyal (00:30:57):
I did? Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:00):
Another trick I'll share that I found useful around the to-do list. So, I used to-do lists, but I've learned that I can't just let them grow is when I had a regular job. I wrote it down in a notebook and every morning, I rewrote the to-do list so that it reminded me like, "Okay, I've copied this thing 10 times now. I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to push it out." So, that act of just rethinking about it every day was really impactful. But that works for people that are okay with an analog to-do list. If it's digital, that doesn't go away.

Nir Eyal (00:31:29):
So, I just want to clarify, there's nothing wrong with taking things out of your brain and putting them on a piece of paper. That's wonderful, but that's step one. And so, the big mistake that people make is they put stuff on their to-do list and then they wake up in the morning and what are they supposed to do? "Well, I'll do whatever's on my to-do list." And so, what they tend to do is the easy stuff. I've known people, I hate to tell you, I used to do this myself, too. I would do a task and then forget to put it on my to-do list. So, I would go back in and write it on my to-do list just so I could check off the box. How messed up is that? It's ridiculous. And I think this is something that I think really does need to change is that we have this culture where checking stuff off your list is our little emotional reward, right?

(00:32:12):
But that's ridiculous. We need to stop measuring ourselves by how many cute little boxes we check off. And rather, a much more important metric is not, "Did I finish the task?" I don't want you to track, "Did I finish?" That's not the important part, but people are probably scratching their heads. What do you mean? Isn't it all about finishing what I have to do? No, the important part is figuring out your productivity. It's figuring out how efficient you are at using your time. So, a much more beneficial metric to track is not, "Did I check off the box? Did I finish?" Rather, it's, "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?" I'll say it again. "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?"

(00:32:53):
Because that is the only way to understand how long things take you. The problem with to-do lists is that there is no feedback loop, there's no feedback mechanism. How long do things take you? So, this is why you have what's called the planning fallacy with people who use to-do lists, which says that on average, studies have found that tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, "Okay, here's that thing on the to-do list. I'm going to work on that and see how long it takes me to get it done." So, you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email and then you get a notification and then you start talking to one of your colleagues and you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish, as opposed to when you say, "Look, I'm going to work on that task for as long as I said I would, but without distraction. That's it. That's all I'm going to do."

(00:33:39):
What you now have is a metric of how far you got. So, I worked on that presentation, it needs to be 30 slides long, and I worked on it for 30 minutes and I finished two slides. Okay, great. Well now, I know that I need 10 more of those time boxes to finish the entire task. And this is why it turns out that people who measure themselves the way I espouse of people who say, "I'm just going to measure myself based on, did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction regardless of whether I finished," the kicker here is they actually finish more. They get more done than the to-do list people because now, they understand how long things take them to finish and they can appropriately time that as opposed to what most of us did.

(00:34:20):
What I used to do before I wrote Indistractable was procrastinate, procrastinate, procrastinate. "Oh crap, I got to get this done. The deadline's here, so I'm going to work all night to finish it," and of course, that's not when you do your best work and it's very stressful.

Lenny (00:34:31):
Since you mentioned deadlines, do you have any advice lessons on that as a tool to get things done?

Nir Eyal (00:34:36):
What we find is that people who are very deadline motivated, they do finish what they say they're going to do, but of course, the quality is crap. They're typically getting by by the skin of their teeth, and I did this all the time. This is my entire college career and my MBA at Stanford career was waiting, waiting, waiting, and then finishing at the last moment. And I could do well enough, but of course, I could do so much better if I worked without distraction. And so, it wasn't until, and we all know this basically, right? We know that putting in a little bit of diligent effort, a little bit at a time with plenty of lead time is going to give us a much better result than cramming at the last minute. But the reason people don't do this is because they don't understand how important it is, one, to manage those internal triggers.

(00:35:22):
If you're constantly thinking, "Ugh, that project is going to suck. I don't really want to work on it. I don't want to make those sales calls. I don't want to make that presentation. I don't want to do that thing that feels uncomfortable," and you don't have the tools to deal with that discomfort, you're always going to procrastinate because fundamentally, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem. It's not a character flaw. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken. It's just that you don't have the tools to deal with emotional discomfort and that's the part that everybody skips over. So, we don't want to talk about these uncomfortable feelings, but that's where it has to start. And then, the part that people don't do is actually planning out not the task itself, but the time to work on the task without distraction. That's the part that if you can implement that step two that I talked about of making time for traction, that becomes a game changer.

Lenny (00:36:08):
So, I've tried things like this where it's here throughout the day, I'm going to try this, I'm going to do this and this, and I just don't end up doing it. Things come up or I just get distracted. I'm like, whatever. I guess one question is how often do you find yourself doing the things you set out in your calendar? And then two, any other advice for actually staying on track and doing things you set out to?

Nir Eyal (00:36:28):
Okay, so number one, did you have tools in place to deal with the discomfort? What did you do when you didn't feel it?

Lenny (00:36:32):
I did not. I did not have that surfing the wave and the ten-minute trick, and I'm curious if there's other tricks in that bucket actually, but no, I did not.

Nir Eyal (00:36:39):
Absolutely. Yeah. So, that's the most important thing and that is the most important section. That's why I put it at the front of the book because again, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, and I think this is fascinating. Personally, I really wanted to dive deep and not only understand why do we not do what we say we're going to do, but why do we do anything and everything? What is the seat of human motivation? And I think I didn't understand it properly. I think most people don't understand motivation properly. Doesn't that blow your mind? If you think about it, "I know what to do. I agree, this is what needs to get done. I just don't do it." Isn't that ridiculous? And by the way, this is not a new problem. Plato, 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher talked about this very same problem. 2500 years before the internet, before social media, before all these things that we think are so distracting online, the Greek philosopher has had the same exact problem.

(00:37:27):
This is part of the human condition. It is part of our DNA that we constantly get distracted. But to me, that's a fascinating mystery. Why is that? Well, if you look at the deeper question of why do we do anything and everything, the seat of human motivation most people think is about carrots and sticks. If you ask people, why do we do what we do? It's about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Jeremy Bentham said something similar to this. Sigmund Freud called it the pleasure principle. Neurologically speaking, it's not true. It's not true. It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It's not about carrots and sticks, but in fact, the carrot is the stick, okay? This is where I want to give you that matrix-like... Remember that scene, the Matrix, where there's that kid with a spoon and the spoon starts bending and the kid says, "Imagine there is no spoon," right?

Lenny (00:38:14):
Absolutely.

Nir Eyal (00:38:14):
Well, the carrot is the stick. What do I mean by that? We know that the only reason we do everything in anything from a neurological perspective is not about the pursuit of pleasure. It is all about the desire to escape discomfort. Everything you do, even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the carrot is the stick, because even wanting to feel good, craving, lusting, desire, hunger, that desire for something that feels good is itself psychologically destabilizing. The carrot is the stick. So, what that means, I think that's incredibly empowering because what that means is that whenever we don't do something, whenever we procrastinate, it's just a feeling. It's all it is. It's just a feeling. And so, when we learn those tools, it doesn't mean where I think people start intellectualizing it and thinking, "There must be something broken with me. Maybe you need a pill, maybe you need a treatment."

(00:39:07):
Chances are there's a ninety-nine percent chance, there's nothing wrong with you. It's simply that you don't have these tools. So, that's where we have to start, is absolutely understanding and applying these techniques so that when you feel that discomfort, you use that discomfort. What I found in my research writing this book is that high performers in every industry, business, the arts, sports, high performers, they feel the same internal triggers. They also feel lonely. They also feel bored. They also feel stressed. They also feel anxious, but they use that discomfort like a rocket fuel to propel them towards traction. Whereas what distractable people do, as soon as they feel uncomfortable, as soon as they feel bored, as soon as they feel lonesome, as soon as soon as they feel indecisive or stressed, boom, they're escaping it with a drink, with a click, with something to take their mind off of that discomfort. So, that has to be step number one.

Lenny (00:39:55):
That is fascinating. Basically, distraction is an emotional regulation problem. It's the way you put it. What else works in helping you manage that discomfort? We've talked about this ten-minute trick, the timer, the surfing of the urge. What else is in that bucket of things I could try when I'm just like, "Nah, I'm just going to go check Twitter. I need to work on this thing, right now."

Nir Eyal (00:40:13):
Yeah, so there's a bunch of different techniques you can use there in terms of the internal triggers. We can get into some of the more nitty-gritty techniques. There's lots and lots of them. The most important thing here though is that once you have some in your toolkit that you want to try, let's say it's a ten-minute rule, it's surfing the urge, there's re-imagining the task, the temperament, all kinds of things that you can do. The next thing is to put it on your calendar, which we talked about briefly. So, let's say you say, "Okay, I've got that time when I..." What did you say that you want to do, that you check email instead?

Lenny (00:40:40):
Start on my newsletter post for the next week, or just continue.

Nir Eyal (00:40:43):
To write it?

Lenny (00:40:44):
Yeah, write it.

Nir Eyal (00:40:46):
Okay. And did you have that in your calendar? That was part of the time punch-me-in-the-face-if-I-don't-do-it kind of thing?

Lenny (00:40:50):
That was back when I had a regular job. These days, it's just, what I used to do is my first half of the day until 3:00 is just deep work time. I called it it's-time-to-build time, and then 3:00 beyond is meetings. So, it was actually a huge block of time of focus time, but it was not subdivided by the things I wanted to do throughout the day.

Nir Eyal (00:41:10):
I see. Okay. So, step two would be putting on your calendar, "I'm going to work on writing this newsletter for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, whatever amount of time." Make it whatever is reasonable for you based on how long you think you can do it. Put that on your schedule. Okay? Step number three is hack back the external triggers. So, did you find that when you said I was going to work on writing this newsletter, was there anything in your external environment that was pinging, dinging, kids, pets, spouse, anything like that?

Lenny (00:41:38):
It's interesting that now that you say that, just that fact that only 10% of distractions are from that. So, it makes me, on the one hand, I recognize that most of the time, there's not a thing pulling me to Twitter, LinkedIn, or whatever. Most of the time, it's just like, that's probably something interesting going on. But there's definitely times when I see a little badge or my little phone gets a little push or yeah, my wife's with a kid in the distance. I'm like, "Oh, let's go check out what's happening there."

Nir Eyal (00:42:02):
Yeah. So, that's where we want to hack back. So, the reason I use the term hack. To hack something is to gain unauthorized access. Someone hacks into your bank account or hacks into your database. We know that these technologies are gaining unauthorized access to our attention span when they're constantly pinging and dinging us. So, there's some very simple things you can do. Setting a schedule in advance so that your device turns off as it goes to do-not-disturb during certain times of the day or before you begin this task, before you start writing, you make sure to turn on do-not-disturb, so that there's nothing in your way. On my desktop, I have a do-not-disturb set from midnight to 11:59 all the time. It's constantly on do-not-disturb because I don't want these constant notifications disturbing me when I'm doing focus work.

(00:42:52):
So, making sure that that's on. When it comes to, many of us work from home today, so making sure that your family knows when the time is that you are indistractable. And I'll give you one tip. I know you have a baby at home, but soon, that baby is going to be a toddler. And so, one thing that we did in my household is that my wife went to Amazon and she got what we call the concentration crown. And the concentration crown is just this little wreath thing that she wears. It looks like a little princess thing. It has little LED lights. It lights up. There's a picture of it in the book. And when my daughter was only six years old, we told her, "Look, whenever mommy is wearing the concentration crown, that means that she can't be interrupted and she will be with you within 30 minutes."

(00:43:37):
So, her time block was always no more than 30 minutes. So, we said, "We will be with you within 30 minutes. Please don't interrupt unless you're bleeding. Okay? If you're bleeding, you can interrupt us, but unless you're bleeding," this is when my daughter was only six years old. She could find something to do. It's okay for kids to be bored time to time, but as long as mommy was wearing the concentration crown that told her, and by the way, me, as her significant other, as her husband, worked really, really well because I would always interrupt her and say, "Hey Julie, can I ask you this one thing?" And she was working on her computer, but I didn't know whether she was listening to a podcast or a video or doing work that needed concentration. So, hacking back those external triggers, making sure that they don't gain unauthorized access by interrupting the interruption, whether it's with your kids, your colleagues.

(00:44:24):
So, every copy of indistractable has this little pull-out piece of paper, this piece of card stock that you fold into thirds and you put on your computer monitor. Okay, it's this big red sign on your computer monitor that says, "I'm indistractable at the moment. Please come back later." Now you can say, "Well, why don't I just put on headphones and my colleagues will know I'm not to be interrupted?" Yeah, but then they think you're putzing around, playing video games or something on your machine, as opposed to if you say, "No, I'm doing focused work right now, please come back later," you're making it acceptable to not constantly be interrupted. You're making it okay culturally appropriate to work without distractions. So, those are just some ways that you can hack back those external triggers.

Lenny (00:45:03):
I love that crown idea. I think a lot of people are going to use that. This time of year is prime for career reflection and setting goals for professional growth. I always like to spend this time reflecting on what I accomplished the previous year, what I hope to accomplish the next year, and whether this is the year, I look for a new opportunity.

(00:45:58):
For avoiding distractions, triggers, pushes, all that stuff, is there any tools you recommend? I imagine, this is a lot of people are thinking. Is there like a way to block Twitter?

Nir Eyal (00:46:07):
Yeah, absolutely. So, that's a perfect lead-in to step number four. So, we talked about step one, master internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers. We just talked about step number three. Step number four is preventing distraction with pacts. So with pacts, there's three kinds of pacts. We have a price pact, where there's some kind of financial disincentive to go off track. So, this is where we talked about earlier. You're making some kind of bet. We could talk about how I got into shape for the first time in my life using something like this. How I finished the book using something like this. That's a price pact. There's an identity pact, which is very, very impactful, which is what you're doing is you're forming a personal identity. So, this comes out of the psychology of religion where we know that people who call themselves a certain moniker. For example, if you say you're a devout Muslim, you're not debating whether you should have a gin and tonic because devout Muslims don't drink.

(00:46:58):
If you say I'm a vegan or vegetarian, a vegetarian doesn't wake up in the morning and say, "Hmm, I wonder if I should have a bacon sandwich for breakfast." No, they are vegetarian. That is who they are. So, that's why the book is called Indistractable. Indistractable Is meant to sound like indestructible. It is your identity, it is who you are. And so, is it any different for someone to say, "You know what? I'm sorry I don't check every ping and ding every 30 seconds. I'm Indistractable. Or, "You know what? If we're going to have a meal together, if we're going to sit down and have lunch together, I want to have that lunch free of distractions. So, can we put away our phones?" Is that any different from someone who says, "I have particular dietary preferences," or, "I have a particular religious garb?"

(00:47:35):
No, maybe it's not the norm. Maybe it's a minority of people who do that. But that's what I think it's going to take for the world to become indistractable, is that more of us show how great of a life we can have when we have some of these principles and make it part of our identity. And then the third pact is what's called an effort pact. And this gets into your question around what kind of tools we can use. An effort pact is where there's some kind of friction, some kind of effort that you need to take in order to get distracted. So, as the last line of defense, that's why this is the fourth step, the last line of defense, the firewall against distraction is making sure that you keep yourself in just as much as we keep distractions out. So, I'll give you a personal story here. I don't don't know if this is a family show. Is it okay if I talk about my sex life a little bit?

Lenny (00:48:22):
Absolutely. Let's talk and get into it.

Nir Eyal (00:48:25):
It's not as exciting as it might sound. I've been married for twenty-two years now. My wife and I found that we weren't being as intimate as we used to be. And this was when I first started writing the book. And part of the problem was that every night, we would go to bed and she would be fondling her iPhone and I would be caressing my iPad. And we weren't being intimate because we were busy playing with our devices as opposed to each other. And so, I started doing this research around Indistractable and I learned about this technique around making an effort pact. And so, what we did, I went to the hardware store and I bought us this $10 outlet timer and this outlet timer, anything you plug into it will turn on or off at a particular time of day or night, whatever you set.

(00:49:15):
And so, in my household, until this very day, every night at 10:00 P.M., my internet router shuts off. So, what does that do? We know that every night, 10:00 P.M., the internet router's going to shut off. So, my daughter knows, my wife knows, I know. I got to get everything done that I need to do online because the internet's going to shut off. Now, could I turn the internet back on? Of course, I could. I could tether, I could go pull out the router and replug it in, but that takes effort. And so, what I've done is if all else fails, if the internal triggers, making time for traction, hacking back, if all else fails, I've inserted a bit of mindfulness in something that I used to be mindless about. Now, I have to ask myself, "Wait a minute. Do I really need to go all that trouble of replugging and unplugging my router or should I do what I said I was going to do, which is get to bed on time and maybe be intimate with my wife?"

(00:50:05):
It's made a world of difference and I'll tell you honestly, Lenny. Now after a few years of doing this, it's become part of our routine. We all know bedtime's at 10:00 P.M. That's when we need to start getting ready for bed. The internet router's going to shut off. We actually don't even need this anymore because it's become part of our routine. So, that's one very cheap tool anyone can use as part of this effort pact. Another thing that I use almost every day, my daughter uses it as well, is this wonderful app called Forest. Do you know Forest?

Lenny (00:50:32):
No.

Nir Eyal (00:50:33):
It's awesome. So, here's the way Forest works. So, it's this cute little app here. I can show it to you. I'll pull it up. And the way Forest works is when you say you're going to do focused work time, you plug in how much work time you want. So, let's say I'm going to do 40 minutes of focused work time. There's that cute little virtual tree that's planted on my screen as soon as I hit go and if I pick up my phone and I do anything with it, that cute little virtual tree gets cut down. It's just a small reminder to say, "Yep, that's not what you said you were going to do right now. You said you were going to work with that distraction. Here, you are picking up your phone." It reminds you, this is not what you said you were going to do. So, it inserts that bit of friction, that bit of effort. Another, you asked for more tools. Another product I love is called Focusmate. Have you tried Focusmate?

Lenny (00:51:22):
Is that the one where they match you with somebody and you're kind of working, watching each other work?

Nir Eyal (00:51:25):
Yes, exactly. It's like a chat roulette without the dirty bits. So, I love this company so much, I actually invested in it. So basically, what you do is you go online, you look at this calendar and you pick a time when you want to do focused work. So, one of my issues used to be getting started. Once I got started, I was good, but getting started 8:00 A.M., I kind of like what you were saying with this cold start problem. So, what it does is it gives you this pact, again, this pre-commitment you're making with another person, "Okay, 8:00 A.M., I'm going to be there. And if you don't show up, you're going to get a bad review." So, it binds you to another person to build this effort pact to say, "I will be here at that time." You say, "Okay, what are you working on? What am I working on? All right, go." And for that entire time box, you work without distraction. And just seeing that other person who's also working without distraction is a wonderful way to bind you into what you said you were going to do.

(00:52:17):
So, those are just a few tools. There's many, many others.

Lenny (00:52:20):
Amazing. Okay, so let me actually try to just list out all the things you've shared so far and it's going to be across all the four steps and then I'm going to follow up on a couple things here. So, here's my notes. One is this idea of just set a ten-minute timer and just tell yourself, "I am going to work on something that I really want to work on right now for 10 minutes and that's all I'm going to do." And while you're doing that, surf the urge, you're going to feel like you don't, but just surf it and feel it and be aware that this is difficult. The calendaring of your day, that feels like a fundamental part of your approach is just figure out what you want to do during the day. Ahead of time, put it on the calendar. So, your to-do list is your calendar, essentially.

(00:53:02):
There's this whole idea of pacts. You shared a bunch of different pact ideas, there's like I'll pay you a lot of money if I don't do this. There's this Wi-Fi. Okay. And then I guess that translates into some of these other things. The Wi-Fi killer device, the Forest app, the Focusmate app and product. And then there's a few other things you shared. Just do not disturb, like set a timer so that during the day, you have do-not-disturb on during set times. For you, it's all the time, which I try to do, too. And then obviously, let your wife through important contacts and then make your family aware of when you're going to be working so that they know not to bother you. Maybe this concentration crown.

Nir Eyal (00:53:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:42):
Okay. Before we move on to a different topic, I'd love to spend a little more time in that first bucket because it feels like your point is so important that most of our distraction is this emotional regulation and we just don't like discomfort. And so, I'm curious what else you could teach me and teach people about getting better at managing that emotion. Are there any other tactics in that bucket that might be useful?

Nir Eyal (00:54:02):
Absolutely. So, there's three big buckets in terms of mastering these internal triggers. We can reimagine the task, reimagine the trigger, and reimagine our temperament. And so, maybe I can give you one big tip I think that I discovered when it came to reimagining our temperament. If we think about our temperament as these immutable qualities, as the attributes of our personality, we have to be very careful about what kind of identity and what kind of limitations we let in to our psyche. And I'll give you a good example of this. So, a few years ago, there was this line of research around what's called ego depletion. Ego depletion is this idea that willpower is a depletable resource. And you saw some researchers doing studies that seem to suggest that willpower was something that you run out of, that for me, I would come home after a long day of work and I'd say, "Oh, I'm out of willpower. I'm 'spent', there's nothing else I can do. Give me that pint of Ben and Jerry's. I'm going to sit in front of the TV because I'm spent. There's no more willpower left."

(00:55:03):
And some of these studies seem to suggest there was this phenomenon except the problem became that in the social sciences when something sounds a little fishy, when it sounds too good to be true, the scientific process dictates that we should rerun those studies. And it turns out that these studies around ego depletion could not replicate. We couldn't find the effect. And so, there was one exception to this and that exception was in a study done by Carol Dweck, she's one of my research heroes. She wrote the book Mindset, you're probably familiar with, and she did a fascinating study where she found that ego depletion does actually exist, but only for one group of people.

(00:55:42):
Who was that group of people? It turns out that the only people who really did run out of willpower the way you would run out of charge in a battery were people who believed that willpower was a limited resource. And so, this is super, super important to not let ourselves be influenced by these ridiculous notions, these beliefs that somehow we are impaired, that we are limited, that we're addicted. That's a really popular one, that we're all addicted, we're all unable to control these behaviors. That is not true. And in fact, it's only true if you believe it is true. So, it should be part of our practice to tell ourselves we are indistractable. Indistractable is meant to sound like indestructible. It's meant to sound like a superpower. So, repeating to yourself that you're not limited, it's just about your actions. It's not a moral failing. It's not something wrong with you. It's not that technologies are doing it to you. It's simply a series of behaviors that we have to practice.

Lenny (00:56:37):
I really like that. That's a theme that comes up a lot on this podcast is people that feel like they're responsible for their situation, they didn't cause it, but they're still responsible. It is their responsibility to deal with it, end up being more successful. And there's this idea of just being high agency.

Nir Eyal (00:56:52):
So, one of the things that I think is important to remember here is that there's a lot of things that the individual can do. I think there's a lot of things that we can do within a company or an organization, as well, that we can make our workplace indestructible. But then I think there's some things that we can do on a societal level, and these are called social antibodies. That social antibodies are when society spreads norms or manners that help us overcome otherwise antisocial or destructive behaviors. And so, the good news is that we have been here before with something far more harmful and far more addictive than social media or technology distractions. If you think back to the 1980s, I was a child of the '80s. I remember the '80s very well, and I remember when I was growing up, we had ashtrays in our living room.

(00:57:41):
In fact, everyone I knew had ashtrays in their living room. And today, that sounds crazy. You couldn't imagine walking into someone's home and lighting up a cigarette. If someone did that to you, that would be crazy. No one would do that today. Well, why? Why did that happen? Why would it be so incredibly rude to just walk into someone's home and light up a cigarette? Well, because there wasn't a law that said that that was illegal, someone's private residence. What changed was that we have new norms, new manners around how to behave when it comes to these destructive behaviors. So, I remember when my mom took away those ashtrays in our living room and she threw them away, and one day, one of her friends came over and took out a pact of cigarettes and was about to light a cigarette. My mom said, "No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. We are nonsmokers."

(00:58:26):
You see, she had this now and that she used to describe herself. She described herself as a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, if you'd kindly go outside. And of course, that's the norm today. But it took great people like my mom to go against the trend for these antisocial behaviors. So, I think the same thing is going to happen when it comes to becoming indistractable. Frankly, with or without my book, my book was intended to accelerate this process, but we're going to do this naturally because what humans do throughout history when it comes to figuring out how to use a technology well is that we adapt and we adopt. We adapt to the technology by forming new behaviors, new norms. So, just like my mom said, "Hey, we are nonsmokers. That's my identity. I'm a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, you're going to have to go outside."

(00:59:09):
We need to be comfortable with saying, "Hey, we are indistractable." If someone sits down with you across the table and you're having a nice conversation, they take out their funny, say, "Hey, hey, if we're going to have a conversation, let's be here both in body and mind." That means putting these devices outside of meetings. If we're going to have a business meeting or a personal meeting, we're going to declare these no-phone zones because that's who we are. We want to be indistractable. So, we adopt these new behaviors and we see that happening already. And then we adapt to these behaviors, I should say, with these new norms. And then we adopt new technologies that help us fight the bad aspects of the last generation of technology, and that's what we have always done.

(00:59:48):
In fact, right now, there's an explosion of tech companies that are making a lot of money. A lot of these apps and startups are making money with tools to help fix the last generation of technology. And so, there's all kinds of tools listed in my book from Forest and Focusmate, all kinds of tools that can help us put technology in its place, ironically enough, with new and better technology.

Lenny (01:00:09):
You've touched on this point that I want to come back to around how you're not as confident that we're as addicted to technology and apps as we think, and I think that's really important. I'm excited to chat about it. Before we get there, I wanted to chat and follow this thread essentially of becoming Indistractable at work and building a company essentially that helps your teammates become less distractable. What advice would you give to leaders at companies to help employees at the company have better focus, essentially?

Nir Eyal (01:00:37):
A lot of folks that I've worked with in the past have said, "Look, I can become indistractable. I follow these four steps, fantastic. I'm indistractable. But what if my company's not indistractable? How do I help other people become indistractable? Or what if my boss is not indistractable and they're constantly asking me and pinging and dinging me for stuff and I'm not able to do my best work? So, what do I do about that?" So, there's a whole section in the book on how to build an indistractable workplace. And what I discovered was in the research in writing this book is that indistractable companies have three traits. And so, the first trait is that Indistractable companies provide employees with what's called psychological safety. This comes out of the research from Amy Edmondson at the Harvard Business School. And what she discovered was truly that companies have to provide employees with psychological safety.

(01:01:23):
Meaning, if you can't talk about a problem, if you can't raise your hand and say, "Hey, you know what? I'm just not able to do my best work when I'm constantly expected to reply to every email, to every notification, every 30 seconds. I can't do my best work." If you can't talk about this problem, that is the problem. As I like to say, distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. Distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. And when it comes to the workplace, if you don't give employees that psychological safety to say, "Hey, how do we deal with this problem just like any other problem?" That in fact is a problem. It's not the technology, it's the fact that you can't get together and talk about this problem without fear of somebody thinking, "Oh, you're lazy," or, "You don't want to be on call," or, "You're expecting other people to work for you."

(01:02:04):
No, that's not the issue at all. It's simply that we need to formulate how to fix this problem just like any other business challenge. The second trait is employees need a forum to talk about this problem. So, in researching this book, I ask people, what's the most distracting technology? What technology in the workplace do you find to be most distracting? The number two was some kind of group messaging service, and Slack was mentioned the most number of times. By the way, number one was email. Number two was some kind of group messaging platform, and Slack was mentioned the most often. And so, I went to visit Slack headquarters. I went to go see my friend Amir, who used to work there at the time, and I knocked on the door and I expected to see a company that was incredibly distracted because if it was the technology that was the source of the problem, nobody uses Slack more than Slack.

(01:02:52):
They should be the most distracted company on earth. But that's not what I found at all because Slack, in fact, embodied these three attributes. They gave people psychological safety. They gave people a forum to talk about these problems. How did they do that? They actually created Slack channels at Slack. They had one Slack channel called Beef Tweets, and Beef Tweets was a channel where people could talk about their beef with a company. And it wasn't that necessarily management had to fix every problem. That's not the point. It's that they had to acknowledge that employee's voices were being heard. And how did they do that? Surprisingly enough, they did it with emoji. So, when a problem that an employee mentioned was fixed, they sent the green check mark emoji, but if it was a problem that maybe couldn't be fixed, but what they wanted to acknowledge that management had seen it, they would send the eyes emoji.

(01:03:38):
And so, the important thing here is to give employees some kind of forum. It could be a Slack channel, it could be another case study in the book is the Boston Consulting Group, which I used to work at. They've gone from one of the most distractable companies to today. They're ranked as one of the best places to work in America. They have these meetings where they talk about PTO, predictable time off. And so, they completely changed that organizational culture by following these steps, as well. The last, the third attribute, which is the most important of the three, is that management must exemplify what it means to be indistractable because culture is like water. It flows downhill. And so, people will look to management to see how they behave, and they will act in accordance with those expectations. So, at Slack Company headquarters, in the company canteen, it says in bright pink letters, it says, "Work hard and go home."

(01:04:31):
Work hard and go home. That is not something you would expect to see at a hard charging Silicon Valley startup, but that's what you see there because everybody in the company, this was before the acquisition. I don't know what it's like now, but when I wrote the book, this was certainly the case that everybody from Stewart Butterfield on down, the CEO on down, believed that to do people's best work, they had to work without distraction. So, if you use Slack on nights and weekends, you were told, "That's not what we do here." You were reprimanded because that was not part of the company culture. So, it's really those three traits, psychological safety, a form to talk about these problems, and management has to exemplify what it means to be indistractable.

Lenny (01:05:04):
I want to move to a different topic, but before we do, is there one thing or maybe two things that a listener can do, say today or tomorrow or this week, that would make it significant dent on their ability to focus and avoid distraction?

Nir Eyal (01:05:18):
I would say understanding these four steps of master the internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers, and preventing distraction with pacts. If you can do one small thing in each of those four strategies, one small thing, that's a wonderful, wonderful first step. You don't have to do everything in the book. I'm giving you many of different options, but one small thing in each of those categories is huge. Now, when it comes to the workplace, one of the benefits of making a time box calendar is that you have a physical artifact. You have something that you can print out and show to other people. And so, I hear this a lot when it comes to people who say, "Okay, I'm indistractable but my boss isn't, what do I do? I'm constantly ping and ding from my boss. How do I get control over my time?"

(01:06:02):
Here's what you do. This is called schedule syncing or managing your manager. Here's what happens. You print out your calendar or you show it to them on your screen, and you say, "Hey boss, I need 10 minutes with you, Monday morning. Is that okay? Can I get 10 minutes with you?" And now, what you're going to do is you're going to show them your time box calendar for your working hours. You're going to say, "Okay, boss, you see here's my time for email. Here's my time for that meeting you asked me to go to. Here's time for that big project I'm working on. Now, you see this other piece of paper? Okay, you see this other list here? This is a list of things you've asked me to do that I'm having trouble fitting into my calendar." So, what I'm helping you do here is avoiding the worst piece of personal productivity advice.

(01:06:40):
The worst piece of personal productivity advice is if you want to be better at time management, you need to learn how to say no. What kind of stupid advice is that? Only a tenured professor who can't get fired would give you that kind of stupid advice. If you tell your boss no, you're going to get fired, that's dumb. You don't tell your boss no, you ask your boss to help you prioritize. That is your boss' most important job is to prioritize. So, you're not saying no. You're saying, "Here's my calendar. Here's this list of stuff you've asked me to do. Help me prioritize." And here's what's going to happen. Your boss is going to look at your calendar and say, "You know what? That meeting, you really don't need to be at that meeting. But that thing on that piece of paper that you listed over here, that's way more important. Can you swap that out?"

(01:07:23):
And let me tell you, I've started three companies. I've sold two so far, and bosses, your manager will worship the ground you walk on because we're all wondering, "What is it that you're doing?" And I know we have to trust our employees, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. But we're still wondering, "Hey, that thing that you said was going to be done isn't done. Why not? How are you spending your time?" So, if you can proactively sit down with your boss so that they understand how you are spending your time, and again, this takes maybe 10 minutes, you do this schedule sync process that not only works really well in the workplace, it also works really well at home. So, my wife and I used to have conflicts over who's going to pick up our daughter, and why didn't you take out the trash? And we would have these conflicts because we didn't synchronize our schedules.

(01:08:07):
Well, now, we take maybe five minutes a week. Sunday evening, we sit down together. Let me look at your schedule. Let me look at my schedule. "Okay, now we're synchronized. It's amazing." We prevent so many conflicts just by doing this simple schedule sync process.

Lenny (01:08:20):
I love that advice. I recommend a very similar approach to people to align with their managers. Basically, I call it managing up. And the way I describe it, manager taught me this is, I call it prioritizing and communicating. You could prioritize and not communicate, and your manager would be like, "What the hell? Why didn't you do this thing?" It's, "I prioritized. I never told you. Here's where I put it on my list." Or you could just communicate like, "No," and that doesn't work as you said. The best combination is just like, "Here's what I'm doing, here's why I will prioritize this and let me know what you think. Would you agree? You want to move it up? You want to move it down?"

Nir Eyal (01:08:51):
Exactly. And how much input. We always talk about one of the reasons I hate to-do lists is because to-do lists are just a register of output. It's the stuff you want to have done, but you can't have output without input. If you go to a baker, let's say it's your kid's birthday party and say, "Hey, I want two dozen cupcakes." Well, the baker's going to say, "Okay, I need flour, I need sugar, I need butter. I need all these inputs in order to make the output." But somehow when it comes to knowledge work, we just add more and more outputs without considering the input. What is the input for knowledge work? It's only two things. It's your time and your attention. That's it. Your time and your attention. So, in order to get the output, we have to think about the input, which is why the schedule syncing and time boxing is so important. Again, that's something that a to-do list can never give you.

Lenny (01:09:36):
Awesome. Okay. For our last topic, I wanted to spend some time on Hooked, which I think could be its own podcast. That could be a whole other episode of your first book that did really well. And essentially, this book, Hooked, is about teaching people how to get people hooked on their product. I know that you have this very contrarian perspective on, are we actually addicted to technology? Is it hurting mental health? All these things. So, this is contrarian corner. I'd love to hear your perspective on just, why is it that we're not as hooked on social media and technology as people think?

Nir Eyal (01:10:08):
Yeah. Okay, so there's a lot there. So, let me explain what Hooked was for compared to Indistractable. So, Hooked is about how do we build habit-forming products for good. And so, the idea there was that I think we need to use more of these techniques when it comes to healthy behaviors. We want people to get hooked to a language learning app. Duolingo, one of my former clients. That's a great thing that they found ways to get people hooked to learning a new language compared to the way we used to learn languages. Getting people hooked to exercise. One of the case studies in Hooked is Fitbot, which is an app that helps people form these habits around exercise. Getting hooked to a personal finance app to help you save money, getting hooked to enterprise software. That's all great, right? If it helps you become more productive, helps you live a happier, healthier life, that's wonderful.

(01:10:53):
So, nobody's worried about people getting addicted to enterprise SaaS. That's not an issue. So, the vast majority of products out there, they're not worried about addicting anyone. The real problem the vast majority of businesses out there have is that nobody cares. They have a wonderful product that could really improve people's lives, but people aren't using it. And so, it's really about how do you get people to keep coming back to your product or service, not because they have to, but because they want to. And so, what essentially I do at Hooked is steal the secrets of these Silicon Valley giants. I literally ripped out their psychology to understand what makes their products work so well, so that everybody in every conceivable industry that is devoted to improving people's lives can use those habits for good. So, that's what Hooked is for. So, if Hooked is about good habits, Indistractable is about how do we break bad habits, but for different products, we want to build a good habit with the exercise app, with these SaaS app, with the good habits, and we also want to break the bad habits.

(01:11:49):
So, that's the two sides of the same coin. They're not negations, they're complements. And I think I am uniquely qualified to write both these books because I know these techniques work and I know where they don't work. And I can tell you, having written Hooked, these techniques are very good. They're very effective. They're not that good. This isn't mind control. We're not hijacking people's brains. And there's a lot of people out there, a lot of tech critics have made a lot of money and gotten a lot of speaking gigs over scaring the crap out of people because people love that stuff. I was a journalism co-major in college, and the first rule of journalism is if it bleeds, it leads. So, you can get a lot more attention and a lot more press, a lot more invites to Ted Talks if you tell people, "Technology is melting your brain, it's super evil. Let's shut it all down."

(01:12:40):
This is the classic chicken little story. People love that stuff. The truth is much more nuanced, but nobody likes nuance. Nobody likes the answer to every complex question, which is always the same. "It depends. It depends." For some people, overusing technology is a real problem. So, for people who are pathologically addicted, that can be very harmful because, what is the definition of addiction? An addiction is a compulsive dependency on a behavior or substance that harms the user. Now, that's about 3% to 5% of the population is pathologically addicted, but we toss out this word addiction all the time. Everything's addictive. My wife ordered a shoes from DSW, and on the box it says, "Danger, addictive contents inside." It's shoes, people. Shoes. And so, what we have done by pathologizing, by medicalizing this behavior is that now, everything's an addiction. "Oh, you like playing Candy Crush? It's addictive. You like social media. It's addictive."

(01:13:37):
No, it's not addictive to everyone. No more than saying, "Hey, a lot of people have a glass of wine with dinner, but not everyone's an alcoholic. So, why do we think everyone who uses social media is addicted?" They're not. But we love that terminology. We love it. Why? Because even the word addiction comes from the Latin addictio, which means slave. So, it's much easier to tell ourselves, "I'm enslaved. My brain is being hijacked. My focus is being stolen. It's all Silicon Valley's fault." As opposed to saying, "Wait a minute, this isn't really a distraction." I'm sorry. "It's not really an addiction, it's a distraction," because then now I have personal responsibility. Now, I have to do something about it. That's no fun. Can I just blame somebody? But for the vast majority of people, save the people who are actually pathologically addicted, which by the way, I do think we need special protections for. If you're not a child who I do think we need special protections for, and you're not pathologically addicted, this is a personal responsibility issue that thankfully, all of us can overcome if we have the right tools.

Lenny (01:14:33):
Wow, this is quite the contrarian juicy corner. I wish we had more time to dig into all this stuff. So, basically, I checked Twitter a lot. I checked my phone a lot. You're saying that essentially, don't call it addiction. I'm just finding more things to get distracted by to push away from all these uncomfortable emotions that I'm feeling doing hard work.

Nir Eyal (01:14:52):
That's exactly right. And again, it doesn't mean it's your fault, but it is your responsibility as we talked about earlier, because who else's responsibility is it? We love these simple narratives. We love these simple stories of something bad is happening, so this is the bad guy. Well, sometimes the bad guy is also us, or at least we have a role to play in taking responsibility for this stuff. And so, if it was something that is insurmountable, if something you can't do anything about, for example, children, I think children are a protected class. My fifteen-year-old can't walk into a bar and order a gin and tonic. She can't walk into a casino and start playing blackjack. She's not ready for that. So, I do think we need regulations to protect children. I think we also need protections around people who are actually pathologically addicted.

(01:15:35):
If you know people are getting addicted to your product, you do have an ethical responsibility. And I've written about this for the past 10 years now about specific legislation that I think we need around what's called a use and abuse policy for people who are pathologically addicted. But for 95% of us, it's not an addiction. It's something we can absolutely take control over if we want to and if we have the right tools.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Very interesting food for thoughts. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with?

Nir Eyal (01:16:06):
There's a wonderful quote that I really love from Paulo Coelho who said that, "A mistake repeated more than once is a decision." A mistake repeated more than once is a decision, such a great quote. And I think it's time that we realize that if we are not doing something about this problem, we are deciding to be distractable. The difference between an indistractable person and a distractable person is that an indistractable person says, "Ah, okay, I see what you did to me there. I see I got distracted. I'm not going to let it happen again." How many times can we get distracted by social media, by whatever, before we say, "Okay, I'm going to take steps today to prevent getting distracted tomorrow"? That's what defines an indistractable person. So, if you really want to summarize my work in Indistractable into one Mantra, it's that the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. The antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. Fundamentally, distraction is an impulse control issue. That's all it is, and it's a skill like any other.

(01:17:04):
We learn skills. Why do we expect that we should just be born with this innate skill to fight distraction? It's a skill like any other. And so, the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. If we plan ahead, if we know that we're going to take steps a day to prevent getting distracted tomorrow, there's no distraction we can't overcome.

Lenny (01:17:22):
I love it. I love the message of empowerment and agency. I feel like that's so applicable to product management and a lot of the people that listen to this podcast. And just another example of that even though the world is making life more difficult for us, potentially, you could still do something about it. And I really like just the general message that you can do something about it. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nir Eyal (01:17:44):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:17:45):
All right. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Nir Eyal (01:17:48):
There's this book called Alchemy by Rory Sutherland that I love. It's a fantastic book. It delves into the psychology of various experiences. So, highly recommend that. And I'm reading a book right now, actually. It's all myself right here called The Experience Machine by Andy Clark, which I'm really enjoying.

Lenny (01:18:04):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Nir Eyal (01:18:08):
Okay, so it's not very recent, but it's one of my all time favorite movies that nobody's seen, which is Empire of the Sun. Have you ever seen Empire of the Sun?

Lenny (01:18:16):
Nope.

Nir Eyal (01:18:17):
Okay, you got to see it. So, one of my favorite movies, it has Christian Bale in it when he was only, I think, 12 or 13 years old. Steven Spielberg was the director, John Malkovich stars in it. Unbelievable movie that for some reason nobody saw. So, if you're a Christian Bale fan, which I am, I think he's a fantastic actor, Empire of the Sun, classic, awesome movie.

Lenny (01:18:38):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're hiring them for a job?

Nir Eyal (01:18:43):
I'm not a big fan of interviews in general. I'm a huge fan of small projects. So, what I'll oftentimes do is pay people to do a small project and then I can see their work output. I find that that works much, much better than any question I can come up with.

Lenny (01:18:59):
Awesome. A few other people have mentioned that exact idea, especially at a company. I think about Linea, where they pay people to do a little project within their company. They're kind of like contractors for the company for a little bit.

Nir Eyal (01:19:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or something physical?

Nir Eyal (01:19:15):
I went to Japan a few months ago and I just became obsessed with all things Japanese, and so I bought a hundred different little gadgets that helped me make Japanese food at home. So, I had this little sesame grinder thing. The Japanese are so good at making devices for everything, so I would just put this under the general bucket of everything Japanese.

Lenny (01:19:36):
I use Muji pens, which is an amazing Japanese brand. They're just like...

Nir Eyal (01:19:43):
Yes, we have Muji. Yes, exactly. I have some of those, as well. They're great.

Lenny (01:19:44):
Go Japan. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either at work or life, that you find really useful?

Nir Eyal (01:19:52):
So, I do have several mantras that I repeat to myself daily. One of those is my life purpose. My purpose in life is to explain the world so that it can be made better. Now, that might not apply to everyone. That's my personal life motto. It kind of just helps me recenter and refocus my purpose for living, which is to serve others, to make the world a better place. And the way I do that is to explain the world so that it can be made better. So, of course, that's not going to apply to everyone, but I do think there is something very useful about sitting down and saying, "Wait, what is the purpose of my life?" And so, for me, having that mantra, which I literally repeat every single day as like a little prayer, I'm very secular. I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I think there's a lot of wisdom to be adopted from the practices of organized religion, and one of those is this secular prayer reminding me of my purpose.

Lenny (01:20:36):
I love that. Final question. You wrote a book about building habits. What's your best and worst habit these days?

Nir Eyal (01:20:45):
This is tricky. So, I think the reason I'm struggling answering this is because there's a difference between habits and routines and a lot of things that people think are habits are not really habits. So, I was going to say exercise. I used to be clinically obese and now I exercise. But that's not technically a habit because it's not done with little or no conscious thought. It's a routine, but I think that's probably one of my best routines is that I've finally, for the first time in my life, really gotten into physical fitness. I have maybe not quite a six-pack, but maybe like a four-pack at forty-five years old. I'm pretty proud of that and I'm not saying that to brag. I'm saying it as a testimony to the fact that when you say you're going to do something and actually do it, how wonderful that feels.

(01:21:29):
Just live your life with intent. I'm not athletic. I never was athletic. I still don't really like exercise, but I do it and I eat right because I say I will. So, I think that's probably my best routine and probably my worst habit is that I still feel these impulses. If the definition of a habit is an impulse to do or behavior with little or no conscious thought, you better well damn believe that I feel the impulse to check Instagram for a quick minute or to look at this. I still feel that. I think the difference is that now, I know I'm going to feel those. I know that's part of my daily experience, and I have those practices in place so that they don't get the best of me.

Lenny (01:22:04):
Just along those lines, something I was going to ask but I forgot is, how often do you not do the things you had in your calendar? What percentage of the things don't get done the way you planned?

Nir Eyal (01:22:12):
So, when things change dramatically, then I tend to fall off track. So, the first time, if I make a big change in my calendar, I'm much more likely to fall off track. The more I can go from week to week with small parts of my calendar changing, the more I'll get to a hundred percent doing what I say I'm going to do. But I would say on average, once I have, I pretty much have my more or less calendar set for the week. I would say maybe 10% of the tasks I'll go a little too late on or I'll start, but then of course the idea is to make sure that doesn't happen again next time.

(01:22:41):
But there is, of course, some wiggle room. So, when that might happen, let's say it's 10% of the time I go off track, well then I'll say, "You know what? I put in too much time for writing. An hour of writing is too much. Maybe I should just start with 45 minutes. Let's see if I can do that block. I'll adjust it a little bit because I got other stuff that I want to take care of." So, it's those small adjustments within day-to-day, whereas before I wrote Indistractable, it was all kinds of stuff. It was half the day that I would go off track.

Lenny (01:23:07):
Amazing. I was going to ask what it was like beforehand. Nir, I think we delivered on our promise. There's at least a dozen very tactical things you can do to become more indistractable and to focus better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about the stuff you're doing? Where do they buy your book? Where they learn more about the things you can do for them? And then finally, how can listeners be sold to you?

Nir Eyal (01:23:28):
I appreciate it. Thanks. So, my website is nirandfar.com. That's spelled like my first name, nirandfar.com. And my two books, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, and they're available wherever books are sold and what you can do for me, become indistractable. Honestly, I don't care if you buy the book. If you can adopt some of these practices and help change this mindset that we're all victims, that we're being hijacked because of the tech companies. If you can start putting the word out there that this is something that has improved your life in some small way and tell others about it, this is how we start spreading those social antibodies, just like my mom did around smoking. I think we should all do the same.

Lenny (01:24:09):
I am going to be working on that as soon as we get off. Nir, thank you so much for being here.

Nir Eyal (01:24:14):
Thank you.

# The happiness and pain of product management | Noam Lovinsky (Grammarly, FB, Thumbtack, YT)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
You've worked at so many great companies. At YouTube, when you joined, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:05):
There were many times where Google leadership reconsidered the acquisition and, "Should we sell YouTube?" if you can believe it or not.

Lenny (00:00:11):
At Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:15):
I remember in a board meeting, the new model really started to show legs and one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever seen.

Lenny (00:00:23):
When you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team trying to create a startup within a startup.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:29):
You're thinking on a different time horizon. If you're a large organization and you do some performance management process twice a year and you're 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive.

Lenny (00:00:39):
As the chief product officer of Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspelled?

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:47):
The.

Lenny (00:00:47):
You do T-E-H?

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:48):
T-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Oh man.

(00:00:53):
Today my guest is Noam Lovinsky. Noam is currently chief product officer at Grammarly. Previously, he was an early PM at YouTube where he spent five years leading the creator product experience and then the broader YouTube consumer product experience. He then went on to take on the chief product officer role at Thumbtack, which involved helping the company reignite growth after a downturn caused by some changes Google made in SEO. He then went on to Facebook where he created the New Product Experimentation team whose charter was to incubate big new ideas protected from the larger Facebook org.

(00:01:26):
Noam has such a unique set of experiences taking products from 0 to 1, from -1 to 1, from 1 to 100, and even starting his own companies. He's never really been on a podcast before and he rarely ever tweets or post anything online, which we actually talk about. In our conversation, we walk through the lessons that he's learned through his amazing career at YouTube, Facebook, Thumbtack, and at Grammarly. We talk about when it makes sense to kill your project at a company, when it makes sense to ask to be layered at a company, why you should be keeping a nose out for which products matter most at a business and to find those products, why you need to diversify your growth channels at your business, why you should be finding work that is going to most stretch you to help you advance in your career, a bunch of advice for creating space for innovation within a large company and so much more. Noam is such a gem and I'm really excited to share his wisdom with you.

(00:04:22):
Noam, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Noam Lovinsky (00:04:25):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:27):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've heard so many great things about you from so many people. I think you're friends with a lot of guests that have been on this podcast. Something that I find really interesting about you and really respect about you is that you've worked at so many great companies and you've done so many big things in your career, but you barely ever tweet. You don't have a newsletter. I don't see many things on LinkedIn. I don't think you've even been on a podcast before. I think the only evidence I can find that you exist is you have this YouTube channel that's just like you go-karting and kids and people wishing you a happy birthday.

Noam Lovinsky (00:05:00):
Oh gosh, I should go monitor that. I forgot about that.

Lenny (00:05:05):
You might want to go find it now.

Noam Lovinsky (00:05:09):
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's funny. Yeah, it's funny. I think about that a lot, like am I doing something wrong? Should I be putting more effort in that? I mean, it's funny that you mentioned newsletter. I spend a lot of time with the Substack team's. I've been a very active advisor there. The team is fantastic by the way. And I think about it. Am I doing something wrong in my career by not doing that? But just to be honest, it doesn't come authentically to me. It doesn't come naturally to me. I get really focused on the thing that I'm working on and get really deep in the thing that I am working on and I have a hard time kind of multitasking a lot outside of that to be totally honest. The way that I kind of get to know the industry and other teams or whatnot is just through working with people.

(00:05:58):
I'm not a very big networker. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that. I wish I were better at that. I get to know people by doing work with them, by helping them. And it doesn't necessarily scale in the same way that Twitter does, but it's served me well so far and it's more kind of authentic and it's what comes more natural to me. And so that's how I do it. So I'm doing a lot of coffees. I'm meeting people that way. I'm not doing a lot of tweeting or writing of newsletters. Maybe one day, but that's not me today.

Lenny (00:06:31):
So I think this is an awesome example of you can be incredibly successful as a product manager and as anyone in tech not investing time posting online. I am going to incriminate myself here, but I feel like the advice I always share with people is the best people are not spending time tweeting and talking online and sharing on LinkedIn. They're just doing the work. They don't have time for that sort of thing. And I think you're a great example of that. Is there anything along those lines that you share with folks that are just like, "Hey, should I be investing time here?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:06:59):
I think everyone can chart their own path and has a way that is sort of authentic to them and leans on their strengths. What I often coach people is, do what you like. You're generally going to be a lot better at the things that really fill you up that really get you excited. Life is short. There's so many things to be doing out there. We're so lucky. The number of interesting waves of technology that I've experienced, it just makes me feel like it's going to keep happening for a long time. We're very fortunate to be born in the time that we are and have the opportunities that we are. So why spend your time doing something that doesn't feel good because you think that it might lead to some success, where if you lean on what's authentic to you and what makes you happy, chances are you're going to be one of the best people at those things?

Lenny (00:07:49):
I love that advice. And I think it's so important. I think there's a lot of pressure on people too. "I need to do this, I need to do that."

Noam Lovinsky (00:07:49):
Totally.

Lenny (00:07:55):
"I need to tweet, I need to share content to be successful." This comes up a lot in this podcast, that the more you could just stick close to what gives you energy and what you enjoy doing, oftentimes that leads to things you wouldn't expect in a lot of success.

(00:08:07):
Speaking of that, looking at your career arc, I noticed a really interesting pattern and a really diverse set of experiences. So just kind of talking through places you've been. At Facebook, you worked on 0 to 1 stuff. At YouTube, the way I see it as you almost went from -1 to 1. At Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1. So it's like a really unique turnaround story. And then with Grammarly it feels like it's like, I don't know, 1 or I don't know, 5 to 100, or wherever you end up taking it. So I thought it'd be fun to talk through each of these experiences because they're such unique approaches or such unique experiences and see what lessons and wisdom we can extract from your journey.

Noam Lovinsky (00:08:51):
That sounds great. Yeah.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Okay, sweet. So I'm thinking reverse chronologically, we start with YouTube, which the way I see it is it's kind of -1 to 1. When you join, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money. When you left, they were not losing money. And I was actually just looking, they're valued apparently at $200 billion today, YouTube as a business. I know you haven't been there for a while, but great work. What lessons did you take away from that journey? What stories come to mind from that part of your career that might be helpful to people?

Noam Lovinsky (00:09:21):
Maybe first to start looking with why hop around these experiences. I always tell people I feel like I'm an IC trapped in a manager's body sometimes. Fundamentally, I like to build, that's why I do this. I like to make things. And so sometimes the more fun way to make things is to start something and sometimes the better way to make things in the situation that I'm in is to try to support teams and lead through teams.

(00:09:50):
And so I joined YouTube through an acquisition of a company I started. In the beginning, what I was doing there is just rebuilding that product on Google infrastructure and for YouTube customers. And maybe the first lesson was actually to look around at what the rest of the team was doing and be really honest and open about the relative priority of the thing that you're working on even if it might lead to your project getting canceled.

(00:10:26):
So one of the things that I remember doing really on is actually talking to the leadership team and being like, "I don't think we should be putting 50 engineers on this project. Looking at the rest of the roadmap and the rest of the priorities, excuse me, I think this team would likely be better served elsewhere." Even though that was likely negotiating my way out of a job in month three, I don't know, I kind of felt like that was the right thing for the team and for the business.

(00:10:57):
And then that started a very interesting journey because from there, basically the leadership was like, "You're right. We're going to wind that down and build some of those features into the existing product. And now you, you come and lead this focus area, we're calling the creator focus area." So I went from basically rebuilding the product that our startup had built to leading one of the three focus areas at YouTube. There was the viewer team, the creator team, and the advertiser team. And Hunter Walk, who's amazing, was leading the viewer team. And Shishir Mehrotra, who's also very amazing, was leading the advertising team.

Lenny (00:11:39):
What an alumni community.

Noam Lovinsky (00:11:41):
There was me. I was sort of like 29-year-old startupy guy working with these guys who were awesome. And YouTube in general, and continues to be, an incredible team. And so I think that was a first really good lesson. That in the right organizations, even in large organizations, advocate for what's best for the team, advocate for what's best for the organization even if that means that it puts you at a particular difficult moment. If it is a healthy team that rewards those sorts of decisions and actions, good things will happen. If it's not, that's good to know too. That's good to know early. So that's one thing that comes to mind.

(00:12:32):
Maybe one other I would say atypical career choice that I made shortly thereafter is then when I was put in that role, I really struggled in that role. I was reporting to the CEO at the time, a guy named Salar Kamangar, who's also awesome, Google's 6th employee and just learned a ton from him, like an incredible strategic thinker. But he was asking me questions that I felt like they were from a different planet. I was like, I didn't know what they meant and he just thought in a different way, a different level or different scale and that's still something that I was learning. Eventually I figured it out, but I was really struggling in that moment. I had a really good relationship with both Hunter and Shishir and they really helped me through that. And eventually, I went to Salar and said, "Hey, I think I should actually report to Hunter. I think this would work better if we kind of combined the organizations this way and then we divided and conquered this way."

(00:13:41):
And again, very atypical, no one has ever come to me in my career and said, "I would like you to layer me in this other person." But in that moment I was just like, "This is how I will do better work. This is how I will get better support. I will be happier and more productive and it'll be better for the team." And you know what? For me anyway, I was right. We made that change. Hunter was a fantastic manager and support at YouTube. I learned a ton, grew a lot. And then eventually when he moved on, Shishir took over the organization and then I moved into the viewer part of the organization, which is where I spent the rest of my time there, which was leading and supporting the viewer PM team at YouTube.

Lenny (00:14:32):
These stories are amazing. It connects to your point that you're kind of an, I see, an inner child I see, where you keep trying to kill your career by accident. Like, "Now, let's kill this project I'm working on. I'm going to demote myself a little bit." But clearly it's worked out. Is there anything that you saw that gave you that confidence that, "This is actually going to be okay"? Because again, people don't normally think this is how you get ahead in your career, is you kill your team and you layer yourself.

Noam Lovinsky (00:14:58):
Yeah, I mean I think having a broader view of the company strategy, having an instinct for what we should be doing and why and how I might prioritize all of these investments if I were given the opportunity to do that, I think internalizing that and understanding that and then trying to align whatever is under your influence towards that overall goal is very helpful and made me feel like, "I'm pretty confident this is going to be okay because it will lead to better results for the organization given what we're trying to do. And so as long as I'm trying to push decisions or actions that actually lead to better results, if it's a healthy culture and organization, I should be okay."

(00:15:47):
I think that the other thing is, just over the years, I got extremely lucky. The first job that I got out of school was an incredible group of people and it gave me a nose for talent. It gave me a nose for what great feels like and what a high functioning team feels like. It's hard to know that without experiencing that. And so in the moments, YouTube was also one of those teams, Grammarly is one of those teams, Thumbtack was one of those teams. Being able to sniff that out when you're trying to choose the next team is very important. But I think that's another thing that gave me confidence. I learned these people well enough, Hunter, Shishir, et cetera, to have the instinct that the right thing will happen, like this will be better for me and the broader team.

Lenny (00:16:49):
Got it. So the key there is just you have to trust that the team around you is good enough, that you're not going to be pushed off into a corner. I think you made a really profound point here that a lot of people don't get about the job of a product leader and a product manager, that a big part of your job is to think about what is best for the business and work backwards from that. Not necessarily what's the best thing for the user is the highest priority, not necessarily what's the best thing for my team and how do I hit the goals that I'm obsessed with. It's what is going to be best for the business broadly and then make decisions there. Is there anything more you can say there about just how powerful that is as a way of thinking about prioritization and decisions as a product manager?

Noam Lovinsky (00:17:31):
Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I think ideally, things that are best for the customer, there's high overlap with that with things that are best for the business, but not always, right? And I think figuring out some principles that help guide those sorts of conflicts can be really, really helpful. At Thumbtack, we had principles about which sides of the marketplace we wanted to serve in which order and when we serve Thumbtack. So it was customers first, pros second, and then Thumbtack last. And that's actually the first two... Saying Thumbtack last is the easy thing to say. Actually doing it in action I think is a very different thing. But that first one of like, should we... Especially when you're starting a marketplace, as you know well, Lenny, supply is so critical. Many marketplaces live and die by the quality and liquidity and supply. And so why would you focus on customers first and the Thumbtack perspective and supply are the pros, the people that you hire?

(00:18:41):
Well, we always just felt that what the pros need from us is more customers. What the pros need from us is high quality customers. And so if we really try to make a great customer experience that attracts more customers, helps them find the right pros, provides the highest quality customers, then that will therefore be better for the pros. And so that's how we should prioritize. If we do those things right, then the business will benefit, right? And so doing things like raising prices because we think it's good for the business, even though it causes liquidity issues in the marketplace might be a little bit of a local maxima, locally optimizing rather than globally optimizing. So I think sometimes in these sorts of questions, trying to establish some set of guiding principles that help navigate some of these more ambiguous or thorny questions can be really helpful.

Lenny (00:19:38):
I want to circle back to this first point you made, an experience you had convincing people that your first project shouldn't be something you work on. How long do you stick with something that isn't going well and then decide, "Okay, let's convince people this is something I should move on from," versus you don't want to give up on a project quickly, you want to give it a shot?

Noam Lovinsky (00:19:56):
I mean, look, I don't know that it's a perfect answer, but I think the reality is just that what kills most projects most early companies is stamina. And I think that we all need to work on being more resilient about kind of like, I remember at Thumbtack, Marco, the CEO, we used to say that it feels like we're running uphill and chewing glass, and you're kind of like, "That's right, we want to do that. That's good for us. Take our medicine." So you want to practice that sort of resiliency. But ultimately, I think that what starts to happen is you start to lose the stamina and you're just not bringing your best self to the situation.

(00:20:42):
And so many of these things that are so high ambiguity where you don't know exactly what to build or you don't know exactly, you're not getting the signal you need or the feedback you need to be able to hone it in and know that you're doing something well. They require just an ungodly level of faith and stamina. And so that's sort of what I look to. When you see a team that is motivated, that is building something like they're really excited about, I mean just the inertia, the quality, it's like a whole different game where when you see a team that's sort of down and out and they've really been hitting their head against the wall for a long time, sometimes they just need a change of scene, a change of pace, and they get to a much better situation. So my honest answer is, yeah, it's the, when do you run out of steam is usually the question. I think that happens usually like in the startup case, a lot of times before you run out money or these other things.

Lenny (00:21:48):
We've talked about Thumbtack a couple of times now, so let's talk about that. I love this description of running a pill, chewing glass. My understanding is when you joined, things were going well, and then things started to go much less well, and then you helped turn things around. Talk about that part of your journey and what you learned from that time.

Noam Lovinsky (00:22:05):
Yeah, sure. Again, really fantastic team and really strong founders. That company was just on the bleeding edge of things like SEO and growing by SEO. It was one of the best organizations that are driving growth through that channel. But I think a thing that I learned really early, which Lenny with your background you probably know as well, SEO is a sort of a live by the sword, die by the sword channel of growth. I think that one channel growth company is always a no-no. And so that's a little bit of what we had at Thumbtack.

(00:22:44):
So it was funny, because I remember when I joined and Marco and I had an agreement where it's like, "Okay, I'm going to do my three months of onboarding, listening to our new leader inheriting a team." I've always gotten advice that that's what you should do. And Marco being an entrepreneur and a hard running founder is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure." And then a month in, it's like, "All right, we got to run 2024 planning. Go." Or not 2024, sorry, at the time it was. And yeah, in the early days when I was there, Thumbtack was seeing triple digit growth. Then we had a couple SEO hits that got us down to double-digit growth. And then not too long after that, we were actually, for the first time in the company's history, seeing negative year-over-year growth and Google was just really coming down on our category as we were, by the way, trying to rebuild the whole product and change the monetization model and everything in between.

(00:23:50):
So it was a really a tough moment of how much do we kind of spend to reinforce the old model while we're sort of building the new model, kind of changing the engine while the plane is flying. I think I remember in a board meeting, once we kind of turned that around and over time and also the new model really started to show legs and really started to work, one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever, ever seen. It was obviously a really proud moment there.

(00:24:24):
But I think that the thing that I took away from that, which I tell PMs quite a bit, is growth masks all problems. You don't really have a, I think, true understanding of what is working well and what is not working well when you have incredible growth. YouTube was a great example of that. And at Thumbtac, it had incredible growth for quite some time, but it was essentially burning through a lot of demand. It was just dropping a lot of demand on the floor because there wasn't sufficient liquidity on the supply side to really meet that demand. The team knew and was trying to work on that problem, but it wasn't as urgent or high priority because you're having triple digit growth. What's wrong? Everything's going great, right?

(00:25:11):
And then the moment growth starts to slow or certainly when growth starts to be negative, all of a sudden the tenor in the organization really changes and you start looking at things very differently and trying to understand what's actually going on. And so I think it's actually a very healthy thing for businesses to go through as they turn into long-term sustainable businesses to have those sorts of moments, because I think otherwise it's just really challenging to identify where the true issues are. And I think as a PM, if you've only ever worked on things that grow and you've never felt the other side of that and how to help turn that around with your team, I think you lose a lot in your career if you don't experience that.

(00:25:58):
I'm kind of naturally paranoid. And especially as I manage growth, I often look at things and ask myself like, "Okay, what do I do right now if it went negative? How would I prioritize things if it went negative?" Having gone through that experience, I just look at things in a different way of urgency. I look at things at different levels of priority having gone through that experience.

Lenny (00:26:25):
With this Thumbtack story, I think it's rare that a business gets the smile graph that you described, this prettiest smile graph that this board member has ever seen. I think that is rarely the case. Usually, it doesn't come back up. Can you share what you did to help Thumbtack turn things around? I know it's very particular to Thumbtack in the business, but just anything there that would be useful to people?

Noam Lovinsky (00:26:46):
Sure. First of all, this is very much the team. It's not just things that I did. So I mean, first was turning on multiple channels of growth. Up until then, Thumbtack had tried and stopped paid channels, other organic channels like referrals, all of the typical things. And so, we just went back to first principles on a lot of that and also just kind of reformed a team around that and basically got an amazing team together. One of them, Whitney Steele is running marketing at Descript now. Another one, David Schein is running a product at HIMSS. But basically I went back to first principles on some of those growth channels and experiment on our way to much, much better results.

(00:27:42):
I think that one of the things that we were doing incorrectly at Thumbtack is Thumbtack is actually a marketplace that is actually made up of thousands of marketplaces, right? Like DJs in Philadelphia is one marketplace, DJs in Atlanta is another marketplace, contractors in Sonoma is another marketplace. And then Thumbtack is obviously the container of all of those marketplaces. I think we were just bifurcating our targeting and our growth efforts a little too narrowly, assuming we had to grow in that way market by market rather than targeting more broadly, providing the more aggregate data to Google and others, and then optimizing from there. The fact that we already had really good showing in SEO and really good patriarch and SEO helped to bolster things like SEM and then eventually Facebook as well.

(00:28:40):
Those were kind of the growth levers, but the core issue with the Thumbtack product was that it was just a very high friction customer experience that really left customers waiting. So the way that Thumbtack worked basically was a customer would find them through a search query, they would come in and they would answer a number of questions about the job they needed done, and then Thumbtack would say, "Okay, great, we'll get back to you in 24 hours." And this is a modern day experience, right?

(00:29:17):
And then what Thumbtack would do is they would take that job and they would federate it out to as many of the pros that might match the criteria, and then the pros would pay to quote to show up as a potential provider for that job. Now, I don't want to take anything away from that team because that worked phenomenally well for a really long time. And actually it's a perfect case study in like, "|Just do the scrappy thing that works to grow." And they did that very well, but the stage and size of the business when I joined it had kind of outgrown that. And the team knew that. That's obviously a very high friction experience. The idea that the customer, they're super excited, they want to hire someone, and at that moment you'd be like, "Cool, talk to you soon," not the best experience.

(00:30:06):
And the fact that you're asking your supply to put up money to even show up to customers in the first place, well, what the customers want to see is the supply. Like, "Tell me who I can hire." Also, a lot of friction on that side and also in some cases some unfair revenue on that side because if folks are paying to be seen and maybe they're looked at, but there's not really high intent, then they're not going to get the customers they want, they're going to be spending revenue, they're not going to be getting revenue back. It turns into just a bad loop obviously.

(00:30:40):
So the main thing we did is to rebuild that whole loop, change the monetization model, build a system where essentially pros could provide instant quotes. Lenny, I'm sure from Airbnb, this is very familiar, the move from request to book to instant booking. It was a very similar thing in a different kind of category of service and supply obviously. But that shift and doing that shift across those thousands of marketplaces and then finding the right friction point for monetization and when and what to charge people for and all of that change, that is what really, at its core, turned the growth engine around at Thumbtack. And it's just a real testament to those founders that they believe that, saw that, and were willing to run a pill and chew glass to get to that point. I don't know the details of the business anymore. And if I did, I wouldn't speak to it. But from what I hear, things are going well, so I think that that served the company well.

Lenny (00:31:45):
Yeah, as you were talking about that, that's exactly an experience Airbnb went through. I actually led that effort at Airbnb. It took three years of my life.

Noam Lovinsky (00:31:53):
Oh my gosh, we should talk about that one day.

Lenny (00:31:57):
Yeah, I've written about it here and there, but honestly very quietly is one of the biggest transformations Airbnb went through, shifting from I'm going to go request a book to basically every book now on Airbnb is instant. And that was a very difficult and painful journey. But looking back, I don't think Airbnb would've made it if not for that. And unlike Thumbtack, we did it before things were starting to fall apart. And actually, I was going to say the lens that we used that I find really helpful here is, you should be asking yourself, "If somebody was to come into our space and disrupt us and start now to become the new Airbnb, what would they do?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:32:33):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:32:34):
And it was obvious that it'd be be make it instant, just the way it works. Welcome to Airbnb disruptor. And so, yeah.

Noam Lovinsky (00:32:40):
Another learning there is any product you work on that involves bits and atoms is exponentially harder than products that just involve bits. But it's amazing how something as seemingly simple as make an instant ends up being so incredibly deep and complicated. And especially on an existing business, making that transition while still growing is just very, very complicated. Fantastic learning I'm sure you had as well.

Lenny (00:33:07):
Very difficult to change people's expectations and behavior. This could be its own podcast episode, just changing marketplaces into an instant experience.

(00:33:14):
I wanted to circle back real quick to the first lesson you had there, which is adding new channels. I think this is a really interesting takeaway here. So essentially Thumbtack was reliant on SEO. Google slash the sword, as you described, started changing things so traffic stopped coming. I think a cool lesson here is just if you're reliant on one growth channel, which I think most companies actually are, I think most companies have one main driver, I think a lesson here is potentially before things start to fall apart, especially if you're SEO-driven, start to explore more practically paid referrals.

Noam Lovinsky (00:33:46):
Totally. I mean I think maybe it's, again, it's kind of living through that. Now, anytime I look at a product or look at a team, it's one of the first things that perks up the paranoia of just like, "Oh no. You don't want to be in that situation. Let's figure out now how you start to diversify because you just never know, like you say, when one of those might dry up."

Lenny (00:34:09):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn.

(00:34:20):
LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2 to 5X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:35:29):
Is there anything else from your time at Thumbtack that stands out as an interesting lesson or takeaway that you bring with you to the work you do now?

Noam Lovinsky (00:35:37):
I would say this, I think especially at the leadership level, the team that reports to the CEO, that group doesn't always have the opportunity to do a lot of project work together, right? You've got your CFO, you've got your head of sales, you've got your product and your engineering. There's just not as often as natural ways for that group to work together. And then when something happens like growth goes negative, that group is very important. And that group's ability to tackle hard things together is very important. I think that one important lesson from that is, no one can be a bystander on product strategy. Just because you've got product in your title doesn't mean you're the only one that should be thinking about product strategy certainly at that level. Certainly not in engineering.

(00:36:39):
The CFO, the head of people, everyone needs to have a seat at the table when it comes to product strategy, what the company's doing and what they're going to do to grow out of the situation that they're in. Because otherwise, in those hard times it can kind of be like a, "What have you done for me lately?" sort of a dynamic. And that's just not the right dynamic to have on that team. I'm not saying that at Thumbtack we had the right dynamic, but I think it was a really important learning in that moment of how that team, even if they didn't typically get as involved in things like product strategy and what we're building, how everyone had to be all hands on deck and really thinking about those sorts of problems because it's the only way I think you can get a whole company and team out of those situations by everyone getting involved in doing their part and pulling on the levers that they have in their area in order to do that well. I don't think it can work in any other way.

Lenny (00:37:38):
So there's a lesson there. Build a relationship with the leadership team before things start to go awry.

Noam Lovinsky (00:37:44):
That, yes. Certainly that, but I think it's also incumbent for people in our roles and engineering roles to bring strategy to that discussion, to that group, in a way that it is possible for everyone to engage and everyone to internalize and understand what it means for their area and to even have obviously a say in because they're on the leadership team at the end of the day. They should feel like their fingerprint is also on the company strategy, and as soon as it starts to feel like that's their world, that's our world. And I think that's true for any of the functions. It's true for what's happening in sales, it's true for what's happening in marketing. As product managers, we naturally need to be the connective tissue across all of that, but I think the whole leadership team at that level should feel like connective tissue across all of those functions.

Lenny (00:38:39):
Okay. Let's transition to Facebook. This is I think an example of 0 to 1. So when you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team. I actually thought it was called the New Product Experiment Experience team, but I think it's New Product Experimentation team. My understanding is the idea there is, instead of Facebook having to buy the next Instagram and WhatsApp and all the things basically incubate startups within Facebook in a stabled concept, a startup within a startup, create all these startups within a startup. And as an outsider, it feels like it was really fun for a while, but it hasn't let any amazing new businesses for Facebook. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm curious what that experience was like, what you took away from it, how it went, what you think about when you look back at that part of your journey.

Noam Lovinsky (00:39:28):
I was one of the few folks that kind of joined that team early and help build that team. How it ended up and how it closed down, I am not familiar with because I wasn't there. But I think in terms of was it a success or not because it didn't build the next Instagram I think is a little bit of the wrong bar to set for things like that. To some extent, it's like, "Did the group win the lottery or not? And let's judge there. Let's judge their success." Obviously I'm not saying that discovering something like Instagram is just winning the lottery, but you get what I mean in terms of the rarity of those sorts of discoveries and those sorts of products.

(00:40:12):
I think that that team was very realistic about what I would say would be the champagne level outcomes and/or more like the kind of beer, nice dinner kind of level outcomes.

Lenny (00:40:28):
Your wine.

Noam Lovinsky (00:40:29):
Yeah, the wine. Yeah, thank you. That's a better analogy. I think we built knowing those sorts of outcomes would also be very beneficial to the organization. So as an example, one of them is, at Facebook scale, doing things that don't scale or doing things that start out small was just a muscle that was really hard to come by, right? It's like any community product that you build, any kind of social where there's community density that's important early on, any product that you build that way, starting with a million users is a really hard way to do that. At places like Facebook and Google, it's like it's hard to run an experiment with a hundred people. It's not hard, it's impossible, right? And so this idea that you would have to get real small, that you would have to start very targeted, that you would have to start with things that clearly don't scale and don't have a chance of being big from the get-go is really, really hard in an organization like that.

(00:41:47):
And so creating that space for NPE to be able to do that, to be able to help remind the organization what are the mechanisms we need to be able to build and learn that way was very beneficial. Even simple things. At an organization of Facebook size, maybe experiences at an Airbnb, it is really hard for product managers, engineers and designers to talk directly with customers. It is basically impossible. You're almost always talking through some third party, some recruiting agency and getting reports and you're not always in the room. Imagine building a startup, like a product from day one and not being able to sit right next to your customer and being like, "Show me how you do this or show me how you do that.' It's incredibly hard. You're looking for such faint signal.

(00:42:48):
The idea that you would try to get it through layers of indirection and games of telephone is crazy, but at that scale, that's what you have to do because there's all of these legal concerns and many other realistic concerns about what you can say to who and who you can talk to and what you can tell them about what you're doing and all of these things. So creating an environment where those sorts of constraints were lifted and were different was very beneficial, I think, to the organization and started to shed a light on some of the things that were broken that make it hard to build 0 to 1 in those sorts of environments.

(00:43:31):
I also think it was a really fantastic recruiting tool. It did build a really great group of folks, many of which have left to go start interesting companies. But I guess what I'm trying to say is I think when you're an organizational leader, and Schrep was the org leader that was supporting NP at the time and he's fantastic and really did a good job of firewalling that team, I think you're looking at a set of objectives and a number of ways that you might help the company and the organization. Even if you set that light on the hill to be like, "Go find the next Instagram," many of the things that you would do along the way to find the next Instagram end up being very beneficial to the broader organization. We saw a lot of that in PE.

Lenny (00:44:28):
That's a really interesting perspective. There's a lot of other goals with something like this, it's not just find the next massive business. It's the way I think what I'm getting from this is shine almost a mirror on the organization, like, "Here's the things we can't do with the regular business and we have to do something. We have to set this up in order to try something totally new and radical recruiting tool" I think is interesting.

(00:44:49):
There's actually a team at Airbnb, the way I described it was, I don't know how many people know about Burning Man and how it works, but there's this trash fence around the side that catches all the trash so it doesn't go into the desert. And I feel like there's teams sometimes that are the trash fence of the company.

Noam Lovinsky (00:45:04):
That's funny, yeah.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Where someone's about to leave and they're like, "No, go work on this coal stuff over here in the fringe," which is really interesting. But just instill within the company and maybe help with that. Just keep people that are awesome at Meta. [inaudible 00:45:16].

Noam Lovinsky (00:45:16):
Yeah. You're right that the team didn't discover the next Instagram. For what it's worth, things like Threads and ideas like Threads were in that team all of the time. I think that if that team caught the wave of generative AI and all of the opportunities and new technologies there, I think things could have also... Because those are certain moments where you having small, really motivated, dedicated teams that aren't thinking about anything mainline can lead to faster discoveries, I think that can also help. But there were a number of things that basically ended up becoming features in other products and they were just easier, faster ways of validating and building them because you didn't have the constraints of the mainline product development organization, right?

Lenny (00:46:07):
For someone that is thinking about trying to create a startup within a startup, something a lot of big companies are trying to do, is there a piece of advice or two that you'd share for helping this be effective? Maybe one is just the goal may not be build the next big business. There's these sub goals also. What comes to mind?

Noam Lovinsky (00:46:26):
God, there's so many. Schrep did a really fantastic job of removing a lot of these constraints. So one is I would say think really hard about the incentive system. Smart, good people, even if they're not trying to, they end up kind of gaming things towards the incentive system. And so think long and hard about that. So for instance, if you're a large organization and you do some performance management process like twice a year and that's how you're going to evaluate and incentivize people in your 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive, it's the wrong timeframe. It creates adverse selection, problems for the sort of people that you bring in. And so it's hard in an existing organization to say, "We're going to take all these company processes around even how we level people and pay them and motivate them. And we're going to throw them out the window for this group."

(00:47:27):
How you build the infrastructure you use, this is something that the NP team did really well. Everyone got to do their own thing from an infrastructure perspective. Just do what is best for the problem you're trying to solve in this moment, knowing that you're likely going to throw away a lot of this code anyway. Being able to do that in an organization like Facebook or Google, if you ask anyone that works on those things, is really hard. It takes someone like a Schrep to be like, "Nope, they're going to get to do this. Sorry." And so I think that's really helpful.

(00:48:01):
For what it's worth, one of the organizations that we talked to that I felt like was doing this in one of the best ways was Nike. Nike has this incubation lab. It's a completely different operating model. They recruit a completely different type of person, very different incentive system. And essentially, where they end up plugging them into Nike is that when they have something into the distribution marketing kind of growth arms of Nike. But for the product discovery process, they're doing their whole different thing. Once they find some fit, then kind of Nike comes in and goes, "Boom. I'm going to help you explode your fit." But I think that the number one thing I would think about would be the incentive system and the adverse selection that that can cause.

Lenny (00:48:52):
To me, the most important element of the incentive system, and maybe I'm reading between the lines, is you're basically competing against them starting their own thing. And having upside if things go super well feels really important versus, "I'm just going to get a cool salary at Meta and work on this thing." That doesn't lead to the same experience as a startup where everything's on the line.

Noam Lovinsky (00:49:10):
Yeah. And also what time horizons, right? When you're starting a company, you're not thinking like, "In the next six months, I'm going to get a promo and I'm going to get a good rating and things are going to go well." You're thinking on a different, excuse me, time horizon, and you're thinking about an outsized impact or an outsized incentive. And so I would think about that if you're starting things internally as well.

Lenny (00:49:34):
Awesome. Okay. Let's move to the final bucket, Grammarly, which is where you're at now. The way I'm thinking about it is this kind of like a one, two rocket ship or I don't know, 10. It's further along than one, but that's where you're at now. To me, Grammarly is interesting because it's one of the very few successful B2C subscription businesses. There's almost none. There's Duolingo, Grammarly. And I know you're doing B2B also, but there's so few. There's so many dead bodies trying to build a business on top of consumer subscription. And so I'm just curious. What the current state of Grammarly? How are things going? What do you think has been the key to it being successful all this time and continuing to grow? And what lessons have you learned? I know you just joined relatively recently, but anything you've taken away from that journey so far?

Noam Lovinsky (00:50:26):
We don't talk about it often, but Grammarly is a much bigger company from a revenue perspective than I think people realize. The company has been around for 15 years and was profitable from day one, and continues to be quite profitable. So it's a very, very healthy business that is much larger than folks might realize. And that is actually quite intentional because the company was trying not to be noticed for a long time, very intentionally. The fact that you would have grammar and spell checking in Google Docs or grammar and spell checking in Word. People would often write off the company that like, "How is that a business? How is that a feature? These products already have it." And that was very convenient for Grammarly because they could kind of navigate between these giants in tech and grow a very phenomenal business on this use case that people had written off.

(00:51:30):
Now, come the advent of LMS, it's no longer a use case that people are writing off and sort of the dream of the founders that machines can assist us in communication in this way that they've had for 15 years, I feel like now the whole industry is like, "Well, this is obviously how we're going to communicate and machines are going to do all these things for us." And Grammarly is now sort of in the center of that hurricane. And again, I think it's a similar thing where it's like, "Well, there's ChatGPT. There's Microsoft Copilot. How is Grammarly going to have a chats?" But yet things still seem like there's the future. The future is bright.

(00:52:14):
And so to your question, I think what has made it work, I've only been here for 10 months so please kind of take this with a grain of salt, but my instinct is that people really love Grammarly because of how it works and where it works. And what I mean by how it works is Grammarly is one of the few products where you just install it and it makes you better. You don't have to configure it, you don't have to manipulate it, you don't have to change anything about what you're doing. You carry on and across all of your applications, across all of your tabs, you'll start getting pushed assistance to you in the right moment. You could ignore it if you want, no big deal, but it takes a very, very small amount of effort to tap on one of those things, get some value and keep going.

(00:53:04):
I think that a product that is that easy to use, that easy to extract value from, but then also that prevalent, how many different text boxes do you write in a given day? I mean, it is not less than 10, it is tens or potentially hundreds, right? And so it is everywhere and it is very, very low effort to get real value from it. And then the where we work is what I said, you don't have to change anything about your workflow. Grammarly meets you where you are and you get value from it. Doing that really well at this level of quality for a user base of this scale, essentially it's like a huge AI achievement masquerading as a little UX innovation, right? But that experience, that UX that sort of brings AI to the masses has obviously served Grammarly really well. I think those are some of the strengths that we're going to continue to lean on to now provide a very different type of assistance and value that we can because of where the technology has moved.

Lenny (00:54:21):
The other thing I've heard a lot about Grammarly, and Yuri was on the podcast and who led growth for a long time at Grammarly, is just how scrappy the business has been and the founders have been from the beginning, the fact that they've been profitable from the beginning. That feels like one of the threads through all of the successful consumer subscription companies, is super scrappy, not raising money for a long time. Is there anything there that you found to be really interesting or helpful for other folks that are maybe building the space?

Noam Lovinsky (00:54:46):
When you're a team that kind of starts out of Ukraine and you're not thinking that there's any chance that you're going to raise money and why would you do that, I mean it really... Back to our previous conversation of what happens when growth goes negative, it really forces you to focus on the important things. And so, like many of the early engineers who are still here because the company has done so well over the years, they think in like, "How is this work going to translate into revenue?" They think about the impact on the business from even very deep technical work that they're doing because I think they were brought up in this culture where the business doesn't really invest ahead of its profitability because it was a bootstrap business from day one. So that enforces everyone to think about their projects and their prioritization and how is what they're doing over the next two months going to actually turn into more revenue and keep the company growing and sustaining. So I think that culture is prevalent and help Grammarly get to where it is.

(00:56:00):
Now, I just want to be really honest that in moments that we're in like today, that can also be detrimental because the business gets to a certain size, you start getting to law of large numbers. You need to start thinking about are there other products? Are there other use cases? Are there other channels of growth? How do you invest ahead of some of that growth and start to diversify? Because at the scale and size that we are and aspire to be, we're going to have to do many more things and service many more different types of customers. And as you mentioned, we're going to have to pull off the motion of B2C to B, kind of get that product-led sales motion going. So all of those things are happening. And thankfully the business is as strong as it is where we can invest ahead now in those things while still maintaining profitability and a really strong business.

Lenny (00:56:57):
That's amazing that they're still team members and maybe I think you said engineers from the beginning, 12 years later. I think that says a lot about the business. And before we started recording, they're based in Ukraine and you were saying that they're going to Zooms, there's bombs going off, they have to go into bomb shelters and then jump on a meeting. It's incredible that team continues to operate and the business continues to do this well in spite of all that.

Noam Lovinsky (00:57:22):
Yeah, the team in Ukraine at Grammarly is... I mean, it's something else. It's a really fantastic team. When you speak to many of them, I think actually the work provides sometimes a very useful distraction, but they obviously feel a lot of pride in the business. They built a lot of this business. There aren't yet many businesses of this size that kind of come from Ukraine. I think that that team is incredible and continues to deliver a ton of impact to the company even in the circumstances that they're in. I know for the founders, a lot of why they want Grammarly to succeed and be the generational company that it can be is for Ukraine, and especially in this moment and it's awesome to see how that motivates them and 15 years on the same project is not nothing. That's some serious resilience. And so I think even in moments like that, using them as a way to motivate and strive for something greater I think says a lot about the founders and the team in Ukraine.

Lenny (00:58:40):
Absolutely. Hopefully there's a happy resolution soon there. I don't know if you know this, I was actually born in Ukraine.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:47):
Oh wow.

Lenny (00:58:48):
I know Odessa.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:49):
Oh, nice.

Lenny (00:58:49):
I don't want to talk about that much, but it's true. And I just realized we both have skys in our last name. Lovinsky and Rachitsky.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:56):
So for what it's worth, my dad was born in Ukraine. He is from Kiev. My mom was from Lithuania, so yeah, I also have some Ukrainian background here.

Lenny (00:59:05):
All right, so Ukrainian episode.

Noam Lovinsky (00:59:07):
Yes.

Lenny (00:59:08):
Let me zoom out a little bit and get to the final couple questions. So thinking about your career broadly, I'm just curious if there's any general advice you share with people to help them have a more successful career. Anything that just generally you find is really important to do well or mistakes they make. And this is a big broad question, but anything come to mind of like, "Here's something you should really try to do more of or less of?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:59:37):
Look, when you're thinking about career opportunities and what job to take, it's really, really hard to sniff out really well in a high degree of certainty like success. I think that having a good nose for people and the sort of people that you can be successful with is something that you can develop. What I found is I always try to prioritize putting myself in positions that are going to cause a lot of growth and learning. And growth and learning can be very painful. And you kind of got to be okay with that and go into that because on the other side of that pain I think is the promised land.

(01:00:21):
And that's just served me really well, is I can't necessarily predict with high degree of certainty that this thing's going to hit, but I can get a sense of the people around me and I certainly can find situations that are going to stretch me, that are going to force me to do things that I haven't done where I'm going to grow and learn significantly. And over sort of the arc of my career, I feel like that's served me well. So that's usually what I tell people, is focus on on that if you can.

Lenny (01:00:53):
I love that advice. I've used this quote a number of times on this podcast, but something I always come back to is this line, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek." I'm curious if there's something you have found about when the pain is too much, that you shouldn't pursue that. A lot of people get into these places where their mental health gets hit, their physical health is hit, they're just doing work they should not, it's too much. Is there anything there that you find it's just like, "Okay, maybe this is too much of discomfort"?

Noam Lovinsky (01:01:24):
I mean, I think about a couple of things. I think in any situation you should be able to lean on one or two things that you're really strong at. That can be the foundation that keeps you going while you learn the other things. So just be wary of situations that are too net new.

(01:01:44):
There should be one or two important things as part of that job going into where you're like, "I got this. I know how to do this portion of it." So as an example, if you've never inherited a very large team and you work through how that works, but the product area that you're working on is one you're very familiar with what's necessary to be good in that product, whether it's really good sense of design or really good sense of analytical thinking, recommendation systems, what have you, there should be a couple of those things where you're like, "I got this. These things are going to be a stretch, but these things, I feel like I've got a handle on how to do this. I can always get better, but I feel like they're in my wheelhouse." And I think that tends to allow you to balance the pain with the areas that you already know and manage through in a more balanced and healthy way.

Lenny (01:02:48):
It reminds me of that chart I think from flow of you want it to be challenging but not too challenging, and that's where you end up being most successful. Is there anything else, Noam, you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:05):
Yeah, I just think that maybe going back to where we first started, Lenny, work on the things that make you happy, that fill you up. Life is short. We're all very lucky to be in this moment. There's no reason to spend time on things that don't give you energy. There's so much to do out there. I think that's the main thing I would focus on.

Lenny (01:03:29):
Amazing. And even though there will be things that you have to do, I think it's important to try to find as much of that as you can because not everyone can just like, "Nah, I'm not going to do this work thing. I'm just going to go on a walk." But I think that's such an important point. And we've talked about this actually a bunch on recent podcasts of just doing this energy audit where you pay attention to what gives you energy and what doesn't and try to do more and more [inaudible 01:03:54]-

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:53):
Totally.

Lenny (01:03:55):
... willing to do that again. With that, we reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:59):
Yeah, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:04:00):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Noam Lovinsky (01:04:06):
I'm going to cheat on this one and I'm only going to give you one. I'm only going to give you one because I don't want to cloud with any other. I recommend Build by Tony Fidel. Other than it being a good book, one of the main reasons I recommend it is that my wife wrote it. So she wrote it together with Tony. And I got to see that experience. She's a fantastic writer and Tony has a lot to learn from, so I recommend that book. I think that the part of it that was particularly inspiring to me to hear even more of the details that are in the book is just how many times he met failure before he made discoveries that are now driving so many of the things that we do. It's just a good reminder to keep at it and do the thing that really gives you that energy because eventually you can make that incredible discovery.

Lenny (01:05:00):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Noam Lovinsky (01:05:06):
I really like For All Mankind, if you've seen that on Apple TV. And then I just finished the last season of Fargo. Every single season of that series I think is fantastic.

Lenny (01:05:19):
Amazing. For All Mankind though, last season, not as amazing a consensus that I agree with, but worth watching.

(01:05:26):
Next question. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Noam Lovinsky (01:05:32):
I generally like interview questions that allow us to kind of do some work together, so I'm a little bit less on the behavioral "tell me about a time when" sort of stuff and more on the "Let's work a product problem together." It could be anything from like, "Let's design an alarm clock for children." Or lately I've been using one. "Given where technology is at, if we were to rebuild email, how might we do that?" I just feel like getting into it and getting into the details and really watching each other exercise our craft I think is really important. I have a whole podcast one time, if you're ready, about how most people don't know how to do leadership recruiting. And I feel like as I've advanced in my career, the interviews for some reason get easier and actually I can evaluate less about who I am as a product leader and whatnot. But yeah, those are the sorts of interview questions that I typically like.

Lenny (01:06:30):
Amazing. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:36):
It's not recent, but I was a very early user of Arc and I really love Arc.

Lenny (01:06:43):
Your window right now is inside Arc. I also love Arc. We had Josh on the podcast.

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:48):
Nice.

Lenny (01:06:49):
Just watching the onboarding experience of Arc alone as a product person is worth your time.

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:53):
Totally. I love the animation when you download something. I mean just like all of the little things. And if Josh is listening, we would like to get Grammarly to work better with Arc, so please hit me up because I think there's a few things that the Arc browser is doing that make it hard to get Grammarly to work either on the client or in the browser.

Lenny (01:07:10):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends or family either in work or in life that you find useful?

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:18):
Gosh, for those that know me, this is going to share so much of my personality. I think the first thing that comes to mind is, we are meant to struggle. I just feel like through struggle is how we get better, how good things happen, how bonds form, and so I don't shy away from that kind of life experience.

Lenny (01:07:39):
I'm going to guess that you're Jewish. I'm also Jewish. That feels like a very Jewish thing to say. I love it.

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:43):
How would you guess, Lenny? It's literally written on my face. Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:48):
Perfect. Last question. As the chief product officer at Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspell?

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:57):
The.

Lenny (01:08:00):
You do T-E-H?

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:01):
T-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny (01:08:04):
Oh, man. Well, I find I misspell every word.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:04):
Oh, that's funny.

Lenny (01:08:06):
I'm a terrible speller. I'm thankful for my... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:09):
I was about to say I have a product for you that can help with your spelling if you want.

Lenny (01:08:13):
I am an active Grammarly user. Not only that. I use every product you've worked on, I realize.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:17):
Oh, nice.

Lenny (01:08:17):
Obviously, Meta and mostly Instagram of the Meta products. And obviously Grammarly now and YouTube. I have a YouTube channel. Check it out. Subscribe and follow. And Thumbtack. My wife is a big Thumbtack user. We found many pros on Thumbtack from all kinds of parts of the world.

(01:08:35):
Noam, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:42):
Yeah. I'm pretty much @noaml everywhere online, so Twitter is probably the easiest. My DMs are open. And then how people can be useful to me is please use Grammarly, provide any feedback that you might have. And honestly, if I can be helpful in almost any way, feel free to reach out. I often will take those conversations and build those connections, and that is always very helpful for me as well.

Lenny (01:09:05):
No, thank you again so much for being here.

Noam Lovinsky (01:09:08):
Of course. Have a good one, Lenny.

Lenny (01:09:09):
Bye everyone.

Noam Lovinsky (01:09:10):
Bye.

# Picking sharp problems, increasing virality, and unique product frameworks | Oji Udezue (Typeform)

## Transcript

Oji Udezue (00:00:00):
Products who try to be viral just for what I call synthetic virality that fail. Because in the end, if you're synthetically viral and people get to the product and it sucks, that's it. Slack wasn't even viral, there was no synthetic virality. Slack couldn't even connect to organizations for the longest time. You could be working on the third floor, and someone using Slack on the fourth floor and you would have no clue, there's no way to share it with them. But what happens when you went to lunch? People are like, "We got Slack and this is amazing." And people on the third floor are like, "Holy shit, when can we get it?" Boom, boom, boom. This is the bedrock of virality. Build a great product that solves a sharp problem.

Lenny (00:00:37):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Oji Udezue. Oji has helped build and grow products at Microsoft. He worked on Windows, outlook, Hotmail and inner Explorer, at Atlassian where he was head of product for all their communication tools, at Calendly, where he was chief product officer, at Twitter where he was head of product for creation and conversation. He's currently chief product officer at Typeform, which I am a happy customer of. Oji has one of the broadest and most interesting careers in product, and he's also one of the most thoughtful humans I've met. In our conversation, Oji shares some of his favorite product frameworks and also why you should be really careful applying frameworks at your company. We dig into what he's learned from Calendly and Atlassian and a Typeform on how to do product led growth successfully, and also how to get really sharp with your ICP or ideal customer profile.

(00:01:31):
Also, how to increase your products virality and a concept called forest time, which I love. And even his favorite Nigerian food, which I am currently on the hunt for. With that, I bring you Oji Udezue after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:44):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

(00:03:01):
Oji, Thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Oji Udezue (00:03:12):
Thank you, Lenny. It's a pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:03:14):
It's my pleasure. You've been a PM and a product leader in so many amazing and also just very different companies, all with very different approaches to product and growth. And I think you have this very rare broad perspective on what works in product and growth across a lot of different ways of doing it. And so I have a bunch of questions for you. I hope you came ready for that.

Oji Udezue (00:03:34):
I am ready.

Lenny (00:03:35):
Okay.

Oji Udezue (00:03:36):
Yes, sir.

Lenny (00:03:37):
I love it. Okay, so I want to start with frameworks. You've written and shared a bunch of really interesting frameworks for how to think about product and growth, and so I just want to dig into a couple of them. And one of them is around how to find big B2B SaaS ideas and it's around finding the right workflow. Could you just share this framework and also just how founders and also investors can use this idea to find big ideas?

Oji Udezue (00:04:01):
Thank you. So I think you're referring to where do you fish to find a unicorn.

Lenny (00:04:05):
That's it.

Oji Udezue (00:04:06):
And the thing behind that is people can find that on Substack and the Medium, my writings. But the premise is that there's a lot of risk in building startups, and the last decade of product management and startups has really focused on the method of building software and companies. We talk about the lean approach, we talk about fail fast, [inaudible 00:04:28] and so on and so forth. And I think that that was a necessary phase for us because a lot of innovation was just the ideas of founders unvalidated by customers, and we needed this inflection point in our discipline. People need to understand though that customer science is not the solution to everything otherwise OpenAI will never have done anything. It's also innovation. And so the problem space and the solutions to the problems space is still a big driver of success in building software companies.

(00:05:03):
What problem are you really solving? And if you believe that the problem space is key, so what problems will predict success? In B2B SaaS especially, which is much easier to circumscribe is where I start to think about, look, how do you tell from the beginning? Because an investor as well as an operator. Now to segment this space, I think of two dimensions. One is how many departments in the company does the workflow you're trying to solve apply to? Is it just a few or is it all of them? And the second is how intense or how frequent is the workflow executed? Is it daily? Is it weekly? Is it three times a week? And so on and so forth. Now if you draw a nice quadrant of these two things, then you can start to have some predictive power. Things that are useful in every department I call every one workflows, like things like collaboration, like Slack, email, calendaring, workflows, social knowledge and Notion and so on and so forth.

(00:06:04):
And then things that apply to single departments, I call niche and that's what I call niche. And then the intensity is about frequency. A month is not infrequent, daily is super frequent. If you divide the market or the enterprise into frequency and into how broad the workflow is, you can actually have predictive power. And what I found by looking at the biggest company is public and private in each quadrant was that every one frequent workflows intuitively are the most profitable to work on, but also the hardest to get into because they're dominated by Microsoft and Google and very, very large companies. For example, one of my friends is the CEO of Coda. And so this is interesting, because he's in that space, for him to think about.

(00:06:58):
And then the place where B2B SaaS really thrives is niche workflows that are highly frequent. High ni is what I call it, high frequency niche. And then there are the other two quadrants that are a bit more challenging. And then you have to figure out how to navigate your way into one of the other two. If you are in one of the top two quadrants, high ni and high everyone and you solve a really important problem, workflow problem, you can probably turn into a billion-dollar company. If you do the other two, there's some challenges that you have to go through. And the framework talks about how you should navigate those places into success. And I think it's very important because if this is true, and by the way, like I said, I did some validation on it, founders can start to, before they invest years, start to think about what probability of success is. And if you're an investor like me or VC, you can start to think about how you deploy your money.

Lenny (00:07:57):
What are examples of companies in each of those quadrants? If you can frame this and I don't know if you have this in your head already.

Oji Udezue (00:08:03):
High frequency everyone workflows tend to be things that are done by the doorman to the CEO. So it's email, it's collaboration, it is writing, it is math, all the basic things. At Atlassian, we spend a lot of time thinking about this. So Word, we've had word processing forever in the workspace. Things like Notion and Confluence are huge as sort of evolution of that, Slack, email. Companies in that space, Google, Microsoft, Atlassian, et cetera. And the high ni, which is high frequency niche, you have things like Jira, you have things like tools for recruiters, you have martech, you have sales tech.

(00:08:49):
And we know the companies behind them, Atlassian, Salesforce, so on and so forth. And then in the low frequency everyone, you have things like maybe form tools. And actually, they're not that many of them, low frequency everyone or even expense. Actually, the best expensing. Not everyone does it all the time, but everyone essentially has to do some of it, mostly, at least a lot of people. And then there's a low frequency niche, which is particular department. So planning, which is done by FPNA, but done infrequently, things like that.

Lenny (00:09:30):
How frequent is frequent in your experience? Does it have to be once a week at least? What do you think is that minimum bar?

Oji Udezue (00:09:39):
Frequent is every day really or multiple times a week. Infrequent starts to be like two times a week, once a month. And of course there's a big interregnum in the middle of that.

Lenny (00:09:51):
It's interesting that there are examples of companies that succeeded in those lower quadrants of infrequent, say the expensing use case. Do you have a sense of what it takes to win there? Because I imagine most startups are in that area, and I imagine founders are like, what can we do to win still?

Oji Udezue (00:10:05):
Well, this isn't a static framework in the sense that companies are not destined to be one of these things. The essence of strategy is to navigate from the curve of travel is essentially go from the lower to the higher. Atlassian is trying to go from high niche to high everyone with Confluence and with all the tools that they have. People below are trying to get into the high frequency niche by focusing on their core customer. So what it looks like in say low frequency everyone workflows, something like that is, well, if some people are using it infrequently, but they must use it, well that's a good thing. But then maybe you provide a module that is used by the finance department every day, and so suddenly you're moving into the high frequency everyone workflow. So it's about finding a part of the organization that considers this mission-critical and then solving their problems beyond the problems for everyone for example, in that quadrant.

Lenny (00:11:08):
Is there an example that comes to mind of either at Calendly or Typeform or Atlassian where you pushed it further up the frequency direction or the everyone direction?

Oji Udezue (00:11:17):
For example, at Typeform, now this is real for me, Typeform technically is low frequency niche or low frequency everyone, depending on how easy it is to use and how it surrounds the customer. And one of the things that I'm trying to do as part of product strategy is to move it into high frequency niche, high ni, which is a very productive place to be. So for marketers, for salespeople, I want to make sure that they think of us first. And because we are particularly good at customer facing interactions, if they think that we are the way to win new business and to make money, then a portion of our audience, not every single one of them will consider us high ni. And I think expanding that foothold is the way to navigate a business like that. You can see that with Qualtrics, you can see that with SurveyMonkey. Lots of companies are thinking about how to further unbundle that market for a very, very specific kind of customer. And that is what they're trying to do. They're trying to hit the high ni, even for that more generic workflow.

Lenny (00:12:27):
That's an awesome example. You also have this framework that I think you call the zone of benefit, which is around how much better does your solution have to be than the status quo? A lot of people are like, "Hey, look at this product, it's better than what you have now." And usually people are like, "Ah, whatever. It's good enough." And you've had some insights on just how much better it needs to be for people to care. Can you share that?

Oji Udezue (00:12:45):
Honestly, the reason I like being a product manager is on any given day, I'm drawing from anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, leadership, communication skills. I'm trained, I have a master's in engineering, so I'm an engineer as well. I've done marketing and sales, so really pulling from so many things. And the reason I talk about the zone of benefit is ultimately what we're trying to do is impedance match technology to humans. That's it. If you really think about it, that's one essence of what we're trying to do. So the zone of benefit works as a framework because people will not pay for things that don't either really shrink the workflow that they're doing or doesn't give them superpower. So the same amount of time, but twice as much output. But the most important thing is that it has to be noticeable.

(00:13:39):
If you do something 20% better, often people just around you, just as a human, people don't notice. And so for a product to make a difference, it has to be at least two, three more X for people to say, "You know what? This is offering enough value for me to maybe make a switch in cost," and so on and so forth. And it really comes down to look, economic theory tells us that people work for leisure, they work enough to afford their leisure. It's sort of broad, and I know some people don't necessarily do that. Especially in the tech industry, people just love to work. But that is really it, when you think about eight billion people on the planet. And there's a lot of benefit really hones in on the fact that if you're going to help me work less, make about the same amount of money, then for me to notice you, you have to accelerate me by three times for me to care.

Lenny (00:14:36):
Okay, awesome. So three times. So the idea there is you should feel like this is three times more productive in the thing that I'm trying to do or saves me three times, I don't know, I do it three times faster.

Oji Udezue (00:14:44):
Yeah, that's when people actually feel it and they feel it enough where they part with money.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Awesome. And I think what's cool about this is it helps you identify the ICP for your product if you're working a startup or even a new product within an existing product to figure out who exactly is going to most benefit from this. Is that part of this?

Oji Udezue (00:15:02):
Yes, yes. Your best customers aren't price sensitive for what you're shooting for because they get it. They fundamentally understand it. So yes, when you're shooting for ICPs, now every startup has marketing problems getting an audience problem. But once you start getting a decent audience, over 100 people or more, you should start to notice the people who are like, "You know what? This, I really care about this." And that starts to tell you a little bit about who's your target audience.

Lenny (00:15:33):
Would you be up for sharing the ICP of some of the companies you worked at? Just to give people a sense of what would be a good ICP.

Oji Udezue (00:15:40):
I think for Atlassian, it's really kind of obvious. It's developers mostly. But it's tech teams writ large because the fundamental of an R and D team is building stuff. And Jira helps the engineers who actually build stuff to track what they do and to give visibility to it so that they can be valuable to the organization. So that is incontroversial. So the ICP is really clear and have been clear for Atlassian for a very long time. Calendly is this weird company where people don't see all the value. People think it's just casual scheduling. But really the people who care about scheduling the most, and I don't mean calendaring. Calendaring is very different from scheduling.

(00:16:25):
The people who care about scheduling the most are salespeople because it's the lifeblood of them earning money and marketers, because it's the lifeblood of them maybe learning about their customer. Recruiters, because it's the lifeblood of them attracting and scheduling the people that they need to do their job. So Calendly's ICPs were people who were scheduling with people who were not in the organization for some business reason. Typeform is marketers mostly because Typeform exists to make the web talkative, to make it more human. And with Typeform, you can brand that conversation and actually make it conversational because one question at a time, the beautiful design. And so marketers feel like we help their websites talk to each other. Product people think we help their web apps talk to people they care about, UX people feel the same way. So those are some, I think the interesting thing is Twitter.

Lenny (00:17:27):
I was going to ask what the ICP for Twitter might be, still.

Oji Udezue (00:17:33):
So Twitter is actually more fun in terms of ICP because first of all, I'll talk about the things that's not obvious about Twitter. 30% of Twitter's customer base were unseen, they were media organizations, people like the NFL, the NBA, HBO, who wanted their content to reach more people, to be in conversational spaces. And they were essentially business customers and not seen in the conversation pool, it's not obvious. But we interacted with them all the time and we rev shared ads for their videos, because we're making content all the time. And so Twitter was a way to extend the monetization of that content, that inventory that already had. But when you go to the consumer side of Twitter, who was the ICP?

(00:18:25):
Well, actually Twitter understood, and this is sort of reflected in what Elon Musk is doing these days, that he doesn't seem to understand. And if you ask anyone who was at Twitter, you'll see the understanding in their eyes and the fact that he doesn't understand, because Twitter's ICP is bifurcated. On one side, it is the most accomplished people in the world, the people who have something to say. This is why there's neuro Twitter, there's weather Twitter, there is cancer Twitter, and so on and so forth. In fact, if something breaks, some new innovation happens in the world, it probably breaks on Twitter before it breaks anywhere else, because these are people in informal communities following each other and sharing their results.

(00:19:10):
So basically there's this big circle of experts. We break down into celebrities, we break down into luminaries, leaders and so on and so forth. That's the ICP. Now how does Twitter work? These people attract the other 90% who listen to these people, but also they need to create their own informal communities around the things they're passionate about and have this mimetic relationship with the luminaries and the experts. And that is sort of the planet Twitter, experts on one side, humans who need to connect with the things they're passionate about, the people who are like them, that is the ICP of Twitter, the people who have something to say in those two categories.

Lenny (00:19:58):
Are you happy you're not working on Twitter anymore?

Oji Udezue (00:20:00):
I am ecstatic, I'm ecstatic. It seems like such a shitshow, no shade on anything or anyone purposely. But look, what's happening is evident. So I don't think I have much to say about that.

Lenny (00:20:18):
Yeah, what a wild ride over there. Zooming out on the frameworks question, when I asked you ahead of our chat about what frameworks you love and anything you think would be interesting to share, you had a really interesting response and so I'd love for you to just share your perspective on frameworks broadly.

Oji Udezue (00:20:34):
Yeah. Look, I'm two things simultaneously. One is actually, I like frameworks. The way that I try to express them is mental models because the essence of a framework and a mental model is that it is a shortcut. It packages some dense thinking into a way for you to approach a problem or to approach an opinion and so on and so forth. So I do collect them. But I think that what's important, I feel in product management, is to have the ability to understand the fundamentals or the empirical relationship that constructs a framework in the first place. In math, you would call it being able to derive the equation. And the reason that's important is because there's so much uncertainty in what we do. Product management isn't a science. In fact, programming isn't even a science really, because if it was, we'd treat it differently. So the art of building, say a software company that is profitable is not scientific.

(00:21:36):
There's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of unknowns, there's timing issues. So I guess while I love mental models, while I love frameworks, what I want people who listen to me and maybe listen to you to understand is you have to go deeper. Because as situations change, as an investor and advisor to startups, I advise differently if you are just starting, if you're in the middle, and if you're scaling. In the book that I'm writing on product, I actually make that distinction a lot in the book, which stage are you? Because then the thing that applies to you is different. If you understand the fundamentals, you'll be able to use frameworks in a much more productive way because you'll adapt it to your stage, you'll adapt it to the problem. And I think that's really important. I see lots of people using frameworks very blindly, and I think that's harmful to them and harmful to their businesses.

Lenny (00:22:31):
What a great segue to where I wanted to take us next, which is around the book that you're writing, which is my understanding is it's product management for product led growth. And I'm on your wait list to find out when it's out, and I saw that the other day you asked people for their advice on what to call the book. Do you have any favorites at this point of what you might title it?

Oji Udezue (00:22:50):
Well first of all, there are two things happening with the book. One is I believe PLG is, I have maybe a different definition of PLG, but I think the way that we are basically adapting products to the consumer or to the business professional and using the product itself to sell the value proposition is really key to transitioning from what we used to do 20 years ago to today. Basically, I think even enterprise companies will tend towards a consumer type product management over the next decade than the other way around, that's my bet. And so let's call that PLG, just writ large. And also I think product management is set for growth. So obviously that's good for you, Lenny, because everyone needs to know how to do this.

(00:23:39):
It's an integrative art within building software and software is seeding the world, the book, I want to get very practical. What matters about doing those two things well, and the best titles coming up are, my original title was Building Rocket Ships. So it's like how do you think through all the different things you need to build a really successful software company? Think about the practice, think about the business, meld those two things together. So a lot of people love that title. Well, there's a huge variation in submissions. So I think we're going to do that one more time and offer more options before we nail down the title of the book, so still TBD.

Lenny (00:24:22):
Cool, all right. I'm excited to see where you land. So let's just spend some time on PLG. I feel like this is your bread and butter as a product leader. You've worked at some of the most successful PLG companies and I think you have some of the most unique perspectives on what works and doesn't work. And I saw you shared a preview of what you're going to be sharing the book, and so there's a few things there that I thought were really interesting that I haven't seen other places when it comes to PLG. So I was just going to dig into it-

Oji Udezue (00:24:45):
Yay.

Lenny (00:24:49):
Absolutely. The first is this framing that you had for where to start and how to focus with your PLG problem. And you described it as starting with a sharp problem. Can you talk about what that means?

Oji Udezue (00:24:59):
Yeah, so I'm trying to connect dots. The sharp problem is a little bit of that whole quadrant framework, which is what problem are you going to work on? I think that problems have predictive power of success if you actually solve the problem. And this is different from, I have an idea, yeah. I think that a lot of innovation can come from inspiration, but the best inspiration comes from understanding customers and their problems. So my advice to founders is pick a problem that is materially felt by your customers, pain points that steal their time, their energy, their money, their focus, the inability to afford their leisure. If you can solve those kinds of problems, and look, I know that it's broad, because it requires insight. The best founders often are people who felt a problem, understand it, understand that it's really difficult, and understand that there may be like five, 10, 20 billion people who feel it and they don't want to solve that problem versus I feel a problem, but only 100,000 people care. In which case, maybe it's not that intense anyway, unless you can charge them thousands and thousands of dollars.

(00:26:22):
So pick those kinds of problems. If you have the narrative in your head that if you really solve this, people will pony up. That's what I ask people to find. Too many of us just have a sharp idea. Look, I've built a startup on a non-sharp problem, and I knew how it felt. Well, I also know working in companies that are solving sharp problems how it feels, it's a huge tailwind to do that. In fact, when you work on sharp problems, it's hard to fail because you can make mistakes and the customer's obsession will carry you, but if you work on something that doesn't have a sharp problem, mistakes can kill you because essentially you're having to pay a lot for marketing, you're having to pay a lot for word of mouth. People, when they get poor, they don't care about it, like recessions.

Lenny (00:27:15):
Coming back to something you mentioned earlier about just how much pain it needs to be for people to care or how much pain it needs to solve versus the status quo, I think is a really important element of this. I think most founders like, no, I need to solve a problem. But usually it's not painful enough or it's not solving it enough, given either an example of something that you've tried or you've seen of just like that was a sharpish problem but not sharp enough and people didn't care, either a company worked or a startup you advised of just like, okay, it wasn't sharp enough.

Oji Udezue (00:27:46):
I don't want to create enemies because I know a lot of founders. But here's one, here's one. I don't know if you remember during the pandemic, this venture studio by I think one of the ex founders of Evernote created mmhmm camera, remember that?

Lenny (00:28:04):
Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, great video.

Oji Udezue (00:28:07):
It was fun, but I don't think it was a sharp problem. It was fun, but yeah, it didn't change the world of your Zoom camera. It didn't change the world of your collaboration. And so I think that's one example of a non-sharp problem, for example, for most people.

Lenny (00:28:31):
What are signs that it's sharp enough, just like in your experience? I know you talked about it steals your time, energy, money focused. What are flags that this is sharp enough in your experience?

Oji Udezue (00:28:43):
I think there are two ways to think about it. If you are in the trenches as a founder, the easiest way to map out a sharp problem is draw the current approximate average workflow for your target customer, at least what you think is a target, and then draw the workflow after they've used your software and see how much shorter it is, yes or no. And then try to measure those lines. If you draw them as horizontal lines, try to measure those lines and see if it's much shorter. If it's 2X shorter, 3X shorter, so let's say pre-customer, that is the best way to hone in on it. Post customer, you should talk to the people who are most enthusiastic and derive their workflow and their workflow change and try to measure that. I think that's how you figure out if it's a sharp problem or not.

(00:29:37):
The other thing that we talk about in startup super early stage world is, I call it the whites of their eyes. When you take a problem and you share it with someone who it's going to affect their workflow, and I use the word workflow a ton because I don't use specs anymore or use cases, I think workflows are the unit of productivity. When you see people's eyes get big and they expose more whites to you, you're probably onto something. It's not enough, that's not a workflow thing, that's an excitement thing. But people often react that way when you're solving a really sharp problem for them. And then people spontaneously bring up money, it's like when can I pay? When can I... Those kinds of things give you an indication.

Lenny (00:30:23):
Two other versions of the showing more whites of your eyes, which I love. Two other versions of that I've heard is one is you see their pupils dilate and they're just like, "Whoa, I need this now." And then the other is someone described it as, you see this nod of as you're talking, they're just like, "Oh, I get it. I get this." And then they're like, "Okay, we need this in our company."

Oji Udezue (00:30:46):
I'm a little over those ones because sometimes it's just excitement and just noise. And so the things I said previously about workflow compression or capability inflation, I think those are more reliable, which is all about customer research and customer conversations. That's what I would focus on. Yeah, I'm saying all this from mistakes I've made, basically. So I feel like this is scar tissue, which is what I'm trying to pour into the book.

Lenny (00:31:18):
Speaking of talking to customers, another one of your big bullet points in the book is around continuous customer discovery, and I'm curious what you found to be successful in actually doing that. A lot of people talk about it when you keep talking to customers, get feedback constantly. What actually works in your experience?

Oji Udezue (00:31:34):
Yeah, I feel like all of park management is about discovery these days. Everyone talks about it, and I want to make a distinction. I think discovery is when you use customer conversations to understand a very specific thing that you want to optimize further workflow that you want to optimize further. And then you call the people who are most likely to be affected and you do use various research strategies to talk to them. There's a version of that also that is what I call continuous conversations, which is a Calendly and a Typeform, which we'll do more and more of. You should organize it so that your PMs, your designers, your engineering managers and your PMMs are constantly talking to customers by default. Meaning that customer conversations show up on their calendar every week automagically, without them getting involved. And then they're trained on how to have the conversation, because the death of customer discovery is friction. If you ask individuals to do customer discovery, they will not do customer discovery.

(00:32:49):
This is the thing that dies in an innovative company because it's very difficult to actually talk to the right customer, not talk to any customer, talk list of the right customer continuously. But there's a third thing that I like to talk about, which is customer listening. In fact, I'm going to talk about this at industry in October, the PM Conference. Customer listening is different. It's not really discovery. It is the scarfing up of customer signals that are happening constantly anyway. So people are talking on social, people are talking on app stores and G2 crowd. If you have a instrumented churn survey, people are talking. If you have NPS, people are not only giving you the scores where they're putting in the verbatims. If you have a bug report, which we had at Atlassian, people are filing bugs, developers love to file bugs, so of course we have that for that audience. And then if you go to Zendesk and customer support, people are either talking about one thing all the time or a range of things, and you can see the frequency distribution.

(00:34:01):
And of course in Salesforce, you have closed one. These are all things happening no matter what you do. Whether you're listening or not, you're getting these signals. One of the big, hairy, audacious goals of product management is being able to process these signals efficiently. We did it in a certain way at Calendly, which I drew a rig together through workflows and Slack, and then having individuals triage those things. And if you can do that hard and at industry, I'll talk a little bit about how to do it. It's not exactly discovery. It is what matters. Our job is to meld customer delight with business ambition. And it feels essential beyond discovery that you are listening and you're understanding what matters from a customer delight perspective. And I don't think many of us do this really well. I've tried to do it everywhere I've gone, Twitter, Atlassian, Calendly, now at Typeform. But it still feels like something that the industry can get better at.

Lenny (00:35:08):
This touches on advice that Teresa Torres teaches around continuous customer discovery. And she actually had a really good tactic, that I'll share here that stuck with me, about how to actually do this. So the way she recommends companies do this is have a little popup on your site asking visitors like we'd love to talk to you and get your feedback on our product. And it just links them to a Calendly to book a meeting, and that's how it shows up on the calendar.

Oji Udezue (00:35:30):
Yeah, that's what we did at Calendly. But I will say, so a couple of caveats, we did that in the community. We had community at calendly.com and we understood that that was a self-selected group. But it was still important to talk to them because they were still representative. And of course you should do it in a product. The challenge of that approach is always is it the right customer? And the pro/con of that is talking to one customer is useless, talking to 100 is super useful. And so the challenge is are you targeting the right person?

(00:36:09):
So some intelligence upfront and who to show it to and why you're showing it to them, so that they can come is interesting. Very particularly effective by the way for growth, because if people don't activate or churn, they don't want to talk to you. But if you can present that thing in their activation or conversion journey, they might actually talk to you. And so that's really key. So I 100% agree with Teresa, that's exactly what you should do for not even, I wouldn't even call it discoveries for listening, and some of it can be discovery. Yeah, I think that's exactly what you should do.

Lenny (00:36:45):
As you're talking I'm realizing I'm using most of the products you help build. I'm on Twitter a lot. I use Calendly a lot. I use Typeform as my default survey tool.

Oji Udezue (00:36:55):
I saw that, my team is really excited that you're using Typeform.

(00:38:32):
Getting back on track. Another important part of the book that you're writing is around onboarding. And something that I talk a lot about on this podcast is just the power of onboarding and how impactful it's to retention and so much of the eventual success of your product and how customers use it. And so I'd love to hear just your advice on what you think is really important, I guess why onboarding is so important in success and PLG. And also just what tactics have you found to be really effective?

Oji Udezue (00:38:59):
Let me talk about a few fundamentals. Onboarding is a substitute for sales and all these account management teams for millions of customers. The task is how do you make it approximate a human and how friendly a human is and how approachable a human is? Because if you can do that, then you can process thousands and thousands of customers very quickly. Onboarding is an exercise in understanding the mindset of a buyer, of an evaluator. It's nothing more than that. Meaning that the province of understanding is social psychology, it's not really product, it's biopsychology. And guess who knows a lot about this stuff, it's people in the offline industry. The people who stock shelves, the people who provide inventory online and so on and so forth. They are extraordinarily good at this. So the reason I say this is to divert people who are [inaudible 00:40:00] to really find where to source their inspiration from for onboarding, first of all.

(00:40:06):
If you think about this as intentful in that way, which is people come not knowing anything about you and in a progressively developed confidence that you are the tool of choice, you then have to break it down into how does that journey go through a mind, the average mind anyway, and how do you assist each part? One is value proposition, understanding, one is trying to see if it's simple enough and provides enough value. One is kicking tires and one is making the choice that this is something I'm going to go forward with. How does your onboarding support hit all of these things? Now I think there are two parts of onboarding. One is mandatory, the setup, it has to be spare. I try not to make it more than three screens, but it's about how do you say what this does and provide the essential setup that your customer needs to be successful?

(00:41:05):
At Calendly, for example, we asked them about connecting their calendar and setting some defaults. Is it 9:00 to 5:00 or whatever that is? Those two things set up all the future success. And if we made it optional, more people would fail. So it's information and the essential setup, and it should be as short as possible. Then there's a whole other set of things that should be optional because they're not necessary for everyone to be successful, but they're beneficial if people are curious. And also, it can be what we call a random access, so people can get back to it any time they want, if they're feeling help. And so if you divide onboarding into those two things and then figure out what to put in one and what to put in the other, I think you can be quite successful. And this is just the tip of the iceberg that I get into in the book.

Lenny (00:41:56):
Are there any examples of really big onboarding wins, things that really helped with conversion or activation that come to mind?

Oji Udezue (00:42:01):
Well, I think keep it short is one big win. The fewer things, the better, that are essential, that everyone has to go through. It's unclear if all those clickthroughs go here, go here, and all those things work-

Lenny (00:42:16):
The wizards, yeah.

Oji Udezue (00:42:18):
Yeah. The wizards have had, in my experience, limited benefit. So much as just directing people to the one thing that they need to do post mandatory onboarding. Having examples, not 10, one or two of what good looks like is particularly powerful because it's mimetic. People see, oh, okay, this is exactly what I'm shooting for, is very powerful. In terms of trial and conversion, letting people understand and being very clear about where they are in the trial cycle, whether you want them to pay for it now or they need to pay for it later, after seven days. Having them understand that really clearly so they know where they are versus they feel like they're completely at sea, I think is very important for conversion.

(00:43:07):
I think there are a few things like that, but I also want to mention that it's different for every product. Depending on where you are in the quadrant and the amount of augmentation and problem solving and how sharp the problem is, you might want to adjust your approach. And this is the kind of thing that there's some fundamentals, but it's not necessarily this one size fits all. In fact, at Typeform, we're trying to maybe invent a new twist on freemium just because of some of the things we're seeing for our particular customers. And so yeah, these are for me, some new learning as well as I go through each different product.

Lenny (00:43:49):
Along these lines of onboarding activation and getting a user activated is really important. And I'm curious, do you have an example of what an activation milestone was at Calendly or Twitter or a Typeform? Just to give people a sense of like here's a good example of an activated user milestone.

Oji Udezue (00:44:03):
I think this goes back to people, the Pendos and the Amplitudes of this world. You have to think through your aha journey. Like at Calendly and also at Typeform we have three thresholds of increasing activation. And we just try to make sure that people go through each one as many people as possible. And frankly, we try to figure the drop-off between the increasing definitions of activation. So at Calendly we want to make sure you've created your first meeting. But then if you've created five within a week, that's really much more powerful. At Typeform, it's really about have you published the form and have you gotten responses? And have you gone to look at what the responses mean in the insights page, for example.

(00:44:52):
At Twitter it is are you following anyone or are you being followed? Because that verb, follow, is the way you start to construct your informal community. Remember what I said is Twitter is for people who want informal community around a topic that is not... Facebook is about who do you know, Twitter is about who do you want to know? Who's passionate about what you're passionate about? And so if you haven't set up your follow graph at all, you're not going to really activate. It's not going to be compelling for you.

Lenny (00:45:23):
Awesome, those are great examples. It's funny hearing that Twitter activation milestone out of context sounds, so creepy. Have you followed anyone or is anyone following you?

Oji Udezue (00:45:31):
Yeah, because a lot of people go in and then they tweet into the void or they don't feel like they have a voice. But that's not the most important thing. Most important thing is are you getting content that you are interested in that makes you want to come back and see more of it and follow is a huge part of doing that.

Lenny (00:45:47):
Yeah. Just on the point of Twitter, I don't know if this goes anywhere, but it's crazy how it keeps going no matter how much destruction is happening all around, employees-

Oji Udezue (00:45:58):
Oh, you want me to talk about that? Because I want to talk about this.

Lenny (00:45:58):
Please, let's do it.

Oji Udezue (00:46:04):
So one of the things they, I don't want to say they, one of the things I learned early on is network effects.

Lenny (00:46:11):
Yeah.

Oji Udezue (00:46:12):
Network effects, let me define it. Network effects is when you create value for passive members by other people joining the network. So I am by myself, I have done nothing. I'm at home, chilling, but one person joins the network and immediately I gain benefit, okay. So think about Facebook. If there are eight billion people on Facebook, it means that all of a sudden I can reach everyone on the planet. And so the more people on Facebook, the more it's valuable to me regardless of my effort. That's network effect. If I'm into Word, word processor, Microsoft Word, and the more people who use that file format, it means that the more Word documents I can read.

(00:47:05):
And so I did nothing, so by increasing the people adoption of Word, I gain benefit. Network effect, that's what it is. So Twitter and then this is the mental model of critical mass, network effect is about critical mass. You hit a critical mass and sometimes that's not mathematically defined, and then you've hit network effect because people want to come because people are already there. So Twitter has hit critical mass and lots of your favorite social networks. Network effects is a feature by itself, and it's the most powerful feature. A good way to illustrate the power of network effects is Twitter did not die because Threads came about, that's the power of network effect. In fact, the last telegram was sent in 2016, over 100 years after it was invented because of network effects. It had to be manually closed down.

(00:48:03):
I believe Friendster is still alive, so we have to be really clear that it's really hard to kill a network effects business. Now how do you actually accomplish it if you were to accomplish it? Well, the revenue side of any social network is vulnerable to attack. So for example, if advertisers stop being on Twitter, for example, they're not gone because again, network effects affects them. They want to go where the eyeballs are. But if for some reason they disappeared, while the people will continue to come, the ability to have money to improve the network will disappear. And that is a negative spiral. What is very, very hard to kill business, it's hard to kill software that's reached network effect, although you can kill businesses that have reached network effect.

Lenny (00:48:56):
That's a really important and interesting insight. I think what's even especially interesting about Twitter is Elon and the team have removed every other benefit of Twitter, like the brand, gone, employees, 80% gone. Every part of it is being cut off, except for the network effects, and so it's a really cool case study. Dan Hockenmaier tweeted this, was a previous guest, of just like it's a good case study of what is just the power of just network effects.

Oji Udezue (00:49:19):
That's right. I did a really interesting course at Berkeley Business School, asked about technology companies and so on, and this is a perfect case study on network effect. The best I've ever seen. It is incredible.

Lenny (00:49:36):
Yeah, it's wild Threads isn't able to get there quickly, unlike what it felt like initially.

Oji Udezue (00:49:43):
Threads will prosper, I believe. And again, it'll just be another click for advertisers who understand the Facebook marketplace versus Twitter ad marketplace is much harder to access. And so I think the way Threads wins is the revenue spiral versus the pure activity spiral.

Lenny (00:50:02):
Interesting. Where essentially they find ways to, even with lower base, generate revenue, which drives advertisers, drives more investment.

Oji Udezue (00:50:10):
Correct, correct, correct.

Lenny (00:50:11):
Awesome. All right. That'll be fun story to watch. Kind of along those same lines, I want to chat about virality a little bit. You worked on some of those viral products out there in B2C, I guess Twitter is an example, but also in B2B, which is really rare and interesting. And I know there's no silver bullet for increasing virality, but everyone's always wondering, how do I increase the virality of my product? So I'm curious, anything you could share, any tactics that you've seen work to increase the virality, especially of a B2B product?

Oji Udezue (00:50:36):
Well, as is my style, I want people to understand what virality is in the first place because I think people have misconceptions about it. People think virality is some Hotmails tag at the bottom that says, we'll get a free account. Virality is really when the word of mouth of a product is high quality. That's really the essence of it. Let me rephrase that. It's when customers market your product. And that is incredibly powerful, but also that's incredibly actionable, if that makes sense. There are products who try to be viral just for what I call synthetic virality that fail. Because in the end, if you're synthetically viral and people get to the product and it sucks, that's it. That's the end. Even Hotmail, for example, people talk about the viral tag. I don't know, you know what I'm talking about? Because I-

Lenny (00:51:32):
Absolutely, at the bottom, yes [inaudible 00:51:34].

Oji Udezue (00:51:35):
Well remember, it wasn't just that. It was one of the first webmail things. And webmail was revolutionary because you didn't have to have a POP3 client and lose your email across multiple devices. It solved a lot of really good problems for customers at the time for email. And so when they arrived from the free account, it was like, holy crap, this is amazing. And so let's do that. Uber doesn't have any weird viral traps, but it compresses the workflow of getting a cab so much that it's viral, if that makes sense. In fact, it was this time where Austin kicked them out for and other apps came in and filled the void, and then it came back after the year and just crushed everybody. There was no campaign, it was just viral by itself. So that's what virality is. So then the question is how do you increase it?

(00:52:30):
Well look, fundamentally build a great product that solves a sharp problem and build it really well. If you do this, this is the bedrock of virality. If you don't do this, there's no viral tactic that will work in a sustained way. It will fizzle. But if you do this, you can lay on synthetic virality strategies for referral, strategies for coming back into the app and creating an account. Remember before Calendly, there was Acuity scheduling, there was other things. The difference was Calendly was so well-made, so simple for schedulers, so respectful of schedulers' time, not just the creator's time that the virality worked. It did not work for others who sucked. Xted AI and other places, they weren't that good. You have to be good to be viral.

Lenny (00:53:33):
That is such an important insight, that everyone looks at Calendly like of course you're sharing calendars with everyone, it's going to go viral. That's like what a cool trick. But your point is so interesting that there's previous versions of that, but the product itself wasn't great. The experience wasn't great. It was too complicated, it didn't work, and that's what made it so viral.

Oji Udezue (00:53:52):
Yeah, there may be several things I think affect virality. But I think that this is the nugget that people need to take away, that is the foundation of bedrock of all of them. Customer support actually affects virality. If you have fanatical customer support, people will love it. Viral tactics like the page that says, oh, get an account, and so on. All these signing documents, Calendly and so on and so forth. Network effects as in Calendly, you have these green dots. If you and a person have, Calendly tells you when you're free, all network effects, really high quality execution, synthetic virality all contribute to net virality. But the fundamental is exactly what we just discussed.

Lenny (00:54:38):
Just got to get it all right. No big deal.

Oji Udezue (00:54:42):
Build the best product possible, honestly, if you want to be viral. Slack wasn't even viral, there was no synthetic virality. Slack couldn't even connect to organizations for the longest time. Why? You could be working on the third floor and so on, using Slack on the fourth floor, and you would have no clue. There's no way to share it with them. But what happens when you went to lunch? People are like, "We got Slack and this is amazing." And people on the third floor are like, "Holy shit, when can we get it?" Boom, boom, boom. Great product first is virality.

Lenny (00:55:14):
Seth Godin has this phrase they always come back to, if you want to make your product remarkable, something people want to remark about, and that's basically the core of word of mouth.

Oji Udezue (00:55:23):
Yes, yes, yes.

Lenny (00:55:24):
I was watching a talk you did on this kind of topic and you had this great phrase that you sort of touched on, but I think it's so good, and I just want to make sure we highlight it, which is that virality is customer augmented marketing.

Oji Udezue (00:55:36):
Yeah, I think it is the thing that I started with first. It's when your marketing is essentially done by your customers because what it does, it affords you the ability to spend less on marketing. And you can either uplevel your marketing execution or save money that you can put in the product. Atlassian spends maybe like 10, 20 percentage points less on marketing than the equivalent competitors because it's viral and also because it's network effects at this point as well, say Jira. And so it's customer augmented marketing. Your customers are either forcing other people to adopt it or shaming them into adopting it or FOMOing them into adopting it. So yes, virality is essentially customer oriented marketing, which gives you options.

Lenny (00:56:28):
I love that phrase, I'm going to use it now. I have just a few more questions before we get to a very exciting lightning round, and these are kind of random two topics that I wanted to chat on. One is this concept that you call forest time. It's a post you wrote about the importance of forest time. Can you just describe what that is and why it's so important, and then also just how to do this?

Oji Udezue (00:56:49):
I operate, I'm an operator right now, meaning that I'm building things, I work for a company. But I also advise and invest, which is different. When I'm advising, I'm looking from above, from outside, I have a bird's eye view and I'm able to say, "You know what? This will work. This won't work. What have you done? Can I look at the results?" And then cycle the advice based on what you're seeing and what I'm seeing. When I'm operating, I'm building a team, I'm hiring, I'm managing all the things, Alina, shout out that hates sometimes. And that's what I'm doing. When you are operating, you have the tug of war. It is so intense that you don't have the attention to have a bird's eye view constantly.

(00:57:39):
And so forest time is the idea that you make time within your week, within your month to see the forest for the trees. Most of the time when you're operating, you're seeing the tree, which is the problem in front of you. But sometimes you need to see the forest, so you can figure out it as an alternate path, different from the one that you are currently on your campaign. And so it's time to elevate, to get some bird's eye view, to see the entire landscape and see the alternative paths through the current problems that you're escaping. And I think that it has to be very intentional. And intentionality there is, I have published a workflow, a document that helps you make that step to make that elevation.

(00:58:25):
Like what are the issues? What are alternative ways to solve this potentially that I'm not seeing? Et cetera. And what I try to do is I try to create that forest time for my executive team as well because it's not just me that suffers from this, it's most everybody. In fact, it's most PMs because PMs are so influential that the spoke of the wheel of product creation and product development that we often, it's a sine wave. You are discovering and shaping problems and then you are commanding and captaining execution. And it's endless and they're endless meetings. And so you need to create time for forest time, for elevation. If you don't, you'll become less effective over time. It's just attrition.

Lenny (00:59:14):
And then just to make it even more concrete for people, what are examples of forest time? Is it taking time off? Is it advising on the side? Is it-

Oji Udezue (00:59:20):
It is taking a day off at the end of a month, a full day or two days. And instead of just playing golf, although that's fine, it is doing a workflow, worksheet to survey the forest specifically. And sometimes managers are like, "Wait, you're giving people a day off when they should be working harder and harder?" And I think it's completely worth it. It's not about working harder, it's working smarter. It's about seeing more options than you see. And so I'm very happy to give that time to product managers, to product executives or design executives or engineering executives.

(01:00:01):
Because I think that if they do it properly, then we'll have better execution in the long run. Let's put it this way, in product development, we aim for maybe like 10% of the time and then we execute and build for the other side. It's not just, there's more stuff we do. If your aim is off, then you are spending one, $2 million incorrectly of people's time. And so forest time should improve your aim. That's the entire point, because your aim is a precursor to a huge amount of investment. And so I think it's well worth it.

Lenny (01:00:36):
I love this. So specifically what you do with your team is once a month, you give them a day to do this kind of worksheet that you put together?

Oji Udezue (01:00:45):
Yes.

Lenny (01:00:45):
And then that worksheet is in this post that you wrote, that you point to. Is that right?

Oji Udezue (01:00:49):
Correct, correct.

Lenny (01:00:50):
Amazing. Okay, great. This is very practical advice. I love it. Okay, one last question before a very exciting lightning round. You worked at Bridgewater Associates, which I didn't know until I started digging into your past. That sounds creepy. And Bridgewater Associates famous for what? Ray Dalio's hedge fund, author of Principals and all these other incredible books, and it's a very unique working environment. So I just wanted to ask about your experience there, specifically one of the craziest things there is just this thing called dots I think it's called, where people just call out mistakes that people make at the company and it's public. Is that how it actually was? Any memories of that?

Oji Udezue (01:01:27):
Yeah, yeah. I was a senior management, what's called an SMA, which is the management layer right under Ray's team. And we were the priests of the Church of Bridgewater. Bridgewater did things like record, this is public knowledge, I'm not saying anything-

Lenny (01:01:50):
Yeah, he writes about-

Oji Udezue (01:01:51):
... before every meeting. Eventually we created a dot collector, which allows you to rate people in real time. So I'm just having a conversation with you and before the meeting closes, in front of each other, I pull up my laptop and I rate you and rate the interaction. And in theory, the idea is that if you constantly rate people across hundreds of interactions, then you build a picture of them that is fairly accurate, statistically accurate, that will transcend maybe emotional relationship as wisdom of the crowd idea. So that's a theory. In practice, it is emotionally exhausting. And like you said, the little creepy, even the recording.

(01:02:38):
So I think there were things about Bridgewater that I understood intellectually in terms of the purpose that Ray had designed, but didn't quite work. It's like the way I think about this is the theory of the principles are really good. The practice and the execution can be quite off and not very human or not very empathetic. But I will say this, Bridgewater taught me things that I don't think any other organization in the world thought taught me. One example is Bridgewater thinks of people in three dimensions, their skills, their attributes, and their values. Most organizations think about people in terms of just their skills. But it makes sense that people have attributes and values, that people are timid, people are bold, people like to jump in, people like to stand back.

(01:03:38):
All these other things, we think about personality and proclivity. Bridgewater tries to establish and measure them and also tries to write job descriptions that say, this is the kind of attributes we're looking for, not just the skills we're looking for. And then of course values. Are you a thief or are you a principled? And so on and so forth. Now that idea of looking at talent or people in general, both in your professional life and in your personal life, is a huge addition to me as a professional from Bridgewater. So I'm saying that there were things I didn't enjoy about Bridgewater, but things that I learned that I've learned nowhere else as well.

Lenny (01:04:18):
Did you take that to what you do today? Thinking of people in those three different ways and-

Oji Udezue (01:04:23):
100%. in my professional life, in my personal life, when I interview people, I am cognizant of those three things and I try to extract those three things, because I think it improves your success. Famously, all the weird skill-based interviewing at Google was only 50/50 predictive. And the reason is Google did not consider the other two things, I believe. Bridgewater was willing to endure 80% attrition to arrive at the best people. Now I don't think it works for them because some of their system was not empathetic of humans, like expecting humans to be computers. But I thought that was a very important insight.

Lenny (01:05:08):
Awesome. Oji, is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Oji Udezue (01:05:14):
In the history of product development, we have basically started to create abstraction to guide our work versus the Wild, Wild West. So the engineers came up with agile and peer programming and all these things. The designers have come up with design thinking, design sprints, and combined with research to talk about how to do discovery of various complexity. And the question is the product abstractions, because there's code, there's product in this business. So the product and business layer, what is our abstraction? What is our crucible for organizing our work?

(01:05:52):
We don't even have one. We don't have a name for it. And so the idea of a part system is that there's an abstraction above agile and design thinking that we have to pay attention to build solid organizations and to execute well at the product and the business layer. This is a co-creative framework with me and Ezinne. And the idea here is how do you construct a good product system? And literally, you could boil it down into a checklist of the systems you need to build a really good cohesive R and D organization. So I think that's the tee up. I'm going to have to leave you thirsty because someone else is probably going to go deep into it.

Lenny (01:06:35):
Amazing. And that's your wife that you mentioned who you are co-creating this framework with and who we're going to have on the podcast in the future.

Oji Udezue (01:06:40):
That's right.

Lenny (01:06:41):
What is it like being married to another product leader? Would you recommend?

Oji Udezue (01:06:45):
100%, you can have really productive conversations and you can redesign other company's applications in one conversation in the evening.

Lenny (01:06:57):
Amazing. Well, that was almost the lightning round question, but I moved it up earlier. And so with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Oji Udezue (01:07:06):
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:07:07):
Okay, great. Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Oji Udezue (01:07:13):
There's one business book that I recommend, I think it's called The Halo Effect. It's basically a book that lets you call on all these business books that tell you all kinds of stupid shit. It is how to deconstruct what is important in a business and self-help book and what is not important and what is just circumstantial storytelling with random facts and form-fitting evidence. It's called The Halo Effect. Read it. Why do you need to read it? Because garbage in, garbage Out.

(01:07:45):
People were amazed at the Outlier Effect, Malcolm Gladwell, and then people have been tearing it down for 15 years now. But everyone ingested it and thought it was the most important thing. But how do you know what's important to take away from them and what's not? The Halo Effect will help you. And then the other thing is, I read for pleasure because I read a lot for work. And so science fiction is the thing. There's lots to recommend, but I would say that people should either read Dune, Frank Herbert or Foundation by Asimov. If you haven't read those two things and you're a science fiction person, you really should. The world building is incredible. I understand Tolkien and fantasy, but the science fiction side of it is those two books.

Lenny (01:08:32):
There's also a TV series of Foundation now, which I can say recommend absolutely. But it's a beautiful show.

Oji Udezue (01:08:39):
Yeah, no. I haven't watched Foundation yet. I just felt super weird watching it after reading it. And I could only make it through three quarters of Dune. Well one, but I will make it through them. I don't expect them... The books are glorious. If you love prose, the books are, man, crazy. But I will get through them eventually.

Lenny (01:09:04):
I've not actually read Dune, but the movie was incredible. I played the video game Dune where you're just mining spice all day and it's just stuck in my brain forever. Okay, next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Oji Udezue (01:09:18):
I try to ask two. I feel like it's going to give people a cheat sheet when I interview them. But I try to ask two questions. So I'm not a person who does favorites, so it's hard for me to pick favorites. But I ask people to introduce themselves and I think it tells me a lot about them, how they tell about themselves, what they say about themselves and the content of it. I ask people about the things they think they're truly great at and then I ask people the things they think they need to learn. The latter too is about their professional skill, their craft. I think it tells me a lot about how they communicate, it tells me a lot about how thoughtful they are. It tells me a lot about what they're proud of and what they lead into. And those kinds of things are very important to me.

Lenny (01:10:10):
What is a favorite product you recently discovered that you love?

Oji Udezue (01:10:13):
I have been optimizing my workspace a lot. So I'm on a kick right now where I use Windows. I was in the Windows PM and I still have my Windows box. But a lot of people, we use Mac at work and I've used Mac for the last few years. So even though I switched between them, I've spent a lot more time on Mac and my Windows experience is completely optimized. It is perfect. But Mac, I'm like the Windowing sucks, there's all these gaps I see. So I've been trying to figure out how to dial in my Mac experience.

(01:10:49):
I hate the activity monitor, sucks. What's a replacement? The sound. It doesn't support sound through HDMI or sound through... I don't know, just some weird setup. So I've been optimizing that. One particular product that I like in the context of that is Unlocks. It's one man product that allows me to just look at my phone and log into my Mac when I walk up and then locks it when I walk away. And it'll actually detect my proximity. So it'll start the login process while I get close. I think that's incredible and I feel like it improves my productivity.

Lenny (01:11:26):
Very cool. Sounds like a lot of haterade for Macs over here.

Oji Udezue (01:11:30):
Well, for someone who uses it a lot, no, I think pros and cons. I'm no longer paid by Microsoft, so there are things I don't like. But there are also things that the Mac isn't perfect either.

Lenny (01:11:42):
Yeah, indeed. What is a favorite life motto that you repeat to yourself or share with other people, either in work or in life that you find valuable?

Oji Udezue (01:11:52):
I've taken to saying that there's more knowledge outside my head than inside it. And this is a plea for curiosity. I have three main things that are my North Star personally. Obviously when I say personally, I mean everything professionally. Which is originality, curiosity, and wisdom. And so this thing about there's more knowledge outside my head than inside my head is a plea for curiosity, it's a plea for skepticism. It's a plea to be humble about what you know, no matter how old you are, about the world around you, and always be listening for more. Even when you know something, let other people speak because they might add 10% more to the 90% you know. And so being an active listener is very important.

Lenny (01:12:48):
Beautiful. Last question, you are from Nigeria. What is a Nigerian food that you think people need to find and get ASAP?

Oji Udezue (01:12:57):
I'll recommend two, depending on how familiar you are. So if you've never had fried plantain with beef stew-

Lenny (01:13:06):
Oh man, that sounds great.

Oji Udezue (01:13:08):
... then you should stop what you're doing, stop work, whatever you're doing, find your next Nigerian friend and go get some, okay? This is the food that most Nigerians will basically trade years of life to have access to, okay. So that's what I would say. And then the second thing is if you want to be in the in club in Nija, as we call it, you got to try pepper soup.

Lenny (01:13:48):
Pepper soup.

Oji Udezue (01:13:48):
Now, if you all are not into spicy stuff, I'm sorry, the door is close to you. But pepper soup is really... And it is amazing. It'll make you sweat, but it's delicious and you should give it a shot.

Lenny (01:14:05):
Oji, I think we've solved many people's sharp problems. I really appreciate you making time being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Oji Udezue (01:14:16):
I publish on Substack when I have time, you should check it out. It's usually all about things that are beneath the surface. What's behind the thing. I believe that's how you'll find it. I'm on Twitter as well, so you can follow me because I will talk about products. How you can be useful to me is go follow me on Twitter, sign up for updates on the book. If you do, I will draw from that audience to help name the book, to help design the cover for the book. The book is intended to have a freemium because I want this book to be available to people in Africa and India, across the world. So there'll be a free version of it and there'll be premium versions with more tools, more help, and maybe even interviews with luminaries that you care and love as well. And so hopefully that will fund the free side of it as well. So come in, become part of the party, maybe join a pre-read, an early draft read. That is the best way you can help. So this is a call to all PMs and people of goodwill.

Lenny (01:15:29):
Amazing. What a great answer to that question. I'm going to go get some pepper soup and some plantain beef meals. Thank you so much for being here, and I'm going to go get some food.

Oji Udezue (01:15:41):
All right. Thank you, Lenny. It was super enjoyable and love hanging out and God speed.

Lenny (01:15:48):
Bye, everyone.

# How to ask the right questions, project confidence, and win over skeptics | Paige Costello (Asana)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
You're often the youngest person in the room. What have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics?

Paige Costello (00:00:07):
The thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product.

Lenny (00:00:15):
I'm curious, what you find most holds back new PMs?

Paige Costello (00:00:19):
Your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. Effectively, there's this notion of, "How might the opposite be true?" The moment I challenged myself and said, "How might the opposite be true?" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine."

Lenny (00:00:45):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Paige Costello. Paige is a product lead at Asana overseeing teams responsible for the core product experience of Asana. Before Asana, she was Director of Product at Intercom, and prior to that, she was a group product manager at Intuit where she spent five and a half years. In our wide-ranging conversation, we dig into strategies for building trust with people who are more experienced than you or older than you, we talk about coaching product managers, including why leading by example is often the most effective strategy, we talk about Asana's product development process and how it's evolved over the years as the company has scaled, plus some of Paige's product and career missteps, and what she's learned from those moments. To prep for this interview, I got input from some of Paige's colleagues and former colleagues, and everyone I talked to loved Paige. You'll soon see why. Enjoy this episode with Paige Costello after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:47):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.

(00:02:29):
If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:03:04):

(00:04:05):
Paige, welcome to the podcast.

Paige Costello (00:04:07):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:08):
So you don't know this, and I've been telling you this, but I asked a bunch of people that you worked with and maybe currently work with for questions, suggestions of things to ask you. So this is going to be really fun.

Paige Costello (00:04:19):
Wonderful. Now, I want to know who you talked to, but we'll find out.

Lenny (00:04:23):
I'll tell you right now. Big thank you to Jackie Bavaro, Yasmin who's on your team, and Montgomery and Steve Morin who is currently at Asana.

Paige Costello (00:04:32):
Ooh, fun.

Lenny (00:04:33):
So thank you to all of those folks for giving me a bunch of great questions, suggestions.

Paige Costello (00:04:37):
Looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:04:38):
Maybe just to settle a context, can you just talk about... At Asana, what do you work with? What is your team? What do you work on, and what is your team responsible for broadly?

Paige Costello (00:04:45):
Yeah. Absolutely. So I lead the product organization that's responsible for our desktop, web, and mobile apps at Asana. The teams are composed of all the people in San Francisco and New York who are focused on creating clarity for individuals, teams, and organizations. Effectively, our goal is to help teams work together more efficiently and drive the outcomes they're going for. So you can think about the feature sets if you're an Asana user like goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, reporting, all of that. But really, we want to help people answer the question at work, "Who is doing what by when, and why?" So that notion of clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, progress, and responsibility are often so painful in people's work lives. When there is certainty there and clarity there, people can be much more efficient in getting the work done. So that's where my focus is every day. I'm a product leader for that group.

Lenny (00:05:44):
Cool. So, basically, like the core. When people think of Asana, it's all of that stuff is what it sounds like.

Paige Costello (00:05:49):
Yeah, yeah. There's another group that's focused on our process management, but a lot of the core work in project management, core is in my group, and then we have a growth and enterprise scale team.

Lenny (00:06:01):
You've been at Asana for about four years now, right?

Paige Costello (00:06:03):
Yes, four years this summer.

Lenny (00:06:04):
Cool. So something I'm always curious about companies that are at this scale is just the evolution they've gone through in terms of how they develop product, and so I'm curious, just in the time you've been there, how has the product development process at Asana changed, and maybe even simpler, what are some of the bigger changes that have been made to the way product is built at Asana over the years?

Paige Costello (00:06:26):
I would talk a little bit about how we set strategy and our planning process, and how that's changed in this time as well as how we actually ship product has changed in this time. On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams.

Lenny (00:07:23):
It might actually help if you even describe what is a pillar, what is an area in product development.

Paige Costello (00:07:27):
Yeah. Absolutely. So when I said I'm responsible for that core product pillar, that's one pillar, but then there's also the adoption and enterprise scale pillar and the workflow pillar. Within each of those, there are subgroups, and we call those areas. Each of those areas has a very specific target customer and problem space they're solving for. We've often also dialed up the clarity of the metric at that level. So while we have an R&D set of metrics, we have pillar metrics, we have area metrics, and then at the team level, there's often one or two that they're really driving forward. So you can think of it as a nested structure around our product strategy as well as how we measure success.

(00:08:14):
When I joined, we didn't have areas. We were organized around projects and around locations, and then we worked to make sure that the thinking was more durable and problem-focused so that our roadmaps were not about features, but were instead about what was most meaningful to tackle for our business growth. So that's a big thing that has changed is the altitude of planning and how that nests. Another thing that has changed is the time horizon. So, before, we planned annually primarily. Now, we plan every six months, but for a rolling 12 months. So we have higher confidence in the immediate half, lower confidence in the following half, but we just plan every 12 months, every six months because it gives our business more confidence in what's coming and a better opportunity to align our go-to-market and product planning.

Lenny (00:09:10):
Amazing. So I just actually was talking to one of the heads of product at Shopify, and they went through a similar transition where they used to plan yearly, and now they plan for the next six months. So it's interesting that I'm hearing this more and more, and you're saying that every six months, you revisit the plan for the next year. So it's an interesting hybrid of those two.

Paige Costello (00:09:30):
Yeah. Absolutely. I think the more you try to do things in a joined up way where you have a single target customer with sales and marketing, and you want to make sure that the impact of your releases hit their mark, the more it's important to reflect on it frequently and to be able to pivot quickly because our strategy, even when we think we have a two-year vision, something will change, and then we say, "Wow, we made so much faster progress on this than we thought, and we actually believe that there's a new opportunity or a new technology that we should be leveraging. Let's go bigger on that." So it reduces the feeling of churn and thrash. It makes us all more principled, and it helps us just make sure we're making the best use of our teams.

Lenny (00:10:20):
I like that it also admits you're not going to actually have a yearly plan, like everyone plans for year, and then halfway through, they're like, "No. Let's start rethinking everything again."

Paige Costello (00:10:30):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:10:30):
So I like that you're upfront about that.

Paige Costello (00:10:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:31):
Okay, and then within the plan, do you have quarterly plans and sprints? Is there anything more fine-grained with a detailed roadmap just while we're on the topic?

Paige Costello (00:10:38):
Yeah, not really. I mean, teams know approximately when are they expecting to do the work, but if you ask too much for a particular quarter, a particular week, or date, you will make strange choices about scope. So, really, we align on what success looks like, and the teams do their best job to ship as quickly as possibly, as iteratively as possibly, and we really encourage prototyping. So we added into our product process a notion that we might pivot or cut from stuff that we put on our roadmap because it felt like once it was on the roadmap, it had to be done, and that's just not smart.

Lenny (00:11:20):
Got it. So, essentially, there's a six-month roughly detailed plan of what each team is going to work on?

Paige Costello (00:11:25):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:11:25):
Got it. Interesting.

Paige Costello (00:11:26):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:26):
Maybe just a couple more things just to make them super concrete for folks that might be listening. What's an example of an area? What's an actual team that would be an area? Then, the other question I have just while I'm saying questions is, are there some metrics you could share of just what some of these teams might be gold on just as examples of how you think about metrics?

Paige Costello (00:11:45):
The area that came to mind when you asked about one of our areas is something called Coordinate, and their job is effectively making sure that the slice of Asana that helps teams work together is working effectively. So that's projects, and tasks, and the data that you might put into tasks, and all of the back and forth that is required when people use Asana for their core working team. Some of the metrics that they care about are like org paying weekly active users as well as really thinking about healthy project use. So we make sure that we understand what does good look like and what is a dynamic that we want to be creating in terms of people getting real value from using the product, and we build that into our metrics to have as a guardrail to ensure that we're not driving one metric at the expense of people really getting what they need out of Asana.

Lenny (00:12:41):
Just a couple more questions along these lines.

Paige Costello (00:12:44):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:12:44):
I'm nerd-sniped about process.

Paige Costello (00:12:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:12:46):
I think you use a process called the Double Diamond Process at Asana. Okay. Cool.

Paige Costello (00:12:49):
We do.

Lenny (00:12:50):
I've seen images of this in various places, but I don't know of any company that's actually using it as the process. Can you just describe what the Double Diamond Process is and how you use it?

Paige Costello (00:13:00):
So you might be familiar with lean startup concepts and Double Diamond as it relates to going broad, and then going narrow. So you go broad when you ask like, "What customer should I solve for?" and then you pick one, and then that's the narrowing. Then, you go broad, and you say, "What are the problems this customer has?" and you narrow, and you say, "This is the problem they have." Then, you go broad, and you say, "What solution should we do to this?" and then you go narrow, and you say, "This is the solution that we should start with." That process of going broad, and going narrow, and going broad, and going narrow forces people to get out of their opinion-driven lens because so often, we need to be curious quantitatively and qualitatively about what we're doing and why, and be more systematic and rigorous about getting there. It doesn't take long, but it just breaks the frame.

(00:13:56):
The Double Diamond Process that Asana effectively... Each of our typical reviews or artifacts sit at different inflection points on the Double Diamond. So we actually ask people to do a kickoff where they collect different information at different scale depending on the size of the problem and the ambiguity they're solving. Some people have already done enough customer selection and research that they're starting with, "What are the possible solutions to this problem?" and then they're bringing the spec, and that's the narrowing alongside design, et cetera. But it's really mapping our artifacts against this notion to make sure that the product thinking has that quality of decision-making. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:44):
The way you described it is it was very customer-target-oriented. Is that that the actual framework? Is it around who to build this for, and then what to build, or is it more... It is. Okay. You're not ahead?

Paige Costello (00:14:44):
It is. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:44):
Okay.

Paige Costello (00:14:56):
It's really important because then you also know what success looks like because if you pick your success metrics as using a feature, that's it. You're teaching to the test. It's not actually driving the outcome. So while our planning process is around effectively defining category and how we win, and making sure that customers receive certain benefits from using work management, the through line to the individual project that a team might be leading is they need to know who they're solving for and what it means to have that problem solved. So it always starts with enough customer insight such that we can creatively do what they're trying to do. I mean, really inventing on behalf of customers.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Can you maybe repeat if there's terms for each of those phases?

Paige Costello (00:15:49):
Yeah. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:15:49):
Then, is there an example of a feature or product that went through this that you could share? If nothing comes to mind, that's okay.

Paige Costello (00:15:55):
The inflection points are the kickoff, which is that going broad, and then customer and direction selection. So this is both the target as well as of the 10,000-foot views of how you might pursue solving this problem. Which path are you broadly going to take? Then, going broad within that path on different concepts, and then there's a design concept review. Then, the products spec. Then, the full experience review or design crit of the end-to-end experience and launch. So that launch review is often just, "Hey, here's the thing. Here's what we said. Here are the fast-follows." Most of the time, by that time, it's already been dogfooding internally for some time, and it's more of a formal, "Do we have the right metrics in place? Are we ready to ship?"

Lenny (00:16:52):
Awesome. Do these reviews happen in person, on Zoom, or asynchronous?

Paige Costello (00:16:56):
It depends. So it depends on the complexity of the work, and it depends how much we want to talk about it. A lot of our crits happen in person on the design side. A lot of spec reviews are more asynchronous, and then we'll say, "Depending on the number of questions people have, we call a meeting." Otherwise, we do mostly async, but it's a mix. It really depends on the complexity and ambiguity of the solution and how much people have questions about asynchronously beforehand.

Lenny (00:17:27):
I'm going to take a tangent with my questions here and talk about work from home policy at Asana. This is something that I've been wondering more and more about how it's changing because it feels like there's been a shift back to the office. So what is the current policy at Asana, and what's changed maybe over the past couple years?

Paige Costello (00:17:42):
Well, we were fully remote during the pandemic, and then we came back to the office in an office-centric hybrid format. So we're in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and then work from home mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. That dynamic has been designed from the start. We wanted to make sure that we took advantage of what's great about working together as teams, and so it's been the standard. So I would say what's unique about maybe Asana is we knew we would do that from the very beginning instead of hemming and hawing about would we be a remote workplace or not, and what would that mean, and how would we come together, and how would we budget for it. We're like, "No, this is going to be an office-centric hybrid," because we wanted to create spaces for people to work together and move quickly.

(00:18:37):
It's been interesting watching people get back into the swing of things. Even though we knew, it didn't mean that on day one, people were great at being in the office. People were taking standups sitting down. Whereas before, you would walk through our office, and you could hear people at standup because there were standup chants, and people would be out on the floor. Now, people are more likely to do their standup in a room, and we're trying the next level of standing up during a standup, but it's... I'm sure it's a shared experience for other people who are working in offices to get used to using the whiteboards again, to get used to standing up during your meetings. It's bizarre that we could lose a muscle that we had that was so innate so quickly, and I think even in the last month, I would say, and it's in June of 2023, there's more vibrancy in the office, more conversation, more casual... someone eating alone at the cafeteria, and someone sitting down next to them. So it didn't happen overnight.

Lenny (00:19:45):
I've been seeing a lot of tweets of founders just being like, "Work from home has failed. It's time to go back at the office." I'm curious if that ends up rolling into more and more companies, or if it's just a few founders here and there.

Paige Costello (00:19:56):
I think it's a real thing for mental health. I do think that having social casual relationships as well as more opportunities to talk strategy with people you're not forced into a meeting room with has been super beneficial. I can say that just today, I was having lunch and sat down with my head of data science, and we had an impromptu chat about how we review our experiments and how to evaluate whether we had ROI on learning, not just the metrics. It was one of those things where if we had to schedule it, it might not have happened, and if it did happen, it would have been a couple weeks from now.

Lenny (00:20:36):
It feels like just coming into the office once or twice... or sorry, being at home once or twice a week is not that different from how things used to be where there was a day of no meetings and a lot of people stayed from home. So it feels like it's almost reverting back to that.

Paige Costello (00:20:47):
Exactly, and people are better at it than they used to be.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Right.

Paige Costello (00:20:50):
So I would say our remote days are more impactful than the days we're together where we're getting into the swing of things.

Lenny (00:20:56):
Yeah. I feel like as a PM, the only day I was productive and getting real deep work done was the No-Meeting Wednesday. It was at Airbnb.

Paige Costello (00:21:04):
Yes. I would encourage you to know your chronotype and to lock that time where you have the most head space to do that work. So, for me, it's mornings.

Lenny (00:21:12):
Say more on chronotype. What is that?

Paige Costello (00:21:15):
I'm a morning person, and so I try to make sure that I don't have any meetings before 10:00, sometimes before 11:00, and that's when I do my hardest task for the day.

Lenny (00:21:26):
I also just thought about standups while I was at Airbnb and how not only how much energy they brought, but almost too much energy sometimes where there's like another team doing a standup, and they're just laughing and clapping, and we're just like, "Shh, we're trying to work over here." I feel like we need more of that again.

Paige Costello (00:21:42):
Totally. Yep, yep.

Lenny (00:21:45):
Okay. So, moving in a slightly different direction, something I heard about you is that you're often the youngest person in the room, and you often lead people with decades more experience than you. I want to ask, what have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics, especially when they're maybe more experienced or older, and especially in other functions, I don't know, execs or designers, engineers, what have you figured out there?

Paige Costello (00:22:13):
The thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product. If you can be the person in the room who has watched customers use the product and has a point of view about why one tool is significantly better or worse in a given dimension, and you can do that with confidence and clarity, and you don't need to know the other person's functional domain, and you don't need the expertise in what they're experts at, you can bring insight that makes people curious, and trust you, and just immediately believe that there's an opportunity that you're not advocating for that just is true. But I think that's a really tricky and unique thing is not to pretend like you have more experience than you do, but to be willing to ask great questions, and then be curious enough that you're bringing insight to every meeting that people may or may not have, but you're always willing to share.

Lenny (00:23:21):
That's such a good answer because it's like there's not a trick to it. It's just do the work, spend the time to become the person that has answers that people value and obviously, that will respect you, value your opinion, want to hear from you.

Paige Costello (00:23:34):
Yeah. Yeah. Our former board member, Anne Raimondi, and now our head of business wrote an article on First Round that was really great about the trust equation, and it really resonated with me. I don't know if you've heard about it, but she said that trust is equal to credibility plus reliability, plus authenticity, divided by or over perception of self-interest. I think when you're met by someone who doesn't know you, doesn't know your work, your job is to create credibility, and that's where I said bringing the insight is where you can really tip the scales here. Reliability, this is all about your say-do ratio. Authenticity is just being vulnerable, being yourself, and then making sure that people know that you're not in it for some other outcome or cause that perception of self-interest really can change whether people... how much they trust you.

Lenny (00:24:46):
In terms of knowing the insight and knowing thy customer, putting the time, I imagine, is a big element of that. Is that how you do that, or is there anything else along those lines that's just like, "Here's how I get really good at this?"

Paige Costello (00:24:59):
When you take a new role, become best friends with a researcher, and spend time watching customers use the product firsthand because what they maybe report on or are trying to do a study about might be very different from what you observe, but you really just need that front row seat with customers, and so asking, "How do I actually set up time with customers? How do I compensate them? How do I read the tickets?" Whatever. It's amazing how little you have to do to quickly catch up to understanding who the organization is solving for well and poorly, and how people really use your product versus how your teams use your product, especially in organizations where there are heavy dogfooding cultures. It's really risky to become less sensitive to the needs and behaviors of customers because people think they are their customer, and it also becomes very navel-gazey. So I think the more you get out and break up how people are having conversations about what we should do and why, and what we shouldn't do and why, and it's not about your opinion, it's about asking questions, and then bringing insight can really change the nature of the conversation and build trust.

Lenny (00:26:18):
I love that. In terms of confidence, you talked about the importance of communicating these things confidently. Is there anything you've learned about how to be more confident? The managing part of it is like having the answer, but is there anything there that you maybe coach your PMs around or other folks of just like, "Here's how you communicate confidence?"

Paige Costello (00:26:36):
It's a great question. I think being brave and courageous in little moments is just what you have to do. You have to show up, and say it before you're ready to say it, and ask for forgiveness, and be vulnerable. I think when you're vulnerable, people actually trust you more than if you come with all of this armor and say, "I know this, and this is how we're going to do it." So real confidence is often conveyed by being willing to ask the question or to say, "I don't know what you mean by that. Can you say that again?" It's also just how you communicate, looking people in the eye, your body position, your body language.

(00:27:22):
So much of this, I think people forget about because it's really easy to be in a meeting, and looking at your computer, and going through Slack messages. So one of the best things you can do is if you're in a meeting, be in that meeting. Continually scan the faces of everyone in the room, see if someone has a question, pause at the beginning, and welcome people, and chit-chat while people land, and then close asking questions like, "Did I get all of that? Is there anything you would've expected to cover that we missed?" It's really about being open, and that conveys confidence more than being assertive and advocating 100% of the time.

Lenny (00:28:03):

(00:29:04):
From my chats with folks that you work with, it's really clear that you put a lot of time and energy into mentoring and coaching PMs, and your team, and I think probably broadly at Asana. One thing specifically that came up is that you're very big on leading and teaching by example, not just, "Here's how you do this thing." So, if that's true, I'm curious where that came from for you and why you think that ends up being a lot more successful than like, "In a meeting, you should do X, Y, Z," versus doing it, and then letting them see.

Paige Costello (00:29:34):
I think the main thing is repetition. We're all students of repetition. If you see something done a few times, you're more likely to remember it and internalize it, and so it's also something that... a way that I learn, and so I think that's probably part of it. I remember hearing about a framework called the three Es: experience, exposure, and education. I think it was helpful for me to hear that as a way of growing your career or being more purposeful about your growth because I think when people are earlier in their careers, they tend to think, "Education, education, education," and then they started to think, "Experience, experience. How do I get the experience of being a manager? I need to read about it, and then be a manager." It's very linear.

(00:30:29):
Exposure was such an important one where I thought like, "Okay. So you're not in the driver's seat, but you're in the car, and you hear what's happening, and you're evaluating how this is... what the impact is." This goes back to being really present and analytical, and being a learner because if you can be a learner, not just in an education or experience context, but in an exposure context, you can really grow so much more quickly and in so many more directions than you will get from just what does your day entail from what work is directly required of you.

Lenny (00:31:12):
Is there an example of that happening either to you or you saw a manager leader do this, and you're like, "Oh, I get it now," or you doing that and it helped?

Paige Costello (00:31:18):
So I'll give two examples. I mean, the way I run my meetings are the kind of meetings I want to be a part of. So I try to make sure that I start with a clear agenda, and I move quickly, but give time for conversation and that it's not fully just sharing information, but debating where appropriate. I think knowing how to manage the conversation and courteously pausing people who are going on too long or taking the group in a different direction than was intended, and just think about the experience of everyone there, and create the experience that you hope that they're creating in the rooms that you're not a part of.

(00:32:08):
An example that I have in terms of experience is sometimes the experience is you doing the thing and getting that experience firsthand. Other times, you need an education, you need a mentor, you need a coach who will tell you what they're saying or give you advice. I was in a really high-stakes product review at Intuit, and at the end of it, everyone else had left, and the leader of the business unit as she was leaving the room said, "Always answer the question that they should have asked." "Always answer the question they should have asked."

(00:32:49):
I was pretty surprised by that advice because it was very profound in the moment because I think when you're a student and you are accustomed... If you're an achiever, you like to get As. You're probably going to hear a question and answer it. You're like, "One-to-one, one-to-one, one-to-one." But what I learned from that was that there's actually another altitude, another point of strategy when you're in a meeting or in a conversation to make sure that you're covering the more important point, the bigger picture, the alternative that the person asking the question maybe didn't see or consider. So I think the mix of experience, exposure, and education really helps you make sure that you're consciously moving forward on each of those fronts or finding people who can help you there.

Lenny (00:33:43):
I love that piece of advice, and it makes me want to ask, are there other pieces of advice that have been really impactful to you, or are there common pieces of advice you give to your team that just is a recurring theme of advice that maybe people even make fun of like, "Oh, Paige is always saying this?"

Paige Costello (00:33:59):
There are a few ways to think about advice, and my advice often meets some mark when it's for a particular person in a particular time in their career. So I would say advice I love giving to people who are early in their career is don't self-select because I think it's really easy to say, "I don't have the experience," or, "I'm not X, Y, Z enough," and not apply. So I really push people not to self-select, and I try to remind myself where that's appropriate to do the same thing. Other advice I often give is just think big, ship small. "Think big, ship small." What's the smallest thing you can do to do that thing? But let's not, because we're trying to ship all the time and in small chunks, start thinking in small ways because it's really easy to get a little too incremental, a little too wrapped around the axle around optimizing a metric and miss the bigger picture, and so think big ship small is another piece of product advice I give.

(00:35:02):
The last piece of advice that I would say that I like is more of a way of thinking. So this is a little abstract, but when employees join Asana, they get a book called The 15 Commitments of a Conscious Leader. It's led by the Conscious Leadership Group. They also get two-day training on some language and tools for how to effectively work with other people, and it's a really... For me at least, it was transformational because I learned some vocabulary and methods that I could share with my peers. One of the things that you learn is to be above or below the line, and something that is this concept of like, "Where are you? Are you above the line? Are you below the line?" If you're above the line, you're committed to learning. You're open and curious. Things are funny here, more playful. If you're below the line, you're committed to winning. You're committed to being right. Things are more black and white.

(00:36:10):
All of us have days where we're having a conversation and we're really in that below line space where it's like, "No, it just is this way. There's no two ways around it." That concept of understanding your personal head space, and then being mindful of how you're operating when you're in that place really was great advice for me and also recognizing where other people were when it related to decisions we were making or context. It also helped me think about rejecting false trade-offs and challenging like... Effectively, there's this notion of how might the opposite be true, and that's a piece of advice that I give myself like this morning.

(00:36:55):
I think it was yesterday, actually. I was like, "How am I going to do tomorrow? Tomorrow, I have to deliver the clarity pillar brief to the area leads and make sure they understand our stack ranked metrics, and they need to know exactly what our strategic priorities are and why, and they need nudges, and they need to be able to translate our voice of business and usability lists into those plans. I need to establish a perspective and make sure this is all written down and they really understand it, and I have a great conversation with them where I get open questions and they feel like they can really challenge my thinking. I also am having a podcast with Lenny in the afternoon. Ugh." Right?

(00:37:37):
At first, it was like, "This is just too much. I should try to move or cancel one of these." Then, I asked myself, "How might the opposite be true?" I was like, "I can do both." It was just enough to pop the balloon because sometimes your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. The moment I challenged myself and said, "How might the opposite be true?" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine. We'll have a great conversation. I'm ready to show up, and be curious, and really engage with you on the topics that you've found interesting, and we'll just do that. So, "How might the opposite be true?" has been a really helpful piece of advice or line of questioning that I use with myself to make sure that I'm not taking myself away.

Lenny (00:38:43):
Wow. What a fruitful question that ended up being. That was amazing. How does clarity pillars strategy go? Are people into it? Is it working?

Paige Costello (00:38:52):
Yeah. I'm pumped. It's a really interesting time to be a product leader, especially with all of the tech transform... Truly, the technological transformation on LLMs is astonishing, the pace of development, the ability of our teams to just ship quickly and ship really intelligent things. We're not in an operational "figure it out" land. We're not in a place where we're trying to decide how to do a better job and get it out to customers. We really have lots of interesting paths forward and are trying to make sure that we're on the cutting edge while really looking at like, "What does it mean to serve the companies and organizations that we want to serve with new ways of serving them?" So it was a really fun conversation, and I also had to be honest with people and say, "This is a 70% cut. 30% of this is missing or incorrect, and that's why I'm coming to you early." So I think it went really well, and it's the start of our 12-month rolling planning conversation.

Lenny (00:40:05):
Let me pull on this AI thread because it's clearly top of mind for a lot of people.

Paige Costello (00:40:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:09):
How do you think about splitting up investment in AI exploration within the product team? Are you like, "Hey, team. Everyone should be thinking about AI as part of their product," or is it there's a team where they're going to think about AI and LLM integrations and, "Everyone else, keep doing what you're doing?"

Paige Costello (00:40:24):
We've had an ML team for quite some time, making sure that we have test prioritization models and notification prioritization models, and are making our product less work for people to use. But when it came to the massive leap forward in LLMs recently, we staffed a team to really prototype quickly, and discover what was possible, and just apply hypotheses outside of the typical norms of how we work. So they went straight to prototyping instead of going through that Double Diamond I was explaining earlier. What that meant was that we were really quickly able to say, "Wow, this is just so much better than we imagined and would never have prioritized it because we thought it would take so much longer." Then, in other cases, "That sounded good in theory."

(00:41:18):
So skipping a lot of that to just really try it on for a size has been key, and then what we're doing is giving the teams with the most expertise in the customer problems. For example, status and progress reporting, the keys to that car and saying like, "Here's the starter. Here's the hypothesis. Here's how far we got with it. It's dogfooding. What do you want to do?" So we're able to nudge people without wasting time and build the skills locally within the teams that then move those experiences forward.

Lenny (00:41:50):
I want to come back to the coaching topic. I had a few questions there that I moved off of, but I feel like that's a rich area of exploration. You mentioned Intuit. You worked at Intuit. Intuit is famous for having a really good APM program and really good training for product managers. What did you take away from that experience that you bring with you to coaching or even I think there's an APM program at Asana, too?

Paige Costello (00:42:15):
Intuit had excellent training programs, the APM program and their manager training. So, on the PM front, the biggest thing that they taught was around customer centricity, and it really started with the founding of the company. For anyone who works at Intuit or has worked at Intuit, they know that there's this story about Scott Cook watching his wife balancing her checkbook at the kitchen table, and staring at it, and saying, "There's got to be a better way, a software." So it was very typical for the product training at Intuit to be all about like, "How do you actually watch customers using your product or just doing the things they do, collecting the artifacts, knowing the workarounds, and using that experience to build opportunities for surprise and insight that then you can capitalize and create products around?" They also are very specific about how they define durable advantage and think about, overall, the product process from a place of customer insight through to the market landscape. So the PM program there was absolutely super thoughtful, especially for taking someone who has never PMed into being a super skilled PM.

(00:43:37):
They also have a wonderful manager training program, and I think the biggest thing that I took away from their manager training was really on the feedback slide. So delivering feedback is something that I think everyone benefits from, but for managers, it's so much more critical because if you don't do it, and you don't say what you mean, and you don't do it in a way that it can be internalized and acted upon, you really don't set up your teammates, your teams for growth or success in their careers. So their program for helping you think about like, "Okay. I'm going to convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing. Impact, made me feel like you weren't listening to me or made me feel like your voice was more important than mine, or impact, blah, blah, blah."

(00:44:35):
It doesn't matter what the impact is because the way you've set it up is it's a subjective observation. It's not what the camera recorded, it's what you experienced. Therefore, it is true and valuable feedback, and it gets the conversation started such that you can then talk about next steps. That format and framing really helped me understand that delivering feedback isn't about being right or about getting the right information to the other person. It's about sharing the impact of different decisions that they're making. So, especially if you have to give feedback about, God forbid, what someone wears to the office, or how do you feel their work is, or how they're communicating or their body language, having an enough support where you can be really clear about what you're intending and the spirit behind that, but that it's formalized enough that people can really engage with it has been enormously helpful, and I still use it today.

Lenny (00:45:35):
It's interesting how some of the most impactful training is such soft skills.

Paige Costello (00:45:41):
So basic.

Lenny (00:45:43):
Basic. Yeah.

Paige Costello (00:45:43):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:45:44):
It's just how to give someone some feedback, but it's like, "Know how to prioritize, how to do a meeting, how to give a presentation."

Paige Costello (00:45:48):
No. Yeah.

Lenny (00:45:50):
It's like, "Here's how you give feedbacks."

Paige Costello (00:45:52):
Yep.

Lenny (00:45:53):
So you've worked with a lot of early product managers. I'm curious what you find most holds back new PMs and help them being successful in their career, and even on the flip side, what most helps new PMs be successful in terms of skills or behaviors, habits, things like that?

Paige Costello (00:46:11):
I would say this illusion that you have to be all-knowing and super confident sets you up to be in a place of advocacy instead of inquiry. So PMs who are newer in their careers or who are in a different space than they're accustomed to working really want to be pro really fast. What pro means is trying to cut that straight path, and that can reduce information and conversation that makes you smarter. So some of the challenges that some PMs face are feeling like they need to be the expert, they need to be the smartest person in the room, or God forbid, they think they're the smartest person in the room.

(00:46:56):
Then, what happens is they're really doing that customer, or product discovery, or spec in a little dark room. Then, they show up, and they say, "This is it. This is right. I know it's right, and let's do this as quickly as possible." Everyone else says, "Wait. What? I don't know. I have a question," or they don't, and they still have a question, which is even worse. So I would say something that really holds PMs back is not being collaborative from a place of true curiosity like performative collaboration where they're not in a room or want to do a review, but ultimately, they don't really want the questions or the feedback.

(00:47:40):
I think trying to make sure that you can be in a place of curiosity and openness because that will make your experience more successful is really important. Other people aren't always going to be right, but if you're present for it, you can ask clarifying questions. You can ask the question behind the question. You can hear the feedback, and then say, "Was that something that I must do, that I should do, or that I should consider?" You can actually develop a conversation that will move your relationship forward, and so I would say that's something that I think holds PMs back.

(00:48:17):
PMs tend to be so ambitious and career-centric. There are so many good things about that, but I would say don't let the sound of your wheels drive you crazy. If you're present in your job, and you actually have fun with it and solve the problems, people will come out of the woodwork, say, "You're great, and tell your boss you should be promoted." You don't need to ask for a promotion. Your outcomes should speak for themselves. Yes, you should have sponsors and people who advocate for you, but a lot of that just comes from that raw connection to the work and to your team.

Lenny (00:48:55):
Everyone I talked to about you is like, "Oh my god, I love Paige." I could see why, but I want to ask you a question. I imagine you've made some mistakes either with a product or your career. I'd love to hear a story of something that went wrong and what you learned from that experience. This might be the last question, depending where you take it.

Paige Costello (00:49:16):
I would say that all of the advice I've given so far is directly related to things I've learned the hard way. So, especially as an IC moving into a management role, you aren't supposed to have all the answers. You need to ask better questions. You need to be thoughtful about direction and agency. So I would say one of the missteps here is knowing how to give guidance or direction in a way that doesn't feel like micromanagement because what you're trying to do is to teach a repeatable pattern instead of giving a precise instruction that can be used once, and then disposed of.

(00:49:57):
So I think that's a pretty common manager path issue, but I think the faster you learn it, and observe it, and use techniques to manage it, the better. So, for example, I would go to my meetings with a stack of Post-Its, and I would write what I wish I was saying on Post-Its and see if someone else would say it first. Then, if by the end of the meeting, I had decided that I still had a Post-It or two that was worthwhile, I would say them. But you've got to police yourself because no one else will do it because no matter how accessible you think you are, other people know that you're the boss. They're not going to necessarily speak over you or challenge you directly.

(00:50:42):
Another challenge I had is I'm a very optimistic person, and I like to look on the bright side. I'm very positive, and I think depending on the culture you're working with or depending on your team, sometimes they need to hear what's really bad, and they need you to be really real, and they need you to tell them like it is. Something I realized was that I had an experience where I didn't realize that people didn't think I was being authentic because they thought something was bad, and I wasn't talking about it, but it wasn't because I didn't think it was bad or didn't see. It was just because my nature was to say, "Well, I'm not going to talk about bad things because we're doing the things we need to do." As long as the plan is good, I wasn't really highlighting all the problems I saw or really pushing on those head on with my team, and so they felt like they didn't know what I was seeing or if we were saying the same things. That was really an interesting experience. Yeah, there were just so many. Yeah.

Lenny (00:51:49):
With that second lesson, is there something you've changed in the way you lead and operate where you now found a way to communicate, "Here's wrong," in a way that's still maybe optimistic and productive?

Paige Costello (00:52:00):
I try to be more real with myself and others. I try to show up and say like, "Hey, this is incomplete." For example, even the thing I did this morning, the clarity brief. I said, "This is 70% finish. The 30% that I don't believe is there yet are these three things. I don't feel confident in this piece of it, and hopefully, we'll have more clarity by next week." So that's an example of just being as real with the small things as with the big things so that people can balance their perspective of you and your work, and the organization and the environment you're creating.

Lenny (00:52:40):
I'm curious how you think about your career going forward. How far out do you think where you want to be, and how do you plan out the future of Paige's career?

Paige Costello (00:52:50):
I try to be really intentional about staying as much as leaving a role. When I think about my career as a whole, I try to think about skills or experiences I want to have as opposed to roles, or companies, or specific problems. So something that I think about is... Effectively, I evaluate whether I'm in a healthy role and in a good setup by asking myself about my learning curve like, "Is the steepness of my learning curve doing me a favor here?" because sometimes you might love the organization, love the problem, and feel like you're just not learning, or learning fast enough, or being challenged.

(00:53:39):
That's something that I think is really important. So thinking about the learning curve, thinking about whether the environment is positively impacting your ability to grow your career and make an impact. So, environmentally, you might have not enough staffing or tooling, or have someone in the management team who is toxic, or have a peer who is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That stuff matters, and I think people don't talk about it or take it seriously enough that your environment should include people who are advocating for you, and it should just be a place where you feel you've got the right ingredients to set you up to do the good work.

(00:54:24):
Then, the third piece is really around just the problem, the problem your product is solving. Is it fun? Is it interesting? I often like to think about passions are made, not found because I think people... We do this with nine-year-olds. We say, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" They look cross-eyed, and they say, "An astronaut. Just getting a vet. I don't know." There's this moment of panic, and I would say that being comfortable, saying like, "Go try different things, and see if the problem is interesting to you and if the problem is fun or interesting to you." It doesn't mean it has to be sexy. It doesn't mean the company needs to have a brand name. It just has to be something that you're curious about so that you do a better job at your job. So I would say learning curve environment and problem are things that I use to assess like, "Am I still on the right path, or should I consider an alternative?" But when I think about my own career, I really think about skills and experiences as opposed to roles. So I would say that that's more my frame of reference because otherwise, I think I am living in the future and not enough trying to make the most out of the career I'm living right now.

Lenny (00:55:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Paige Costello (00:55:49):
Yeah. Let's do it.

Lenny (00:55:51):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Paige Costello (00:55:54):
My go-to book recommendation for other PMs is inspired by Marty Cagan. I think it's a classic. The other books that I have enjoyed and recommended lately are The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

Lenny (00:56:11):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Paige Costello (00:56:14):
Ooh, I'm very much enjoying The Diplomat right now, and then TV show or movie. Let's see. I just watched the Fire of Love documentary, which is about a couple who study volcanoes, and that was a great change of pace.

Lenny (00:56:32):
I saw the trailer for that. I think I got to watch that, and I finished The Diplomat. It's awesome. It ends really well.

Paige Costello (00:56:37):
I'm not done. Don't spoil it.

Lenny (00:56:39):
But it's just good. I'm just saying it's good. That's not spoiling.

Paige Costello (00:56:39):
Okay.

Lenny (00:56:45):
Okay. Next question. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Paige Costello (00:56:49):
The good news is I can tell you this and still keep asking it because the answer has always come up differently. So I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it? Yada, yada." Effectively, the question gets that, "When the product failed," When something about the team didn't work," just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work, and evaluating people's mindset, and the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation. I think it's a great question. Really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (00:57:34):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?

Paige Costello (00:57:37):
I've been playing a lot with Poe.com lately. Yeah, just an opportunity to learn more about LLM capabilities in a firsthand way. It's been fun to create little bots. I'm playing with making a page bot. I can't say that the page bot could have had this conversation yet, but maybe next year at this time, you can have a conversation with the other me.

Lenny (00:58:07):
That's what the page bot would say if this was the page bot talking right now.

Paige Costello (00:58:10):
I would say though that the advice, bits and bobs, I gave you earlier are absolutely things that I've been thinking about feeding, but I think the page bot would probably say, "Ship it."

Lenny (00:58:25):
Poe. It's the Quora founder's LLM chat bot?

Paige Costello (00:58:30):
Yeah, and so you can try the different models. So you can do four, and you play five, and Claude, and a few others. Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:38):
There's also a lennybot.com for folks that haven't seen this. Actually, there's a whole post on my newsletter of how it was built, and you get a lennybot.com. It is trained on all of my newsletter posts, and I think... not yet podcasts, but someday it will have podcasts.

Paige Costello (00:58:55):
Ooh.

Lenny (00:58:55):
By the way, someone listening to this, we're looking for someone to maintain this bot and evolve it. So if you're really into this stuff and have done this sort of thing, please DM me on Twitter. I'm looking for someone to take over lennybot.com, make it more... Moving on. Enough about me. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Paige Costello (00:59:18):
One of the biggest ones is just, once again, being real about how many reviews and approvals it takes for something to get done and who's actually responsible for reviewing and approving work. So we got really aggressive about, functionally, who is in charge and at what level for a given review, and pushed to say to actually have limits on the number of people per meeting, on the number of sub-task reviews for a given body of work. What this did is it created a lot more agency and pace within given working teams. So what we did was we said, "We actually don't care. We don't want a daisy chain of approvals. We just want one person with whom the buck can stop with them, and they can be responsible for how the work moves forward such that the knowledge is known and we could have connected the dots more effectively than we do or did." So that's the logic there, and it really changed the pace and quality of our work.

Lenny (01:00:25):
I love that. Is there any more you could share, a number? What is the maximum? Is there anything that other people maybe can take as a-

Paige Costello (01:00:31):
Yeah. So no more than three reviews on a given piece of work where people are blocking one approver. If a meeting has more than 10 people on it, we ask the person hosting the meeting to kick out the other people and write better decision notes.

Lenny (01:00:49):
The three reviews is three meetings looking at the product as it's coming together, basically?

Paige Costello (01:00:54):
The three reviews are three people who are assigned a task to look at something, but only one person is blocking whether it moves to the next stage.

Lenny (01:01:03):
Got it. Informed people? Stakeholders?

Paige Costello (01:01:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:06):
Decision-makers? Okay. Great. Final question. You work at Asana. What is your favorite Asana pro tip?

Paige Costello (01:01:12):
I use Asana to run all my meetings and assign pre-reads. So I use the multi-assign feature in subtasks all the time where I make a task with a due date that says, "Read this thing by this date," and then I assign it to a team or a set of individuals like that really quickly. Then, when I'm in the meeting, I take notes live in a task, and then highlight parts of those notes, and convert them into subtasks so that none of the action items get lost.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Wow. You need to make a video or blog post about this. Not only is it using Asana to build Asana, it's using Asana to run teams within Asana.

Paige Costello (01:01:46):
Yeah. It definitely does that, but-

Lenny (01:01:57):
Asana all the way down.

Paige Costello (01:01:58):
People know who's responsible for what they want.

Lenny (01:02:01):
Amazing. Paige, you are awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Paige Costello (01:02:10):
You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter, Paige Costello, and on Twitter, @paigenow. Listeners, well, I'd love to hear how you think AI is going to shape the future of software for knowledge workers, but in particular, if you and your team use Asana, I'd love to know where you'd like to see AI playing a bigger role to drive efficiency alignment for your team. So, as you know, we offer a ton of goal management, work management pieces that help teams and orgs do their work together, and I'd love to hear from you about where you see the opportunity.

Lenny (01:02:49):
Awesome. Paige, again, thank you so much for being here.

Paige Costello (01:02:53):
My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:02:55):

# What AI means for your product strategy | Paul Adams (CPO of Intercom)

## Transcript

Paul Adams (00:00:00):
This is a meteor coming towards you. This is going to radically transform society. And I think if people don't explore AI properly, it will leave them behind. I'd start with the thing your product does. "What's the core premise behind it? Why do people use it? What problem does it solve for them?" That kind of thing. So, go back to basics. And then ask, "Can AI do that?" And for a lot, the answer is going to be, "Yes, it can." For some it might be, "It can partially do it." And then, maybe for others, "It can't do that, at least not yet." And then, for some of it'll be replacement, AI would replace, it'll just do it. And, in other places, it'll be augmentation. It'll augment. It'll help people. But yeah, I think that you've got to match your product, and what AI can do, and what it will be able to do, and then ask yourself, "Okay, what are we going to do?"

Lenny (00:00:52):
Today my guest is Paul Adams. Paul is chief product officer at Intercom, a role that he's held for over 10 years. Prior to this role, he was global head of brand design at Facebook, a user researcher at Google, a product designer at Dyson, and his first job was an automotive interior designer. In our conversation, Paul shares some amazing stories of failure, including the story of him giving a huge presentation where he froze on stage and had to walk off. And what he learned from these experiences of failure. We then get deep into how to think about AI as a part of your product strategy, including a ton of great examples from Intercom's experience going all in on AI. Paul also shares some of his favorite frameworks, and product lessons, and so much more.

(00:01:34):
This is the first recording I've ever done not from my home studio, instead from a hotel room. So, this is a fun experiment for us all. With that, I bring you Paul Adams after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

Paul Adams (00:04:14):
Thanks, Lenny. Nice to be here.

Lenny (00:04:15):
It's nice to have you here. I've heard so many good things about you from so many different people, so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this. Also, you have an Irish accent, which is always a boost for ratings in my experience, so thank you for bringing that with you here.

Paul Adams (00:04:26):
Yeah, that's nice to hear.

Lenny (00:04:28):
I wanted to start with a couple stories. So the first is your story of giving a keynote at Cannes. Can you share what happened there?

Paul Adams (00:04:38):
Yeah, some things that happened in work are very memorable at the time and they don't really scar you. This goes in the book that have scarred for life. Yeah, it's good. Long story short, I was at Facebook just over a decade ago. Loved it at the time. I think it was a great place to be at the time. And, basically San Francisco, I did a lot of talks for Facebook internally and externally. Facebook had a keynote slot, always had a keynote slot at Cannes, the world's biggest advertising festival. And, the year prior, Zuck had been interviewed. He was the speaker, he'd been interviewed. He'd gotten a hard time on privacy. It didn't go well as well as they'd hoped.

(00:05:14):
So, the next year they asked me to do it. Maybe it was the Irish accent that made the offer come my way. And, yeah, I got out and spun a stage, the world's biggest advertising stage. And, I'd say, I was three, four minutes into the talk, a very similar talk when I'd given lots of times. And, I just froze. I couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. It was the first ever time in my life I'd rehearsed the talk word for word. Usually, I have talking points, and things get mixed around, and it's informal. This was media trained, "Do not say the wrong thing." Kind of talk. And I just could not remember what to say. I had some version of a panic attack, walked off-stage, I was still mic'd up, cursed. Everyone started laughing. I was like, "Geez, are they laughing at me? Oh my God, this is..."

(00:06:06):
But, I managed to turn it around, I walked back out. I'd been disarmed internally in my head. And, the most of it went well. And I was famous that night. Out in Cannes afterwards on whatever the sea front, it's just like rose everywhere. And yeah, I was famous and infamous for my performance.

Lenny (00:06:26):
I feel like you lived the worst nightmare that everybody has when they're thinking about giving a talk. And, I think what's interesting is you survived. And, I think that's a really interesting lesson is you could freeze in front of thousands of people, walk off-stage, and then it works out okay.

Paul Adams (00:06:43):
Yeah. And it all happened organically, I guess, or very naturally. But yeah, ever since then, every time I walk out onto a conference talk stage, still today, I have this tiny doubt in the back of my head. It's never happened since. But yeah, I think you have to go with it with these things, when life throws you these, whatever, curveballs you have got to adapt and it's not that big a deal. None of these things are that big a deal, at the end of the day. You move on and live and learn. So yeah, but I still hope it doesn't happen again.

Lenny (00:07:15):
I also hate public speaking and I always fear this is exactly what's going to happen to me. And so, I think this is nice to hear, that even when the worst possible thing basically happens, things can survive.

Paul Adams (00:07:27):
You can turn it around. Yeah.

Lenny (00:07:29):
A second area I wanted to hear from is your time at Google. And, there's a couple products you worked on at Google. Both of them were not what you'd call big successes. And then, there's a transition to Facebook, which was also messy. Can you just share a couple stories from that time?

Paul Adams (00:07:45):
Yeah. Similar to the walking on stage thing, you live and learn. And, I was at Google for four years now and I was at Facebook for two and a half years or so. And, in both of those companies, this is at the height of... The social tech wave was at its peak. Google were very afraid of the existential threat posed by Facebook. Facebook were very confident they could pull off some new social advertising unit that would be an AdWords or something like that, that would destroy Google's revenue, eat them from the inside out. And so, being there at the time was fascinating and moving to the new companies. At Google, I worked on a lot of failed social projects, like you mentioned. Google Buzz, Google Ventilator, Google Plus. I think, a lot of the motivation for those projects came from a place of fear. It didn't come from a place of, "Let's make a great product for people. Let's really understand the things people struggle with when communicating with family and friends. Let's really, really try and create something wonderful." It came from a place of fear.

(00:08:47):
And so, during those times, I learned I think how not to lead in places. And by the way, I should say, at the time in Google, there was other things happening that were amazing, like Google were building Google Maps, an incredible product. One of my favorite products. I think one of the best products ever made. They were building Android. I was in the mobile team and the mobile apps team at the time, the Android came out. So, they can make an incredibly good product. So, I just happened to be in the social side, which wasn't as good. And, yeah, Google Buzz is a privacy disaster, and Google Plus is similar.

(00:09:24):
And so, halfway through I'd published research about groups and I'd done a ton of research. An interesting side note there is, at the time, I was working in the UX team as a researcher, I was been asked to do a lot of tactical research, like usability study type stuff, like can people use these products? And, I ended up doing a lot of formative research as well in the same session. So, I'd say to the team, "Hey, I'll do the research. I'll answer your questions. But also, I'm going to do this other thing, and I'm going to take 20 minutes doing that." And so, what we used to do is, what I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And, we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months. And the same pattern emerged every single time, which was, people need way better ways to communicate with small groups of family and friends.

(00:10:17):
And I look back now and go like, "WhatsApp." Or it may be iMessage if everyone's on Apple. But, really obvious in hindsight. But at the time, not obvious. And so, we tried to build a product around that called Google Plus. But, again, it came from the wrong place. And so, halfway through, the research that I've done, all this research had been made public through a conference talk. And, Facebook noticed, got in touch, one thing led to another, and I left and joined Facebook, which was an amazing thing for me, personally.

(00:10:51):
Facebook was an amazing place at the time and exciting. And they were trying to do things for the other reasons, the good reasons. "Okay, let's build an amazing product for people."

Lenny (00:11:01):
And this was during Google Plus being built, you basically shifted.

Paul Adams (00:11:04):
Yeah, midway, I'm stressed to even tell you about it. The project hadn't been launched, it was still under wraps. It was highly confidential. Google had done a lot of things at the time that were the first for them. I don't know if they've done them since. But things like, everyone worked in Google Plus was sent to a different building. That building had a different key card. If you didn't work in Google Plus you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And, as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google Plus. And so, when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably. Other people thought I was enlightened, too fancy you talked to. But it was the right thing for me to do. But at the time, it was a hard thing to do.

Lenny (00:11:56):
I know there's also a lot of scrutiny in what you took with you and the process.

Paul Adams (00:12:01):
Yeah, when I left, Google assumed that I was one of the spies. I was quarantined. I told them I was leaving. They forensically analyzed my laptop, all sorts of stuff like that. So, it was pretty intense. Looking back, I can understand why that happened. But the root cause for me is that the project has been run from a place of competitive fear, which I don't think leads to good things.

Lenny (00:12:32):
So one of the themes through the stories you just shared is, let's say, failure is... I don't want to make it that harsh, but just things not working out. And, I'm curious as a product leader, how important you think that is for people to go through, if you think that's something that is almost a good thing? And, I guess just is there anything there that you find helpful as a coach, as a mentor, as two people that are trying to become basically you?

Paul Adams (00:12:58):
Very, very. It still is. It still is. I've personally failed so many times. There are two stories and the Google one is long deep tentacles. They're two stories. I failed a ton of times. I remember, when I was at Facebook I was very happy. And, I knew Eoghan and Des, the co-founders of Intercom. And, they were trying to persuade me to join Intercom. We were like, it was a 10-person company at the time. But, Eoghan said something to me at that time which has stuck with me ever since. He said, "At Facebook, you can design the product. But at Intercom, you can design the company." And, that was extremely appealing to me, a great pitch. He's like, "Just design the company with us that you want to work in."

(00:13:41):
And so, part of that was a company that embraces failure, that says it's okay to try things. I'm a big believer in big bets, high risk, high reward. I don't get as excited about incremental things. No, I haven't said that. There's of course a place for that too, especially as companies get bigger. But, I get excited about big bets. And if you make big bets, you're going to get a lot of it wrong. So a lot of the principles that we built here at Intercom are in building software.

(00:14:09):
We have a principle called Ship to Learn. And, we've actually changed it since. It's over on the wall here. Ship fast, ship early, ship often is what it says now. You say Ship to Learn. Ship fast, ship early, ship often. So, in that idea is the idea of failure. It's not going to go right. And, it's going to go wrong more often than not. But if you ship early, and fast, and learn fast, you can change fast, and you can improve fast. And, that's the culture that we, as much as possible, try to embrace and teach people. But it's much easier said than done.

Lenny (00:14:43):
Yeah. Especially when you're in the moment like, "God dammit. Everything's going to fall apart. I really messed this one up."

Paul Adams (00:14:48):
Yeah. And there's a trade-off with quality that people really struggle with. We've high standards of ourselves. A lot of Intercom comes from a design founder background. We value the craft a lot. We never want to be embarrassed by what we ship. So there's a real tension there, a real trade-off, where people have these high standards, which we encourage. We encourage them to ship fast, and learn, and make mistakes. It's a constant tension that we're navigating.

Lenny (00:15:17):
Speaking of taking big bets and going all in, I know there's been a huge shift at Intercom to move towards AI and embrace AI. And so, maybe just to start broadly, I'm curious just what are some of your broader insights or surprises so far in how you've thought about AI and how you think AI will integrate into product and product strategy?

Paul Adams (00:15:39):
What day that ChatGPT launch? November 29th, I think, last year. Ever since that day, I literally wake up every day thinking about AI pretty much. And, I read as much as possible and still feel like I'm way behind in it. I think, for me, when I talk to you about AI, people typically fall into one of two camps. You're either all in, really truly all in. This is a meteor coming towards you. This is bigger than mobile as a technology shift, as big as the internet. Maybe it's bigger than the internet itself as a technology shift, the way it'll shape society. So I'm all in. I've gone over the hill or whatever. I'm over the other side. And so, there's people in that camp.

(00:16:23):
And then, I think there's people in another camp, which is, "I've heard this before. It's hype. Last year was crypto. It was Web3. None of those things worked out. There was the metaverse." So, there's definitely I think a lot of skepticism or maybe cynicism around it. And I don't understand why. The other things didn't really pan out. The metaverse is coming back. And, I'm trying to remember, there's the law where you have the hype, and then the trough of disillusionment, and then you come out the other side.

Lenny (00:16:54):
Yeah, that little curve.

Paul Adams (00:16:55):
Yeah. And I think that's where a lot of people might be, where there was so much hype, it was so noisy, and still is a little bit so noisy that you tune it out a little bit. And, I think, some people have fallen into that camp. I'm all in in the other camp. This is going to radically transform society and it blows my mind even seeing new types of things that come out, like ChatGPT Vision just came out recently, and just seeing the things that people can do with it. And we're just scratching the surface still. So, we're all in, for sure.

Lenny (00:17:31):
Awesome. I want to unpack that. But, I think there's also this camp of people that like, "Yes, something big is happening. I just don't have the time to understand, to build, to play around." What have you found and/or what advice would you share to people that are just like, "I want to go deeper down this rabbit hole. I just don't know where to start, because I have so much work to do already and this isn't a side thing."

Paul Adams (00:17:53):
The advice I have for people, and the advice I have for myself, I'm in that too, I wake up every day to too many emails, and Slack chats, and people knocking on my door, and my desk, and all things. So, this is a challenge for me too. You just have to take the time. There's just no other way for me. And that to me doesn't mean... It's about priorities. It doesn't mean that you need to work crazy hours. I don't believe in working crazy hours. I don't know what hours I work. I don't know, 50 hours a week maybe. I think, beyond that, you start to make bad decisions and things like that. You get tired. And you need to live the rest of your life. You got to put it into your day. Whether that's setting aside dedicated time to read.

(00:18:33):
Reading is the thing. You got to read. You got to stay up to date, and you got to play with things, and try things. If you don't have ChatGPT... If you don't have a... I can't remember if it's a pro licenser, whatever, but if you haven't upgraded to get access to things like GPT for Vision, where you can take photos and you have the mobile app. And I was going out for dinner last Friday night with my wife. I try not to take work to dinner with my wife. But, I wanted to try it. And, I took some photos of her food. And, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff, like tell you how healthy the meal is or whatever.

Lenny (00:19:07):
Oh, wow.

Paul Adams (00:19:07):
Anyway. You got to try it. You just got to try it. So, my advice people is, you've got to try it. You've got to set aside the time, or it'll pass you by. It does remind me the mobile wave about a decade ago. Again, I was at Google at the time, I was working on the mobile team. So I guess, it was my job to stay on top of things. But, at that time, some companies like Facebook went all in on it, maybe a bit late, but they eventually made the brave decision. I think if people don't explore AI properly, it will leave them behind.

Lenny (00:19:38):
It reminds me, I think, at Facebook, Zuck, and also Airbnb, Brian did this, is he said, "Any mocks you show me for new product designs have to be in a mobile app or on a mobile web. They can no longer be desktop for now."

Paul Adams (00:19:50):
Right. Yeah. Same with Facebook. Yeah, that's right.

Lenny (00:19:54):
I guess, do you think that that's the way to approach this is as a leader, just, "Everything you bring me needs to have some AI component." That sounds probably not like a good idea, but is there something that you're thinking about, or have done of just convincing people this is where you want to spend your time?

Paul Adams (00:20:05):
Yeah, it's harder, for sure. It's harder, because-

Lenny (00:20:08):
You don't want to force it.

Paul Adams (00:20:09):
... Yeah, a lot of the tech is invisible. We have a machine learning team we've had on here for a long time, so we've been working in this space for quite some time. But, it's funny, even if you go back 18 months, I think if I was on your podcast 18 months ago and you said to me like, "Hey, what do you think about AI?" I would've said something like, "It's not real. Machine learning's real, let's talk about that." So, things change, and my perception of it's changed. But a lot of the improvements are behind the scenes. They're with large language models or different types of things people are building in the background of infrastructure.

(00:20:43):
So I don't know what it looks like to design mobile mock-ups that are AI mock-ups. But I do think that people need to start really thinking strategically. Maybe it's just not a mock-up stage, but start to think really strategically about their product and whether it's in the line of the media, or it's coming or not. It's not everything is. And if so, for some I think they require a foundational strategic change. Others, it might be less so. But, I think that's actually the head space that I think people need to be in.

Lenny (00:21:17):
Can you impact that further? What does that look like to really think deeply about whether your product is in the way of the meteor?

Paul Adams (00:21:25):
You can get sidetracked by the technology, for sure. And I do. I just mentioned, hey, going out for dinner and taking a photo of my food. You can get sidetracked by the tech and some of it's really cool. I wouldn't start there. I'd start with the thing your product does. What's the core premise behind it? Why do people use it? What problem does it solve for them? That kind of thing. And then, ask the question. So go back to basics. "Okay, what is my product for? And why do people love it?' And then ask, "Can AI do that?" And for a lot the answer's going to be, "Yes, it can." For some, it might be, "It can partially do it." And then, maybe for others, "It can't do that, at least not yet."

(00:22:07):
So you're going to need to map what your product does against what AI can do. And AI can do a lot. It can write. I'll give you a list. It can write, it can summarize, it can summarize text, it can write text, it can answer queries, it can find facts, it can scan text, it can scan images. It can listen to your voice and repeat it. It can take actions. That's the next big thing coming. It can take actions, actually do things. It could like, I mean, "Hey AI. Whatever the AI is called. "Change my flight to Tuesday." Right? It can do things like that.

(00:22:46):
And so, it can do a lot of things. It can build rules. So, I think any product that has any workflow in it, which is almost all B2B SaaS products, any product that has multimedia in it, they're in the media line or whatever. I don't don't know if this metaphor is working. But, the media is coming and they're in its path. And so, for a lot of these products that you just need to look at what AI can do. And then, for some of it'll be replacement. AI would replace, it'll just do it. And, in other places it'll be augmentation. It'll augment. It'll help people as the copilot ideas that are going around. But yeah, I think that you've got to map your product, and what AI can do, and what it will be able to do, and then ask yourself, "Okay, what are we going to do?"

Lenny (00:23:33):
Is there an example of that at Intercom or a different company of, "Here's a problem we're trying to solve? Oh, AI can actually do this fully for us."

Paul Adams (00:23:40):
Oh, yeah. I'll give you Intercom first. Again, this date, I think it was November 29th, etched in our head. We have Fergal who was our head of machine learning. And, Fergal just turns around that day and he's like... Okay, I think he tweeted something actually. He had a tweet that day that was like, "This is it. This is the time. This is the moment. This is the before after." I actually often talk about people... because this is a framework I have, before, after moments. This is a before after moment. That was before. And that is after. And everything has changed. So, we literally ripped up our strategy almost entirely, and started again, from first principles and said, "Okay, why do people use Intercom?" Intercom is a customer support product. And then, very soon after that, Sam Altman, who's the founder and head of OpenAI, said, "Hey, one of the first industries that's going to be disrupted is customer service." We're like, "Yep."

(00:24:35):
So we did. We totally changed how we think, how we work, and we just went heads down and built a product called Fin. We built other things first actually. Fin came later, now that I think about it. But we went all in on it. It was a little bit of a bet the farm mindset. So we've done it. I think other companies like Google and Bard have to do it, and maybe they're a little bit slow, but it's so early in this tech cycle that, I think, they're fine. So yeah, we did. It was hard, but we had to do it.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Can you share briefly what Finn is just for folks that aren't familiar?

Paul Adams (00:25:16):
Fin, first and foremost, is an AI chatbot. So, if you think about customer service, people have questions for a business, and historically, that was mostly email, and phone, and mostly ticketing based. You'd file a ticket, a lot of do not reply email, and so on. And then, came along conversational customer support, which is just basic messaging, like WhatsApp or iMessage, like I mentioned earlier. Now, there's bot first experiences and Fin is an AI chatbot, AI first, chatbot first. So the first line of defense for a customer support team is Finn, not a person. And so, it fundamentally changes. The results we've seen with Fin are mind blowing. Our biggest challenge is actually trying to help customer support teams think about organizational change.

(00:26:05):
The tech is way ahead. It's actually people wrapping their heads around what this means for the role, the teams, loads of cool stuff, like new types of jobs for people, like conversation designers, a job we have where you design the conversations that Fin does or managers. So anyway, that's what Fin is. Fin has expanded. So, Fin is now also in our Intercom inbox. They've placed a people answer queries, customers support queries, and now Fin's in there too, helping the support reps. Suggesting answers for them to use, or helping them rephrase things. So, it's now augmenting people as well as answering questions by itself.

Lenny (00:26:46):
I think you're one of the few companies that has pivoted fully into AI. And, I think there's a lot of lessons here about how team structures might change, product strategy, priorities, things like that. So I'm curious just to unpack a couple more things here. First of all, what impact have you seen after going all in and going in this direction?

Paul Adams (00:27:05):
It's very early, honestly, to be able to answer that properly. And it depends what you measure as success. So, again, there's a lot of hype and buzz with AI. So, if you're measuring it by interest, it's a huge success. Our target customer is customer support. Our customer support manager leader. And so, they're very curious. They're like, "Does it actually work?" Again, back to the earlier thing of there's so much hype, there's a bit of skepticism around it. "Does it actually work? Is it as good as a person?" And in customer support, people who tend to work in that role are typically very high empathy, care a lot about people. And so, they're like, "But is it as good as a person? Is it nice, friendly? Does it understand humanity?" And so, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of interests, and a lot of people trying it.

(00:27:57):
We have some customers who are hugely successful with it. They can answer up to 50, 60, 70% of their inbound questions with Fin. So we've some customers who see huge success. But it's early. And so, has it transformed our business financially? Not yet. I think, all fast-growing startups... If you think of AI Intercom as, I guess, a new startup, even though we're 900 people, the growth curve, you're looking for this exponential curve, as opposed to big public company linear growth curve. With the exponential one, it takes a while. The first year or two years is the bottom of that. And so, I think we're still in the trying to figure out exactly what's going on, trying to talk to educate people. But, we have enough evidence to believe it's the future for sure.

Lenny (00:28:53):
Are there any examples of either this product or other instances of AI just blowing your mind where you're just like, "Wow, I never imagined it would be this good"?

Paul Adams (00:29:02):
I go back to that before after thing. So, the first version of ChatGPT was a before, after, where we we've been working, like I said, in this space, we've had a machine learning team for a long time. The way our machine learning thing worked before ChatGPT was that there was not a manual setup. A customer support manager would have to orchestrate the bot, and teach it what to say, and just a lot of orchestration, a lot of teaching it. And then, ChatGPT showed up and it's like, "Oh, it can do it by itself." It gets it wrong sometimes. So, do people get the question wrong too? It's as good as a person nearly for a lot of these basic things. So that blew my mind. And then, that was, "Oh, it can answer questions." But then, you're like, it can reason.

(00:29:45):
There's actually a debate about whether is this reasoning or deduction. But, it can work things out. And, I'm not one for going down into these really philosophical things. I'm like, "We just need to build. Let's go back, build the product." Or whatever. But it can work things out. And that blew my mind. And, we fed ChatGPT and other companies too, we played with other LLMs, like Entropik and so on, it can work things out. And that was mind-blowing. Then you can see it doing things, like writing code. And I was like, "Wow, it's really good at writing code. What does that mean?" And then, you start thinking, here at Intercom we have a one to five ratio. So a PM has about five engineers on a team. And you're looking at this thing writing code and you're like, "What happens next? Do we need as many engineers or will their role change? And they'll start doing different types of things like reviewing code instead of writing code?"

(00:30:41):
So that blew my mind. And then, the visual stuff, like I mentioned earlier, I think the visual thing was bigger than the original one. It can parse imagery, and it can help you see the world. You take a photo of your bike and say, "Hey, what's wrong?" And It'll tell you what's wrong, how to fix it. You can be traveling, take photos of stuff. It's in a different language. It's etched in stone on a 12th century cathedral. You're like, "What does that say?" And it'll tell you what it says. It's just like how to do that. This is what I'm actually repeating most to people these days, here in Ireland, if you want to be a radiologist, so study X-rays and tell people what's wrong, and so on, and forth, it's seven years training to learn that skill. So, seven years to be a radiologist, and then you're just into the job. AI, it seems it's already better at it. So, it's already better at it, and it can ingest every X-ray ever made. No human can ever read, and think about, and synthesize every X-ray ever made.

(00:31:45):
So, of course it's better. And then, you're like, "Okay, what happens now?" I guess, the whole job changes. Radiologists will not take x-ray. Well, I guess they might take them. But, they won't analyze them, for sure. They'll look at what AI says, check that it's right, and then it's bedside manner time. Tell the patient, maybe tell them what course. So the job just fundamentally changes. And by the way, that could be amazing. Here in Ireland, we have long queues for hospitals, epic waiting lists for people getting X-rays. So, this is a really good thing possibly for people. Here's the craziest one I have. AI can listen to your voice and copy it, so it can say things and it sounds exactly like you and it's really, really good. Almost in distinguishable. You're like, "That sounds like Paul." And so, I mentioned the Metaverse earlier. I don't know if you saw Zuck talks to Lex [inaudible 00:32:35]. See that?

Lenny (00:32:35):
Yep.

Paul Adams (00:32:35):
So that was my first, "Oh." For people who haven't seen it, they met in the Metaverse, I think, or some virtual world.

Lenny (00:32:42):
It was a black room.

Paul Adams (00:32:44):
In a black room. Yeah. And, the tech has come on so they can analyze your face and build a 3D model. It's really good, really, really close. So, you can imagine, that's going to get better. Based on the trajectory of that technology, it's going to get better. And so, the voice thing and the face thing means both of those things are almost indistinguishable from a real person. And, AI will be able to ingest all the things people say and do. And, when people die, it'll be able to replicate that person. And so, there's an afterlife, hey, your parent dies and you can still talk to them. And, that could be the weirdest thing. Maybe it's not good for people. I don't know. But, that tech is just around the corner. And the AI can answer your questions, mind-blowing. It's mind-blowing.

Lenny (00:33:35):
There's actually a Black Mirror episode with that same premise, where-

Paul Adams (00:33:38):
That's right.

Lenny (00:33:39):
... Yeah. And I don't think it ended well.

Paul Adams (00:33:41):
No.

Lenny (00:33:43):
Be careful.

Paul Adams (00:33:44):
For sure. For sure. Yeah, I think, the [inaudible 00:33:48] and the voice translation thing is another one. I can't remember. Maybe it's in Mission Impossible, where it can take a voice, translate it, and translate it in real-time. And this tech is, again, just here, where if I was a native Spanish speaker and couldn't speak English, you and I could still have this podcast. Your voice would be translated in Spanish in real-time for me. It's, again, mind-blowing.

Lenny (00:34:10):
We're actually working on dubbing/translating podcast episodes, which is all done through AI, where it figures out what you're saying, makes it Spanish, and then also changes your lips to match. And, we're trying to launch a couple of those. And that's actually very AI-based. Yeah.

Paul Adams (00:34:25):
That's cool. That's really cool.

Lenny (00:34:27):
You mentioned that your ENG team might change your thinking, because AI can make them much more efficient and work differently. I'm curious what you've seen actually change on your team, either using AI-ish tools, or just building AI products. What do you think is most different? And I'm curious from the perspective of a team that's trying to think about integrating AI and starting to lean into AI, what have you seen most change and should change?

Paul Adams (00:34:52):
Ultimately, you need really great machine learning engineers. That's where it starts. And if you don't have that, then you're going to find it hard to build truly, really, truly great things. So, what OpenAI provide, and what Entropik provide, and Claude, they provide an amazing technology, but you got to build on top of it. If you really want something brilliant, you got to build on top of it. So, we adapted what they build for customer support. Maybe someday we need to go build our own LLM that's just for customer support. Maybe. I don't know where that will all go. And maybe everyone will have their own LLM for every single business. I don't really know, to be honest. Maybe these companies will provide specialized LLMs. But anyway, that's the first thing. And, of course, these people are in high demand. So, you need to invest in building out that function, I think. Really invest in building out the function.

(00:35:46):
So that's what we've been doing. Our ML team's way bigger than it was and way bigger than it ever has been at Intercom. And then, it forks. So, some projects are very heavy on that ML team and it needs them. But other projects are more front end, like the inbox stuff I mentioned earlier, where we have Fin and Fin is working, we've built the underlying technology. Now it's a question of if you have a human support person answering questions in the inbox, that's a natural chat conversational interface, pretty straightforward. What happens when there's now an AI assistant in there? How do they talk? And what do they do? And when do they interject? And how do you represent that in the user experience that feels natural? So that's a really hard design problem.

(00:36:32):
So, saying back into like, okay, we've a product team that's a product manager, a product designer, maybe three, four, maybe five engineers, and they're getting help from the machine learning team. So, we now have both setups. And increasingly, we can do more with the latter, more teams who can build on the foundational technology that we've been building over the last 12 months or so. So that's one thing. I think a second thing that comes to mind is not to think about it as bolted on. I think some people are still in that camp.

(00:37:08):
Again, I'll go back to the mobile thing. There's just so many direct parallels with it. Like I said earlier, at Google, I worked in the mobile apps team. I worked on mobile Gmail, mobile docs, and it was the mobile team. And we were in London. We're like, "Hey, we're the mobile team in London." And meanwhile, over in Mountainview in California, no one cared. It's was like, "You're 20 people. We're 200. No one uses this stuff on a phone." And again, a lot of skepticism. "No one's going to write docs on the phone. Seriously? They're going to write a full document on a phone, are you crazy?" So, don't do that. We're trying not to do that. Don't bolt it on. Don't be like, "Oh, we'll have a bunch of AI people..." And we do have some specialists. But generally speaking, we're trying to have everyone learn about it.

Lenny (00:37:57):
Interesting. So, I'm curious just specifically what that looks like, don't bolt it on. The idea there is don't just have a site team that's like, "They're the AI team. They're going to add AI to all this stuff." You're finding and lesson is integrated into every product team.

Paul Adams (00:38:10):
And we're still early there. We're still early. So, what we're trying not to do is have the AI inbox team, and they're the only people who work on AI features in the inbox. I think it's much better to have everyone learn about it. By the way, I'm a big believer in generalists, a big, big believer in... I guess, my background is jack of all trades master of none. That's probably how I describe myself. I've worked as a researcher, designer, PM. And so, I believe in generalists, and so I believe in setting teams up that way. And, yes, specialists matters at times. Machine learning for sure is a deep specialism. And in Intercom, we generally, in engineering too, much prefer people who learn new things, whether it's a new coding language, or framework, or how to design AI interfaces, or whatever, get more people being able to do it.

Lenny (00:39:05):
I feel like, again, your company is a little bit of living in the future, where a lot of companies are going to get to once they realize, "Oh shit. We really need to get big here." Or they're already working on it. I'm curious if there's other maybe pitfalls you ran into that you think people should try to avoid and something you could share there, or just any other lessons about making this transition that you think might be useful to other people.

Paul Adams (00:39:27):
Yeah, what I've mentioned so far, don't bolt it on. Stay up-to-date. I mentioned earlier, read, read. I feel like I'm behind all the time. It's moving so fast.

Lenny (00:39:36):
What are you reading? What do you find is most interesting and informative for reading about what's happening in AI?

Paul Adams (00:39:42):
I'd love to tell you that it's incredibly structured. I have a great reading list that I got to read every Sunday morning. It's pretty random. I'm on Twitter, which is now called X, of course, a lot. I follow some people on Twitter. I actually use the recommended feed in Twitter a lot. I think, because I interact and look at a lot of AI, I get to see a lot more. So I do that and I do it deliberately to try and generate more stuff. I'll search Twitter as well. There's loads of cool stuff there. There's some newsletters as well and some people I follow.

Lenny (00:40:12):
Any newsletters you could call out that you think are most interesting?

Paul Adams (00:40:16):
Yeah, Matt Rickard is one guy who talks a lot about AI. The blogs of companies too. OpenAI have a pretty good blog, and they write papers, and summarize them.

Lenny (00:40:27):
Cool. If there's any other ones you think of, either people on Twitter to follow or newsletters, email me after, and then we'll add them to the show notes.

Paul Adams (00:40:34):
Yeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah, there definitely is. I'll dig them out. Your question earlier, how do you do it? You just try. Try book out half an hour and just go deep for half an hour, and then bookmark a few things, come back to them. Like everyone, you could be so busy, so many distractions, you just got to have to set aside time.

Lenny (00:40:50):
Are there any other tools or apps that you find really helpful? Sounds like ChatGPT is at the center of how you play around with it. Is there anything else that you find really interesting?

Paul Adams (00:40:59):
I'll try other things like Bard. For example, Bard is Google's AI search engine. Rewind is another fascinating company. I think it's rewind.ai. Rewind is basically augmented AI for your memory. So, install it on your local machine, and it captures everything, and remembers everything. It's all local, so there's no privacy issues. And, you got to try these things to understand whether it's any good, or useful, or where's the boundaries, and how does it work, and so on. So, I'm a believer in that type of thing.

When you started rolling out AI and leaning into this direction, did you run into any big challenges or hurdles organizationally, or personal interests, or opinions? I don't know. Is there anything you ran into that was a big stumbling block and something you had to get over?

Paul Adams (00:43:00):
Yeah, Intercom is full of diverse opinions about things. And, I think with AI, I'm all in. I'm leaning forward. The media is coming. I'm sold. I'm way past that point. Also, no one knows. No one knows. And so, a lot of the time, when we talk internally, the strong buy-in from Eoghan, our co-founder and CEO, Des co-founder, like me, like a lot of the senior leadership team we're in all in camp. And so, that helps a lot. Of course, if you're senior leadership team in the company are all in, of course, then it trickles down. But equally, some of the hurdles have been like, "Why are you all in?" And I'm like, "An educated guess. A hunch."

(00:43:51):
The part of business strategy and product strategy that, it's just hard. It's like taste. People talk about product taste, "Who has product taste?" And a lot of it is, it's judgment based on experience. That's all I can say. I don't know. For me, personally, I don't know, I lived through the mobile thing pretty closely, having worked at Google on mobile. I lived through that phase. So, I can see the same type of thing happening now with bigger. So I'm using that experience to go all in.

(00:44:23):
But it's a challenge for some people, because they don't have that context, or they disagree with it. We have a lot of debate here about the future. Fergal, I mentioned earlier, gave myself and a few other product leaders and Des he gave us a... I don't know, is it a pitch or what? A play? I don't know, about how maybe all of our roadmap with AI is wrong. I don't know if you are familiar with the Horizons framework of Horizon 1, 2, and 3.

Lenny (00:44:54):
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Amazon.

Paul Adams (00:44:56):
Yeah. So, Horizon 1 is the medium short to medium term, next 12 months, 12 to 18 months. Horizon 2 being like, "Hey, what's happening?" Whatever, 18 to 36 months out. Or, I think, people use different timeframes, different Horizons. Anyway. We're in Horizon 1 land. We're like, "Yeah, and the next year we're going to do this." And he's like, "Yeah, but two years from now, if this path plays out, everything we're doing now is going to be irrelevant and useless." And you're like, "Oh, okay." And so, those discussions happen. And, the level of ambiguity is off the charts. So, a lot of the challenges have been navigating that ambiguity and helping people get the conviction I have without drying out voices of alternative voices and opinions, which are often valid too.

Lenny (00:45:53):
What does help people get that conviction? Is it just showing them examples of, "Here's something." "Wow, look at this thing. This is unreal." And, I think, partly what helps, I imagine, is the market you're in seems like such a clear opportunity for AI, feels like an easier pitch than maybe a lot of other markets.

Paul Adams (00:46:09):
Yeah, that's true. For sure. That's true. Yeah, showing people is definitely the easiest way. I think customer support is definitely... Like I said, [inaudible 00:46:20], number one, customer support. So you're like, "Okay, I guess we should adapt." Adapt or die is our mantra. Adapt or die. I think that there are other industries where they're on the same journey, it's just not as obvious. So for example, reporting software, Tableau or any reporting product, how do they work? Well, they're the typical read, write app, build dashboards, filtering, querying, hardcore querying, query database, get some numbers, show it in a UI. A lot of thought and care goes into how you present that data to people. The different types of charts that are appropriate help people make good decisions ultimately.

(00:47:04):
I think, again, this is hand wave, who knows. Maybe that's all done dead now. And, the reporting product of the future is just a box, and the box just goes to the database, and the box is just, "Who was our best salesman last year January? Okay. Who was our top performing representative in January? Lenny." The report product to the future might look like that. And so, project management tools is another one. There's a bunch of products that I think are just outside the most obvious customer support one. And yet, equally ripe for a newcomer to come with a completely different paradigm and potentially take over.

Lenny (00:47:45):
I like that this connects back to your very first point about trying to think about where AI integrates is. Think about what problem are you solving as a company. For example, Tableau, helping people visualize data. And then, the question is, can AI just do this for you? And in that case, oh, and maybe you can. And that gives you basically a whole strategy of like, "Okay, how do we actually do that with AI?"

Paul Adams (00:48:06):
Yeah. And, I don't know if the reporting thing will play out that way. But, if you're a Tableau type company, you've tons of designers who design dashboards, and filters, and querying type workflow. What do they do? The UI is the box. So, it's really hard to get into your head like, "We must..." If you have conviction that we must change really hard.

Lenny (00:48:33):
Maybe one last question here. For team members learning and starting to work within this realm, is there anything you find helpful to get them ramped up, other than the advice you've already shared, which is just read a lot of stuff, watch Twitter/X, subscribe to these newsletters, and then just try it?

Paul Adams (00:48:49):
I also try and read things that say it's all a load of crap. So, it's very easy... I've been guilty of this many times. Back to the mistakes you've made. I've been guilty of this many times, where I've jumped on a bandwagon and it was all wrong. And the older I get... The Web3 thing, I'm like, "I don't even know what Web3 is." Crypto, I never bought crypto. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But, I'm not a bandwagon jumper. But, maybe might've been when I was earlier. And I try these days to read the alternative opinion. People who are skeptical or think it's bad. A lot of people think this is terrible for humanity. This technology is going to eat us alive. So, I try and balance my optimism. I'm a delusively optimistic thinker, so I try and balance that with a negativity, I guess.

Lenny (00:49:50):
That's really good advice.

Paul Adams (00:49:51):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:49:52):
Is there anything else in this realm that you think might be useful to share before we shift to a different topic?

Paul Adams (00:49:58):
Oh, yeah. The other thing is, don't be afraid. I think people are a bit afraid of it. And, for example, if I started walking around our office here saying, "Hey, I think we need two engineers per team going forward." That's probably not really a good idea to do that. And I think in reality that's not going to be how it plays out. I just feel like there's loads of great studies over the years about how people don't end up losing jobs, the jobs get moved around. And also, for customer support, for example, it's a high attrition job. So, people saying, "Hey, everyone's going to lose their job. A bot's going to take over." It's like, maybe some of that will happen. But probably to attrition, as in someone quit and just didn't get back-filled. So, the doomsday scenarios that I don't think would play out as much. But, for sure, it's easy to be afraid of it. And, I think you have to lean into it.

Lenny (00:50:54):
I love that. Okay, I want to chat about frameworks. You have a lot of interesting frameworks you've put out there. So, maybe we do a rapid fire through a number of frameworks that you've worked with and find useful. And, you actually mentioned this before and after, which I hadn't heard about. What's the general idea to that concept?

Paul Adams (00:51:14):
Before, after is literally that simple, I think. We've a rebrand at the moment happening, and that'll be a before, after moment. We're redesigning our pricing. And then, the day that pricing goes live, that would be a before, after, because nothing's the same. And so, we need to go back out and talk to people again. I'm a big believer in talking. You got to talk to customers, it's the only way. You've got to talk, talk, talk, learn, learn, learn. Don't take with the safe face value, go deeper. And so, a lot of these before, after moments, once you've passed, yeah, into the after you got to start learning, "Were we right? Were we wrong? What happened? What do people think?"

Lenny (00:51:54):
Can you talk more about this pricing learning/mistake you shared? What do you think you did wrong? What happened there?

Paul Adams (00:52:00):
We had a principle called align price to value. By the way, I think, pricing is incredibly difficult. A lot of the design team who work in pricing here, I say to them, it's one of the hardest design problems I know. I think onboarding is another one. Onboarding people into a product is also. People are like, "Oh hey, you just design a few steps and it's pretty easy. People will follow the steps." Again, deceptively difficult to design great onboarding.

(00:52:30):
So, I think pricing is deceptively difficult. But we had a principle around allowing price to value. People should pay based on the amount of value they get in the product, easy to say and incredibly hard to do. Value is subjective. The price, for some person they get 10 units of value. I think that's about $5. Someone else is like, "I'd pay $5,000 for those 10 units of value." So, the biggest mistake was a lot of mistakes compounded. And, this is an area where I think we were risk averse. We've ended up with too many pricing models. We've built on top of old competitive mistakes. And, it took a brave decision to say, "We're going to start again."

Lenny (00:53:18):
Wow, this feels like it could be a solo episode, just talking through your pricing lessons and journey. Maybe just is there a nugget of wisdom you could share for someone that's trying to think about pricing right now based on your experience?

Paul Adams (00:53:31):
Number one thing I would say is keep it simple. Keep it simple. It's so tempting to... With us, for example, a lot of SaaS products have add-ons, where you're like, "Hey, we built X and that's 10 bucks." Or 100,000, depends on what product you're selling. "We built X and that's the price of X. Hey, we've just built Y. Y is awesome and it's a new thing you can do, and it unlocks all these new capabilities. People shouldn't get that for free, because it's a new thing that didn't have. So let's charge more for Y, but that doesn't really work with the other... Okay, let's look at an add-on. Oh yeah, cool. People just add on." But then, later, now you've got people who have the add-on, and people who don't, and then you're like, "Add another thing." And so, we've added tiers, with products, tears, add-ons, tearing in the add-on. Oh my god. People can't understand their bill. So, my advice is keep it simple. Fight so hard to resist the temptation to add extra ways in which you price.

Lenny (00:54:43):
Amazing. I didn't think about going into this topic, but I'm glad that we touched on it.

Paul Adams (00:54:49):
Think I was talking about scars for life earlier. That's another scar for life.

Lenny (00:54:54):
All right. Let's keep talking about some frameworks. Another that I found that I loved is something that you call differentiation versus table stakes. What's that about?

Paul Adams (00:55:03):
It's like the Kano model, if you're familiar with that. But, it's very simple. I guess, we took the Kano model and just tried to make this really crazy simple version of it. Again, I'm a little bit allergic to things like this. I even hate myself for bringing up the Kano model. I'm allergic to people over intellectualizing frameworks. And like, "Oh, well if you've seen the new different law..." Of whatever. I'm like, "Keep things simple, practical, and pragmatic. And then, let's all, again, go back to work and start building the product, so that customers can benefit, because that's actually all that matters." And so, difference versus table stakes, very simple. I think people who adopt a product, or buy a product, or switch to a product, there's two driving forces. One is the attraction of the new solution, and that's basically differentiation. So what's different and better? But critically, what's different and better in ways that customers care about?

(00:56:00):
Again, back to all the failed projects, my lesson for a lot of these was, we were different and better in these Google projects in ways people didn't care about. All sorts of Google projects, like Google Wave was an amazingly innovative product that no one really cared about. So, be different and better in ways people care about. So that's the attraction that's like, "Oh, I want to check out that. That looks cool. I want to check that out. That looks better than what I have today." But, on the other side, there's a entry requirement or table stakes. To play the game, you got to have a certain amount of things. And so, they're table stake features. They're often very boring. They're real basic stuff, boring stuff, and easy to ignore, and easy to not build.

(00:56:44):
And again, a mistake with Intercom maybe over the years is that we were much more attracted to the differentiation and built a lot of that. So we went through different iterations of our roadmap, sometimes changing over the course of a year or two, where we were all the differentiation to realize that everyone loved it and really wanted to buy, but they couldn't, because we didn't have the basic report that they needed or we didn't have the basic permission feature that they needed. And then, the robot is built based on those... Trading off why do we need more differentiation or trading off why do we need to invest more table stakes? And so, these days, the basic Intercom today is we're 50/50 probably in terms of resources, but it has swung 70/30 in both directions at times.

(00:57:26):
The last piece about it is, I think it's really powerful to look at a roadmap or look at a proposed roadmap and ask yourself, which of these do things matters more to us, not to us actually to our customers right now? The other thing that we've talked a lot about here internally is if you're a startup and you're entering any established category, customer support for us, big established category, massive, a lot of table stakes, built up over years, decades. ServiceNow, Service Cloud, Salesforce, Zendesk, decades of table stake feature building. So to play the game, you need a lot of the table stakes, unless you have incredible differentiation. So from the early years of Intercom, people just buy us alongside Service Cloud or Zendesk. They just buy us alongside. They're like, "This Intercom thing..." We were like first modern messaging and modern UX. They were like, "We want that for our customers, alongside the big giant bag of table stakes." Because Intercom doesn't have any of those.

(00:58:26):
Then over the years, we've built the table stakes to a point where, okay, now we can fully play the game and people can switch, so they can swap Zendesk for Intercom. But it took us years to get there. And then hence, if you're a startup, you need to invest a lot more in differentiation. And then, over the years, I think you start to balance the books a bit.

Lenny (00:58:47):
I think what's interesting about this is one, it just gives you a way to think about looking at your roadmap. How much are we actually doing? And are we doing too much table stakes? Are we doing too much differentiation? So it gives you a awareness of what's happening. And I think, it's an interesting strategy as a startup like, "Do we spend years doing table stakes and then launch? Or is it go the way Intercom went, like differentiate first we'll build everything else later?" Wonder when it makes sense to go one or the other.

Paul Adams (00:59:13):
Yeah. And it probably depends on the market, different categories, and all sorts of things. Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:20):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay. The next framework is something that you call swinging the pendulum. What is that about?

Paul Adams (00:59:28):
I actually mentioned an example a bit earlier. Differentiation in table stakes was swinging the pendulum. So, swinging the pendulum means, you take a step back from everyday work life, and you make the observation that something's in an undesirable state. So, maybe it's, "Whoa, we've all the differentiation in the world, but people can't adopt the product, because we've never built any of these table stakes. It's undesirable." Or, "Oh, we've now built all these table stakes and we've not been investing in differentiation. And actually, we're not that attractive to people, because switching product is a pain. And we're not just attractive to people. Okay, so this undesirable state."

(01:00:08):
And then, so you go and fix it, but the temptation is that you over-correct. And we've done this so many times in so many domains, everything from, "Okay, we don't have enough differentiation." A year later, "Oh, wait a minute, we're missing all the table stakes. Okay, we're over there." So, product building is one, people is another one. Building out teams and people. Another big one was, I don't know, maybe five years into Intercom, we were on this high growth trajectory, really good classic startup before our pricing problems. And, we looked around and said, "None of us have done this before. I don't think that's good. Undesirable state. Do we even know what we're doing? We're just a bunch of random people. Do we know what we're doing? We need to hire some experts. We need to hire some experts. If we're going to go up market, we need market people who've done it before."

(01:01:07):
So, that was undesirable state, fix it by hiring people who've done it before. And then, we hired loads of people who've done it before, and what they did was brought the culture and ways of working of their prior company to Intercom. And so, we totally over-corrected, didn't work out in a lot of cases. In most cases, it didn't work out. Because, we weren't trying to be a bigger company, that already exists. We're trying to be us. So, I think, hiring and building teams is another where we really over-corrected to find out, "Okay, it's a balance here."

(01:01:43):
Related to hiring, one is generalists and specialists, similar theme. People who've done it before, or people who are specialized. And, we hired a bunch of specialists only to realize that they're not adaptable. And, in Intercom, we have a lot of ambiguity, and we lean into the ambiguity, and people who are highly specialized can thrive in big companies, really thrive. They're invaluable employees. But in a fluid startup-y culture with a lot of ambiguity, they can really drown, really struggle. Maybe the middle of this pendulum, landing in the middle is, "Let's hire someone who has done a bit of it and have a bit of specialism, not much, but enough to try and figure it out." So, we hire a lot of those people today.

Lenny (01:02:34):
First of all, I love all these stories of things that don't work out, because a lot of people don't like sharing these. And, this is what people want to hear, like, "Here's not everything was perfect. Here's a lot of mistakes that are made along the way." And, it feels like this framework is a result of just doing this too many times. Is the main lesson here generally avoid swinging the pendulum too far? Because sometimes, it's worth it, like in this case of AI, is like, "No, we're going all in." Or in mobile, it was worth going all in. I guess, yeah, what do you think of when I say that?

Paul Adams (01:03:04):
In talking to people about this before, sometimes the conclusion of the conversation is something like, it's the only way to do it. You actually can't do it a different way." And so, maybe the question is really, how high does the pendulum go? Versus, you got to swing it, and then it's like, how far do you swing it? And for sure, you're right. With AI, we are swinging it pretty high. Maybe I overestimated earlier, if AI is in the differentiation camp to mix the frameworks, we're still building a lot of table stakes features too, building depth into the product. And that's 50/50, I think I mentioned 50/50 earlier, so that's 50/50. So, we're not totally swinging it. It's swung, but we're also doing the other thing and balancing things out. So, I think you probably have to swing it. It reminds me to know where the boundary is, is what I was going to say.

(01:04:01):
It reminds me back to the olden days stories. I remember, at Google, privacy was really top of mind, to the point that it would block decisions, block product progress, just privacy circular conversations, so many circular conversations, and nothing ever got built or shipped. I worked on a project for a year at Google and we shipped nothing in the year, just circular conversations, which killed me at the time. So, when I went to Facebook, I realized they have a different approach to privacy. And again, I'm not advocating it's necessarily good, it certainly didn't help their brand. But, there was an idea that to know where the boundary is, you got to across it. And crossing it is painful. But, if you don't cross it, you'll never know. So if you think you're going up to the boundary and you stop before it, turns out it's actually miles over there.

(01:04:54):
So I think with a lot of this stuff, you don't really have a choice. You got to cross the boundary, feel the pain, be humble enough to realize you didn't get it right, and go again or whatever the corrective course is.

Lenny (01:05:12):
Yeah, get that pendulum off the even pivot thing that it's on. And then, let's fix that pendulum. Let's put it back.

Paul Adams (01:05:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:05:20):
Okay. Another framework that I read about briefly, and I love the general idea of it already, which is something that I think you call product market story fit.

Paul Adams (01:05:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:05:31):
What is that?

Paul Adams (01:05:33):
So yeah, with product market fit, pretty basic, well understood, very important. The way I describe product market fit is, you've got to build the right product for the right market. I think, by the way, as an aside, not enough people think about the market side of that equation. A lot of product people don't think about the market side. But for me, it's very simple. The market is the people, the problems they have, and how important the problems are to them. To have a good market, you need a lot of people with the same problem, and they need to care a lot about it. Going back to the Google social stuff, we found a lot of people with the same problem, but they didn't really care. They didn't really care. What they had was fine. So a lot of people with the same problem and a lot of energy around the problem and the product is the solution to that. The market's the who, the product's the what.

(01:06:21):
And, I don't know, in my career again, so a bunch of products that were built, there were good products in good markets, and they failed and I couldn't work it out. And eventually, I came back to this idea that... And maybe someone might say, "Paul, it's marketing. You're talking about marketing." But story, the story's wrong or the story's missing. And so, sometimes, it would be a great product in a great market explained in a convoluted way. I see that a lot. I used to see that a lot at Google again, just explained in a very complicated way over intellectualized. And, as a result, people are like, "What? What are you talking about?" You don't get their attention. And so, the story is really important, as important. And actually, sometimes you'll see not great products, certainly worse on paper... I'm trying to remember the Spotify competitor back in the day, people were like... What was the name of it?

Lenny (01:07:19):
Ordio?

Paul Adams (01:07:20):
Yeah, Ordio. Ordio was one of these where-

Lenny (01:07:20):
I like Ordio a lot.

Paul Adams (01:07:26):
... Yeah, all I've ever heard about Ordio was, "Amazing product."

Lenny (01:07:29):
Mm-hmm.

Paul Adams (01:07:30):
It's failed. And why did it fail? Spotify and Ordio had the same market. They were solving the same set of problems. Ordio was arguably the better product at the time. I don't know if that's true, but arguably the better. I also think Spotify's an incredible product. But, they got the story wrong. And so, again, I think, all product people, whether you're a designer, product manager, people in research, data science, need to think about the story all the time. Work of marketing, work of product marketing, and learn about how to explain the product, as much as how to build the product.

Lenny (01:08:03):
Mm-hmm. Makes me think about positioning and how important that is. And, we had April Dunford on the podcast very recently talking a lot about that.

Paul Adams (01:08:12):
Yeah. Yeah, she's excellent. Yeah, it is really, "Why are you better and can you explain why you're better?"

Lenny (01:08:21):
That's such an important point. A final area I wanted to touch on is jobs to be done. So we had the co-creator of Jobs to be Done on the podcast. We had Shyam Krishnan on the podcast. They very much disagree about how effective Jobs to be Done is. I know you guys are big on Jobs to be Done. So, what are your just general thoughts on the Jobs to be Done framework? How effective was it for you all? How do you use it? What do you find work? Doesn't work? Whatever comes up.

Paul Adams (01:08:47):
Yeah. I'll be totally honest, at the risk of finding people do this, we worked with Bob West years ago. I think Bob's a great guy. And we followed that model of Jobs to be Done more than the ODI, I think, is the other skill of thought. Anyway. I'll try say this in a simple way. We found Jobs to be Done really good. Very, very useful. But, in a very simple way... Again, back to this idea of simple frameworks, in a simple way, separately, there's so many people who spend so much of their energy debating the nuances and peculiarities of one version. Who cares? No one cares. Oh well, I don't care. They care obviously. But your customers don't care. People you're trying to build a product for don't care,. No one cares. That's a cool intellectual debate. But, for me, maybe this is too extreme. It doesn't really have any place in the work we do. We're just trying to build a great product.

(01:09:50):
And so, for us with Jobs to be Done, it was a really good way of us centering on the customer problem, focusing on not getting distracted, basing it in good solid research informed insight, that told us the thing people are trying to do. What is the thing people are trying to do? Again, energy. Do they have a lot of energy around it? Maybe the energy thing might've come from talking to Bob actually, now that I think about it. I think it did actually. I think, the idea of this idea that you need people who have a lot of energy around the problem. And you have to interview them for that most of the time to feel the energy they have. It's very easy to see if someone's apathetic versus into it.

(01:10:30):
So, we've had it pretty good. And, we invented this job stories thing by accident. I can't remember exactly what happened. But, I wrote out this way of writing a job story basically. Well, we didn't call it job stories, someone else called it that. We just, at the time, were like... I can't even remember. It was a trigger. And, anyway, we didn't even give it the thing a name, someone else named it, I think. And, I'm just like, "We're just trying to build a great product." So, we've had it really good in that way, really simple. And then, the other one that we use a lot still here is the four forces, which is this framework of Jobs to be Done. The four forces being... There's different forces when people try and switch product. And some of it's the differentiation, table stake stuff, like the attraction of the new solution, the reasons that you might not adopt it. Habits. People have anxieties.

(01:11:26):
Here's another funny story to tell you how much... The four forces is really good. Here's a funny story, I was saying earlier that Eoghan and Des were trying to convince me to leave Facebook, which I loved at the time, join and to come. They wrote out the four forces for me to join. And then, secretly, over a few beers, talked to me and fed me my anxieties. And basically worked me on the four forces. And I was like, "That is genius. That is ingenious. Maybe it's a bit... But it's ingenious." And so, the four forces is incredibly good at helping understand why people make decisions.

Lenny (01:12:07):
I love that a lot of your advice just continues to come back to, keep it simple, cut away anything that isn't necessary. And, I find the same exact thing with Jobs to be Done. I find it really useful as a framework for the podcast, the newsletter, but I think there's this endless set of processes and ways of optimizing that gets people distracted. And, often just slows everything down.

Paul Adams (01:12:28):
Yeah, yeah. And it's interesting and fun to talk about sometimes, really fascinating, unless you're an academic. But if you're working in a company that you're trying to build a software product for people to improve their lives in some small meaningful way, it doesn't matter. Just use the thing that helps you do that. That's the goal. And use the thing that helps you do that. And that's it.

Lenny (01:12:55):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Paul Adams (01:12:58):
I'm ready, yeah.

Lenny (01:13:00):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Paul Adams (01:13:04):
Yeah, the two books I recommend to everyone always, I have copies in my office here, It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be. It's a book by Paul Arden who worked in advertising a long time ago. It's an excellent book. It shows people that you feel an unlimited potential if you think about it the right way, everyone does. The second book I recommend to everyone and buy for people and give to them is Principles by Ray Dalio. I'm a big fan of Ray Dalio. I think he's incredible. I'm a big believer in principles. A lot of us at Intercom are... I always get those two books. And they're totally different. The Paul Arden book, you can read it in 20 minutes. Principles is that thick.

Lenny (01:13:38):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Paul Adams (01:13:42):
Most recent is The Bear, which I came to late. The reason I love the show is because I think it somewhat celebrates the grind. And I think that's important. I worked in coffee shops a lot when I was younger, when I put myself through college and stuff. And, the grind is part of life, and the grind is a necessity to get things done, and make great things happen sometimes. And I like that about it. I really like that about it.

Lenny (01:14:09):
What is a favorite interview question you'd like to ask candidates?

Paul Adams (01:14:13):
Yeah, I'll give you a slightly different answer. I don't really have certain few questions for candidates. And I don't like answer question diversity. I don't like questions that rely on memory. Like, "Tell me about the last time you did X." Here's an amazing question I got given recently by Alyssa who used to work here. I had to do referral calls. So, you're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job and they've got referees, and of course, the referees they have are the best people that they've ever worked with and their favorite managers. So this question is, "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer. And, it's incredibly enlightening.

Lenny (01:14:55):
And that's a question you ask on reference calls?

Paul Adams (01:14:57):
Yeah, on reference calls.

Lenny (01:14:58):
That is such a good question. I love it.

Paul Adams (01:15:00):
Yeah, it's a amazing question. Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:02):
All right, what a gem. Thank you for sharing that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Paul Adams (01:15:09):
This is maybe cheating, but I go back to a lot of the AI products. I think ChatGPT Vision is mind-blowing. I've been playing with Rewind lately. I was a bit late to it. Des, and Kiran, and a bunch of people here, founders of Intercom, love Rewind, use it and love it. Thing's amazing. So I'm a bit late to that. But, it's just augmented memory. It's mind-blowing. So, Rewind's been fun.

Lenny (01:15:32):
And they just came out with a little audio thing that can record your actual day.

Paul Adams (01:15:36):
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

Lenny (01:15:39):
Yeah, got some flack.

Paul Adams (01:15:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:43):
I'm not so sure. I don't know. I don't know if it's real. It looked like not a real product when they launched in, but I think it's real.

Paul Adams (01:15:47):
And it tippy-toes into what's okay and not okay with AI. And, yeah. Yeah, it's a cool theory though, for sure.

Lenny (01:15:57):
What is a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with people, find helpful for yourself?

Paul Adams (01:16:04):
Yeah, I have a post-it on my monitor that says, "Only work on what matters most." It's on my monitor, a post-it. And it sometimes falls off, and I have to write it again. Only work on what matters most. And, it's amazing. I go into work, someone emails me, and I'm like, "Oh, God." I'm like, "Only work on what matters most." The second one related is, stop worrying about things you can't control. And so, I have two of those. And so, only working what matters most. Stop worrying about things you can't control. It just reduces the temperature. Again, life lessons learned. I sent a lot of dumb emails in my past, like, "Red Energy, oh my God, what are they thinking?" You wake up in Dublin to a San Francisco email. And you're like, "Oh god. Keyboard." And, if your monitor says these two things, you just don't do that. You just take a breath, get a coffee, come back. Does it really matter?

Lenny (01:17:02):
Beautiful. The second one, I think, I learned first from Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Have you read that?

Paul Adams (01:17:02):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny (01:17:10):
Just think about the focus, the circle of things you can control, and then there's the circle of things you can influence, and then there's the things you have no control over. And, I find that really helpful myself. I love that you have it as a post-its. I feel like, I need to make post-its of all these lessons people share as their little mottos.

Paul Adams (01:17:26):
Yeah, the post-it on the monitor is a real life hack, I found a few years ago. Because it's dumb in a way. The posts on the monitor, it's in the way.

Lenny (01:17:34):
Wait, you actually put it on the monitor in the way of your screen?

Paul Adams (01:17:34):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (01:17:34):
Oh, wow.

Paul Adams (01:17:38):
It's in the bottom left, just covering the bottom. Because otherwise, if it wasn't there, I wouldn't look at. I make myself look at it.

Lenny (01:17:47):
Yeah. Wow. I haven't heard of people putting it over precious real estate on their monitor.

Paul Adams (01:17:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:17:53):
That works. What's the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?

Paul Adams (01:17:58):
The biggest one, again, so reductive and simple is to be nice to people. I think, being nice goes way further than people really realize. One thing that I've learned, again, the hard way through life is you have no idea what's going on in people's lives. You've no idea. People could have all sorts of really stressful, all sorts of personal stuff going on, and the reason they did the thing at work that you didn't like is because of that. And so, I try and think, "Be nice. You don't know what's going on. You might learn later. Don't act in a way you would regret." I think, being nice in life goes far further than most people give a credit for, because it's too much of a, I don't know, fluffy truism or whatever.

Lenny (01:18:54):
I 1000% resonate with that. I've been told I'm too nice and I had to become a little less nice. But, I still can't lose that. So I fully buy into that. My parents taught me a similar lesson.

Paul Adams (01:19:08):
Yeah. And sometimes it's hard. I'd never fired anyone before I joined Intercom, for example. I really did not like doing it. And, since then, I've done it quite a few times in a bunch of different circumstances, and realized it always works out for both sides. And the nicest thing to do is to do the harder thing. It's actually the nicer thing to do. People are relieved in this example. It's a nicer thing to do. So, it can be a complicated one.

Lenny (01:19:37):
I love it. Final question. You're Irish, you're based in Ireland. What is an Irish food you think people should definitely try out if they ever visit Ireland?

Paul Adams (01:19:50):
Can I cheat and say Guinness? Is that food?

Lenny (01:19:54):
Absolutely.

Paul Adams (01:19:56):
The Guinness in Ireland. People talk about this and it's true. The Guinness in Ireland is much, much better for a whole bunch of reasons. It's basically a fresh product and it's brewed here. It's the way they think about, it's like milk. Milk goes off, Guinness goes off. Guinness is older than a few days old, tends to start deteriorating. So, Guinness Ireland is amazing, because it's made here. The other thing I think that Ireland does really well is fish. Ireland has not had, by the way, the greatest reputation for culinary excellence over the years. I think Irish food in the States in particular is not good. But, the fish here is incredible. You can get incredible fish. And Ireland's obviously an island, so there's a lot of fish.

Lenny (01:20:37):
On the Guinness front, is there any way to get the good stuff not in Ireland? Or is that just you got to go?

Paul Adams (01:20:43):
No, there is actually. You just need to be near a brewery. So Guinness is brewed in Nigeria. There's a huge Guinness market in Nigeria.

Lenny (01:20:43):
I did not know that.

Paul Adams (01:20:53):
I think they actually use a different recipe, but it's brewed there. I think the brewery in the U.S. is somewhere in the east coast between New York and Eastern Canada. So, it's somewhere there. So, often, the Guinness in New York can be actually pretty good. The Guinness in San Francisco tends to be really bad. I remember talking to someone about this that works in Guinness. One of my friends, does a lot of work in Guinness. I think the boat carried the Guinness goes down through the Panama Canal back up to San Francisco. So, it's 12-weeks-old or something.

Lenny (01:21:25):
Wow. Did not think we would be learning about the travel path of Guinness from-

Paul Adams (01:21:31):
At least this is what I've heard. The Guinness has so many myths, you just don't really know what's true. But, these are the stories I've been told.

Lenny (01:21:38):
... Amazing. Paul, you are awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Paul Adams (01:21:46):
I have a handle, it's everywhere. Basically, P-A-D-D-A-Y. It's Paddy with an extra A. So, P-A-D-D-A-Y. That's everywhere. So, paddy@gmail, @Paddy. It's my handle everywhere. So, that's where you can find me. I'd love people to reach out to me, right, genuinely learn. I'd love to hear from people who think my AI talk is nonsense and it's more a crypto Web3. Or, I'd love to hear people who have alternative opinions and challenge mine. That's how I like to learn and get better. So, if people have those opinions, I'd love to hear them. I'd love to talk to them.

Lenny (01:22:25):
Be careful what you wish for. The YouTube comments are always a spicy place. We'll see what we see. Awesome, Paul. Thank you again so much for being here.

Paul Adams (01:22:33):
Yeah, thanks Lenny. I really appreciate it.
