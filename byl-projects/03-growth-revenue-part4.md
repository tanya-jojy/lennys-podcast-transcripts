## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Is performance marketing just something every company should be doing?

Timothy Davis (00:00:02):
Hot take, paid is for everyone. If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
When you take over for an agency at a company, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you find they are doing wrong?

Timothy Davis (00:00:20):
Instead of thinking about being on top of the page, and that's like ego marketing, I want to be number one. I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
Any other tips for people just to experiment with the platform?

Timothy Davis (00:00:33):
Each platform is different. The user behavior is different. Make sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. It's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Today, my guest is Timothy Davis. Timothy has led performance marketing for all of Shopify for the past two and a half years, and as a consultant has helped companies like Pinterest, LinkedIn, Redfin, and Eventbrite kickstart and scale the performance marketing teams. In our conversation, we get incredibly tactical on all things to performance marketing and paid growth, when to start investing, how to run signs of life tests on each platform, what platforms to investigate and what platforms to bet big on, what types of companies are best suited to invest big on paid growth whether you should invest pre-product market fit or not, what agencies often get wrong and what to look for in your investment when you're just getting started? Plus, what your first three hires should look like, tips for which platforms are most interesting right now, a peek at Timothy's actual reports that he runs to judge performance, if you're watching this on YouTube and so much more.

(00:01:37):

Timothy Davis (00:02:04):
Yeah, thanks for having me. A long time coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:06):
Yeah, I'm really excited we're finally doing this. I actually posted on Twitter for people to suggest questions for this topic and there's just so much interest in what we're going to be talking about, which essentially we're going to be diving deep into all things paid growth, all things performance marketing. By the way, I have a cold. For people, if in case you wonder why I sound a little weird, but the show must go on. I want to start with just setting a little context for folks that aren't super familiar with performance marketing and paid growth. When we talk about performance marketing/paid growth, first of all, are those two terms interchangeable to you? And second of all, what falls under the umbrella of performance marketing/paid growth?

Timothy Davis (00:02:42):
Paid can be a lot of things. It can be online, it can be offline, it can also even be affiliates. Typically, when I talk about performance marketing, it's about online only, but you could argue offline could be performing and affiliates could be performing and stuff like that. They can be interchangeable, but I would recommend if you are talking about it, to specify which one you're talking about. Because when you do say paid, because I'm in the industry, I would just, "Oh, they do Google Search and they do Meta and they do things like that." But if you do offline and you just say paid, we may be talking about things, but missing each other on two ships passing in the night. So I think historically, people, when they have said paid growth, have been fully focused on just online.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:43):
Just online. Okay. Got it.

Timothy Davis (00:03:31):
But I would argue in the last couple of years, you could definitely roll offline into that conversation as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:38):
Okay. So performance marketing, when someone hears that term, it's essentially marketing that you can measure the performance up.

Timothy Davis (00:03:43):
Correct. Yes, nail on the head.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:46):

I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:07):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:25):
Yes. So we just launched OneSchema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:47):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:58):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:18):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema. co.

(00:06:32):
Is performance marketing just something every company should be doing or is there certain business models where it's like, "No, you're probably going to grow through other channels mostly like SEO or sales or word of mouth.

Timothy Davis (00:06:42):
Hot take. I would say, paid is for everyone. If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google introducing AI, plus with paid taking up the first four spots, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now. You have to do promoted posts for people to even see your content. I would say it does depend on the industry you're in. If you're say, leaning heavily into influencer marketing, that is still a paid component. You may not be doing Meta ads, you may not be doing paid search, but that is a paid component. But I would say at baseline, everyone should be doing paid search. The way I usually explain it to people is paid search is user driven. You have to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show.

(00:07:36):
Anything else is more disruptive media. You're on Meta and you're looking at pictures of babies and cats, and then all of a sudden, you see an ad for Shopify. You're watching a YouTube video, maybe a YouTube podcast, and then in between, you get advertisements maybe for Shopify, maybe for Pinterest, maybe for Eventbrite. So all of that being disruptive media may not make a whole lot of sense for where you are as a business, but I would say paid search being user-driven, having to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show, should pretty much be for just about everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
Everyone should do it. Super interesting. There's also the most companies grow through one growth engine primarily, say word of mouth, or SEO, or sales or paid. So for some companies, paid will be most of how they grow like say, I always think of Booking.com and Credit Karma and just like most of their growth came from paid growth online, paid growth. For some companies, it's just like a layer, a small 10, 20% of their growth. What are signs that you have the potential for paid/performance marketing to be most of your growth, like say 70, 80%?

Timothy Davis (00:08:47):
I always say, where are your users? You will have some data that will allow you to understand that say right now, you're doing really well on TikTok. Some would argue that's an emerging channel right now. Great. If that's doing really well for you, maybe you take... Because that content could be used on something similar like Snap, see how that does for you. You could also lean into your Google Analytics or whatever analytics tool you are using and see if you're already getting users from that platform. If you're currently managing that, if you don't have a profile on there and obviously, you don't have a presence, it would be really hard for users to find you and get there. But always look at the data that's available to you within your analytics platforms and say, "Users are already finding us here. How can we turn that knob up to 11?" And you can do that with paid. Because if they're already finding you through that channel, what would happen if you were to just turn it up to 11?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
Is there an example of a company you worked with that's known that as an example of that, where you're like, "Oh, I see everyone's looking, finding them on Google. Let's go turn it to 11."

Timothy Davis (00:09:55):
Yeah. So there was a company I worked with a couple of years ago called, Hairstory and IPSY. I know, very funny. Guy with no hair working on a company called Hairstory, but they were doing really well from a Google shopping standpoint. But when I started consulting with them, we looked at the analytics and we actually saw that they were getting a lot of people from Meta and TikTok at the time. And TikTok was very, very new and they didn't really know what to do with it. So said, "We'll do a small test." We can start on Meta with just some customer testimonials. Let's see how that does. We'll get interest in, build a funnel, get retargeting, and hopefully get conversions. TikTok was so new at the time that it was like, "We don't know what's going to work. Let's just try with what is currently available."

(00:10:47):
Then once we started doing it, we started noticing, "Hey, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a creative standpoint." We were missing the mark of what we were using on Meta was working, was not working on TikTok. So you can't always just take what is currently working on one platform and apply it to another because it is a different user experience. It is a different mindset that the user has when they're on there. So that was an example of where we were able to take those instances, look at their data and say, "They're already finding us here. How can we turn this up a little bit?" And I don't remember the numbers exactly, but it was pretty exponential.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:24):
Okay. So the core advice here so far, is look for where people are coming to you from today, and then that gives you a sign of where you should start to think about running paid ads, performance marketing on those platforms.

Timothy Davis (00:11:38):
Yeah. And also, there's a saying that my current director likes to use, which is signs of life. You can always do a very, very small test. You can just put a little money into a platform, see if there's a sign of life. If there is, then you can pull back and say, "Okay, we have signs of life. Now let's build a campaign around that." There's no reason to say, "All right, we have a signs of life. Let's now turn it up all the way." Do we have the right creative? Do we have the right campaign? Do we have the right messaging for the users on this platform? Then let's take that approach, as opposed to just, "Hey, signs of life, great, go run a hundred miles an hour." Make sure you're doing the right thing when you get into those platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Let's follow that thread. A lot of people run little experiments on say, TikTok, and Snap, and Twitter, and things like LinkedIn, and they often don't see a lot of results and it's always like, "Hey, did we do it wrong or is it the platform's not working?" I know it's a very difficult question to give like, "Here's how you do a sign of life test correctly," But what are some things that you think either people do often wrong when they're trying to experiment with the platform or that you just think they should do when they're trying to look for signs of life?

Timothy Davis (00:12:49):
The number one thing I tell people all the time is use your own data, start with your own data. So take the existing customer base you have, load that up into the platform to build lookalikes. From there, you can do... And I'll use Meta as the example. You can do a 1%, all the way up to a 10%. So 1% match, 2%, 3%, so on and so forth.

(00:13:12):
What I tend to do is build ad sets, one at 1% because we know that one's going to be highly correlated to what we're looking for. Then a two to four, and then a five to seven, and then an eight plus. More times than not, the eight plus does not work, but there have been times where it has, so it's, "Hey, let's do it. Let's try it." But if you also have a very limited budget because some people don't have the luxury of having an unlimited budget like we do in some of these other companies I've worked at, just start with the 1%. See what that sign of life is because you already know that this is so tied to your existing customer base. If that sign of life is giving you a positive signal, now you have the information you need to build a campaign you need to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:02):
What are these percentages referring to? You may have mentioned it, but when you say 1%, 2%, 3%.

Timothy Davis (00:14:07):
Yeah, yeah. So that is how closely tied they are to that user's behavior on the platform. So they're 1% tied to what they're doing. They're visiting similar pages or they have similar behavior on the platform, so they're more than likely going to be tied to what that user... They're not going to be that user exactly, but they're going to be very correlated to them where 10% is pretty wide base that you're going to hit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:35):
I see. So the smaller the percentage, the closer they are, the closer it will look like there.

Timothy Davis (00:14:39):
Yep, there you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):
How do you know if it's the creative that is failing versus it's just never going to work? Is there something that tells you that's what's not working?

Timothy Davis (00:14:47):
It's a million-dollar question, to be honest with you. Because you could look at some of the metrics that currently exist in the platform. Click-through rate basically just tells you, are the users engaged? Because start with the target. You're getting the impressions are there. Is the target right? That should be your first thing. Yes, the target is correct. Users that we want to see are seeing our ads, but they're not engaging with it. That would be the first thing.

(00:15:15):
But the part that I think you're really trying to ask is creative versus the content. Because sometimes depending on the ad unit, you could have a story creative that is literally the creative has to stand on its own, not necessarily the content that's in it, but something like an in-feed creative has a headline, a primary, a description, and a creative. That's where honestly, the only way you're going to get an answer to that outside of the data that's available to you like click-through rate, reach, frequency and all those things to pull in more metrics, is a focus group to understand, "Hey, when you saw this image with this content, what was your result from it?"

(00:15:58):
Now, you can build a test within the platform to do a control versus a test where say, you take the creative with the same primary and the same description versus a creative that's just your logo with the headline and the description and see what the results are. But more times than not, you're not getting the understanding from the user of, well, why doesn't that creative resonate with you? And they'll give you suggestions in the focus group. Why does that work better for you than not? So that's a really, really hard question to answer without having those dialogue with the user to understand that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. How long do you recommend these tests run for these signs of life tests? And I like this term, by the way. I haven't heard this before.

Timothy Davis (00:16:40):
Ideally, in a perfect world, you're going to hear the word, statistical relevance. Mathematicians will tell you exactly what that number is. And I'm not going to pretend like a mathematician, but a lot of times, it's budget constraint. So there could be a VP finance. Anyone like that could just come to you and just say, "Hey, do you have $25,000 for this test?" You only have 5,000. Just get that information, get that data. You can then also build an off size off of that. Hey guys, we worked with our Meta partners, we worked with our Google partners. We put $1,000 behind this test. We know that our impression share was this, our reach was this. If we were to put $10,000 into it, this is the expected return we can get from it based on the click-through rate, the conversion rate that we got from the test that we ran.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:34):
Got it. So basically, we have limited number of dollars to spend. That'll tell you how long you could run one of these for.

Timothy Davis (00:17:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:42):
Any other tips for someone that's trying to experiment with a platform early on for these signs of life tests? So one is try a lookalike that is the most targeted version of the lookalike. So 1% you said, and then incrementally grown and incrementally increase that percentage as you spend more. Any other tips, I guess, for people just to experiment with the platform?

Timothy Davis (00:18:04):
Make sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. A lot of times, companies I've either consulted with or worked at, there was always pressure or there was always a need to succeed at whatever experiment we put into market. I believe in creating an environment where it's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning. And more times than not, if we put something new into a platform that we know nothing about, we're learning the bells and whistles, we're learning the functionality of it. Just know there's going to be things you're not going to understand because each platform is unique, each platform is different, the user behavior is different. So give yourself some grace, understand that this may not work. And as long as you're learning from it, you're going to be okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:56):
I love that. In terms of which platforms people should explore, obviously there's Google, there's Facebook, Instagram, what are the platforms people should seriously consider at this point?

Timothy Davis (00:19:09):
Google for sure. And when we say Google, let's make sure everyone understands what Google entails. Google is YouTube, Google is Google search, GDN, Google Display Network. There's a lot of things in Google that you can do. I always say, if you have the creative available, you should really, really be looking at doing video because video is one of those things that I'm very bullish on. It is doing really well when you measure it the right way. And as long as you can get that creative and get it consistently just because you have one piece of creative, if it's doing well, you do need to have that creative refresh, kind of that flywheel going. Make sure you're doing Google Search, again, user-driven, YouTube, and Meta, and Meta contains both Facebook and Instagram. And then based on the data available to you, if you do see users on TikTok, definitely go after those. But if you're just starting out and you just want to get your feet wet into something, I would say start with Google Search, then get into Meta. And if you have video available, definitely get into YouTube.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):
Awesome. Okay. So Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. What about LinkedIn? Do you see things happening there for say, B2B companies?

Timothy Davis (00:20:30):
Yeah. LinkedIn is very expensive in comparison. So just know if you're going into LinkedIn, it's going to look almost three times more expensive than other channels. The targeting that's available on LinkedIn, knowing job titles, industries, actually targeting people at certain companies is very powerful. The example I always tend to use is that I worked at a company called SoftLayer. SoftLayer was acquired by IBM because they were trying to build out their cloud portfolio, couldn't do it. So they're like, "Hey, let's do the next best thing and buy this company." But when we were just SoftLayer, we were trying to get Coca-Cola as one of our clients. And you know those Coke freestyles where you can pick whatever drink you want and put the flavor in it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:21):
No, that's awesome.

Timothy Davis (00:21:22):
Oh man, these are great. Maybe it's a cell thing, but basically, you go up to a Coke freestyle and say, "I want Dr. Pepper and I want cherry flavor in it." Or you want Coke Zero with cherry and vanilla in it, you can do that. It's the freestyle you get to pick. The reason they wanted it to be cloud-based is because there's a ton of drinks in there. So you need to be able to efficiently and effectively say, "This store needs more Sprite or this store needs more Sprite Zero." Because you have your whole portfolio in this one machine, so you want to be able to update things more readily. And it was between us, AWS and Microsoft. And met with the sales team and said, "What do we need to do to win this?" Because it was a big ticket item for us.

(00:22:14):
And what we found out was they had two concerns about us. It was recency and private security. So what we did was we found out where the decision makers were. So A, in LinkedIn, we took the anyone who works at Coca-Cola, we want you to see ads about security and recency. Outside of that, we also geo-fenced it because you would think Coca-Cola Atlanta, that's where the decision maker sits, but they were actually in LA. So in LA, we geo-fenced them, and we knew that they worked at Coca-Cola. The next time the salesperson got on the call with the team to say, "Hey, just wanted to check in." He was like, "Hey, hey, I get it. Security is fine. Recency is fine. We hear you." That was great to hear because it was something we were able to do on LinkedIn and we did it in other platforms as well. But we knew we were able to get not only to the decision maker, but everyone around that decision maker to say, "Hey, these guys may be the ones we need to go with."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):
Okay. So just to mirror back what you're saying, you're saying you ran ads on LinkedIn targeting the execs at Coca-Cola, trying to influence them to overcome these barriers they had to buying to working with you guys. Amazing. I've seen people do that on Google Search, but I've never heard of... It makes so much sense to do on LinkedIn and it worked. And did they know that you did this or they're just like, "Oh, I just changed my mind"?

Timothy Davis (00:23:42):
One of them was like, "We get it. We're seeing it everywhere." We actually tried because at the time, we didn't have an offline team. We actually tried to buy the billboards around the office as well, but I didn't know enough at the time from an offline perspective of the right people to talk to, how long it would take to do it. So we were trying to pour it on hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):
That's incredible. I could see why LinkedIn is more expensive. That's incredibly powerful. And is the advice then that LinkedIn makes more sense for higher LTV, higher CB type of products?

Timothy Davis (00:24:15):
Yeah, exactly. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn and my LinkedIn reps may kill me for this. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn until you've tested Google and Meta first. Now, you could be an enterprise level company and it does make sense to start with LinkedIn for sure, but depending on your audience, I would say more times than not, it would be a Google, Meta discussion before going to LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
Okay. So just generally, start with Google and Meta. Is there one or the other usually? I guess, yeah, which one would you start with if you had to pick one?

Timothy Davis (00:24:49):
Always Google Search. I'm always going to say, start with Google search, but it's also creative dependent. If you don't have the right creative for Facebook, it's going to be really hard to convert because users are just going to either be turned off by what you're putting out there. And then also, depending on where your user base is. If they're not on Facebook, it's kind of a moot point. But if they're browsing around on GDN or YouTube, it makes more sense to go there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):
And then you said this insight about video is performing super well right now and you're recommending people use video. And the key there is you need to be able to make videos, video ads.

Timothy Davis (00:25:25):
Yeah. You got to make sure you have that flywheel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):
And the flywheel is just people internally or some company agency that can make video ads for you?

Timothy Davis (00:25:32):
Correct. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:33):
Cool. I guess, is there any advice there of just how to do that or what ads work well or anything there for someone else-

Timothy Davis (00:25:39):
So yeah. The thing with YouTube is I always say, start with emotion. If you can have an emotional connection with the user, is going to be way more impactful and way more powerful than anything else. And to take that further, when I say emotion, I'm talking about comedy, I'm talking about...

Timothy Davis (00:26:00):
I'm talking about happiness. It's not necessarily just, "Oh, we need an emotional connection with the brand." It is just making sure the user feels something after seeing your ad. Because then, they're more times not going to remember it, which then they will take a favorable action after the fact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
That is super interesting. One last question about platforms. Are there any other platforms you see working for people that are emerging maybe that people aren't thinking about, Reddit, or Snap, or X, or I don't know, anything along those lines?

Timothy Davis (00:26:34):
When you say emerging channels, my brain kind of goes to connected TV, podcast, VR, advertising, audio/voice search, and even AI stuff right now. I can tell you podcasts are doing really well for the people that I know are able to measure it correctly. Connected TV is also doing really well. You can take the, again, you're doing YouTube right now, being able to take that creative and repurpose it. But the VR stuff and the AI stuff, that is stuff that is, I would say, very emerging right now. Because to be completely transparent, I haven't experimented with those things yet. I kind of like letting other people be the guinea pig and learning from them, and then if someone comes to me and they're like, "Hey, we have budget for this, let's go ahead and test it." "Great. Let's go. Let's see what we can learn."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:34):
Awesome. Podcast ads. I'm glad you suggested that. I'm a huge fan. Thank you. They're working really well for a lot of our sponsors and I'm very biased, so you don't need to pay attention to me. But I also think there's a lot of opportunity there. Okay. Let's talk about when to start investing in performance marketing/paid growth. So, say, you're a startup, do you have any advice for when it's time to start, signs of life test or even... And then also, just when is it time to scale to go like, "Okay, let's go big on this."

Timothy Davis (00:28:08):
If you are a startup, typically, whenever I consulted with them, it was what are the goals, what are we trying to achieve, and when? Because if you're looking for something quick, paid needs to start immediate. And paid [inaudible 00:28:24] started yesterday because SEO takes time. SEO, depending on the market you're getting into, if it's emerging, people may not even know your product exists. There was a product I was working on years ago that if you were traveling to a hotel, and say, it was a romantic getaway with you and your partner. And you wanted the hotel suite or room done up with flower petals, and champagne, and stuff like that, they would do it for you. Well, they were working with someone before that was like, "Oh, we should totally be in paid search." And if you look at the keywords that they were doing, it was like, booking hotel rooms. It's like, "No, that's complete disconnect." And they're like, "Yeah, but we're trying to build awareness."

(00:29:08):
You don't want to build awareness through search. You build awareness through display media-based type media. When we transitioned all of their money over at the time, and this will age me, before Meta was a thing, when we transitioned everything over to GDN, that's when the company started really reaping the rewards. Because we were building the awareness around the product. So, it depends on what is the demand of your product and market. If you're doing something that is similar to another product and market, you could do competitor, I call it coattail riding. Say, Lenny, you and I create a product that is similar to monday.com. We can go out there and just start bidding on monday.com and say, "See why Lenny and Tim are better than monday.com." And start getting some people in interested, maybe kicking the tires, starting free trials, but they also have other keywords that they can go after in market. But if you're going after something new like hotel room, flowers, and I forget what keywords we were bidding on for that, it was years ago. People weren't thinking of that. It wasn't something they were searching for. So, it just really depends on, A, when do you expect results because SEO can take time. And B, what is the demand in the market for your product?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:33):
Some people use paid ads to drive early growth to bring customers, to help them figure out what to build kind of pre-product market fit growth. Is that something you recommend? Is that something you'd advise against? Is that strategy that you've seen work?

Timothy Davis (00:30:48):
Yeah. Product market fit is a huge thing. We've run into some of this at Shopify, and we definitely ran into this at IBM. So, for the longest time, IBM is, "We're a global company, we should be everywhere." But when we started looking at the data, it was, "Should we be everywhere?" For example, Africa, we were in the whole continent. We weren't just in, say, South Africa, or Egypt, or something like that. And the more we dug into it, the more we realized the biggest issue wasn't necessarily that users weren't interested in our product and weren't purchasing it, it was because we didn't have a product market fit mainly from an operation standpoint.

(00:31:33):
In Africa, there are multitudes of different types of currency. There's the franc, there's the rand, there's the shill, and we were just, "Hey, USD, thank you." So, of course, they weren't converting unless they were going out of their way to make a way to convert that. So, when we took a step back and we said, "Okay, where do we want to start?" It was South Africa. That's really where we were trying to get, quote, unquote, "stronghold" in, so we had to make sure we had the rand available. Once we did that, we started doing tremendously better because we had a product market fit. They had demand for our product, and now we were able to serve them, meet them where they were.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
So essentially, you're saying probably not smart to run a bunch of ads if it's not working, if you don't have something people actually want yet in that market?

Timothy Davis (00:32:28):
Right. Or able to convert.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:31):
Because conversion is going to end up being really low, no one actually cares about what you're doing.

Timothy Davis (00:32:35):
All you're going to do is really annoy the users. Because, say, in the future they are, "Hey, I'm still interested, but I don't want to use that product because I already tried." It's like, "No, no, you can totally use it now." "I already tried. I had a bad experience with them." And some users will hold you accountable to that. One bad experience and I'm just never giving you my business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):
Interesting. So, is that generally your advice if you're startup, you're not feeling like you actually have product market fit yet, should you even experiment with and do signs of life tests, or should you hold off until it's like, "Okay, it's actually working, let's go."

Timothy Davis (00:33:10):
From an operation standpoint, I always want to make sure those things are tied off. Yeah, it doesn't make sense to, again, if you have a major budget and you're trying to get awareness into a market, great, yeah, you can go after a market. But just know that it's probably not going to convert very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:28):
Got it. So-

Timothy Davis (00:33:29):
I wouldn't recommend it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:31):
Okay, great. Awesome. Very clear answer. Let's talk about the mistakes that you see companies make when they're investing in performance marketing. We got introduced through Casey Winters's illustrious former podcast guest, two-time podcast guest and asked them about you. And he told me that when you take over for an agency at a company that you've worked with, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you see and find they are doing wrong that allows you to be such a hero when you come in and take over.

Timothy Davis (00:34:03):
I think agencies have playbooks. Now I've worked at agencies, I did consulting for a long period of time and it was never an approach I took. I looked at each account and each company as its own thing. But I think a lot of agencies just come in and they go, "Oh, this is like AB&C company. And this is what we're doing. Copy, paste, done, move on." And they're also not willing to get deep, deep, deep into the weeds of stuff. I may get a little too far into data than some other people. For example, I have ops cadence that myself and my team follow. So, within that ops cadence, we have things like finance, performance, structure, keywords, ad copy, quality score, targeting, et cetera, et cetera. And then, within each of those we have specifics. For example, the keyword subsection is keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negative, so on so forth.

(00:35:06):
I feel like agencies don't necessarily get into all of those things every single month where some of those we're doing weekly, some of those we're doing biweekly, and some of those we're doing monthly. But they touch the things that they think they need to touch. They turn on automated bidding, they're doing their search query reports, and then they just kind of move on with their day because they have 50 other clients they have to get to. Well, what about looking at your conversions? Where are we converting? Have we tested different landing pages? What is a better user experience that we could be getting users right now? It's a five-step process, can we get it to a three? Partnering with PMMs to say, "Hey, here's something that I think could help improve our lead to conversion." Just stuff like that, that they're too busy with too many other things to focus really, really deep into those.

(00:36:03):
And typically, whenever I managed an agency in the past and I consulted, I made sure that you weren't stretched thin enough that you couldn't do those things. Because I'm a firm believer in hiring smart people and then getting out of their way. But each week having one-on-ones with them, just spot checking things, just saying, "Hey, I looked at this. This doesn't look right. What's going on there?" "Oh yeah, I do that on this day." "Okay, great. Just making sure you're covered." Because sometimes people won't scream uncle when they should be screaming uncle because they think it's a sign of weakness.

(00:36:40):
But let me know when you're overwhelmed. Maybe I have a solution for you. Maybe there's a way I can coach you to be better at something, or we just need to hire more resources. Because the client portfolio you have is five, and when we took them on, they were all at 100K, but now they're all spending 2 million plus. We need to offload some of that from you because you're doing such a good job that you've scaled them up. Let's give you three clients instead of five and hire someone to take those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):
So it sounds like basically they just don't have the time to care and spend on all the things that they need to be doing. And when you've held companies, you actually go deep and you have the time to do it well. I guess, when someone's trying to find an agency or someone like you, I know you don't do this much anymore. Any advice for just how to know if they're going to be great? Is it just agencies in general probably not a good choice? Is it hire someone in-house? I guess, what advice do you offer people that are like, "Oh man, I want to avoid this."

Timothy Davis (00:37:43):
Agencies are a good place to get things started. Even when I was consulting, I would, honestly, I'm a big believer in forward thinking, backwards planning. So, if I'm taking this contract on with this new client, what's the end goal for you? If your end goal is to have this at performing in $100 million spend, there's no way one person can do that. So let's create milestones along the way of making sure we're checking in and saying, when is the right time to hire? Whether that's a data scientist, whether that's a creative person in-house or replacing me full time. There's no reason that you should be holding a company back. If anything, you should be helping them get to that milestone. And I think that's why I've been able to do so well for myself because I show that, "Hey, I have the best interest for you and your company." As opposed to how much more money can I squeeze from you by holding onto you as a client.

(00:38:47):
I would say, agency consultant is a good way to start. Because if you as a business owner, you shouldn't have to log into, "Oh, I haven't logged into Google in three weeks to look at stuff because I'm doing payroll, I'm doing HR stuff, and I'm meeting with clients, and I'm doing sales." Start there, get it to a good place. Create that milestone of, "Hey, when we're spending 50K a month, I need to hire somebody full time to take this over." And just have that conversation with your agency and your consultant. I think more times than not, you will have a positive reaction to that. But if you don't, I would say that's a major red flag and probably someone you shouldn't be partnering with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):
Awesome. Okay, so your advice is to get started on paid growth, buying an agency or a small shop consultant type person to get you started, have a conversation. And when we reach a certain scale, we're going to hire someone internally to run this for us. And then, potentially, they'll keep working with you. Potentially they'll start things in their own. Or is the assumption they'll start working with you, they'll become the owner of this thing, or is it like we may transition you out?

Timothy Davis (00:39:52):
That's a really good point actually. So, there have been times where a client's like, "Hey, we've reached our milestone. I want to bring someone in." That person comes in, and say, they're an expert in social media, like, "Hey, I still want you to execute on Google and Bing, because that is just not my bailiwick. I'll take over the social stuff, but we do need to talk about your fee. Maybe it does need to go down." "Completely acceptable. Let's have that discussion, make sure we're both aligned to what that should be." But yeah, there have been times where they're like, "Hey, we've reached our milestone. We got to bring someone on." But that person that they bring on is like, "Actually, I see expansion in this direction, but I can't do this. Are you willing to stay on, and help me with this? Great. If not, I'll just have to find someone else who can."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:37):
I want to talk about the team that you build over time, but later. But specifically, for this first person that you hire, what sort of person is this person? Is it like a data person? Is it a person that's just done specific performance marketing on channel? Or what do you look for ideally?

Timothy Davis (00:40:55):
I'm a big believer in... There was a book written by Nate Silver called The Signal and the Noise. Are you familiar with it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):
No.

Timothy Davis (00:41:07):
So, Nate Silver is the guy who created.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):
FiveThirtySeven?

Timothy Davis (00:41:12):
Yeah, yeah. And in the book, he basically... I'm going to use the word art, I'm going to use the word art, detailed the art of probability statistics and applied him to real world circumstances. It included case studies with baseball, which of course I loved. Elections, climate change, poker, stuff like that. And I liked that book. It's kind of dense. But the thing I liked the most about it was the title. And just changing the title ever so slightly to signal not noise. So typically, whenever I hire people, I want to hire smart people and kind of get out of their way. But the biggest thing I want to focus on is what is your thought process when it comes to data?

(00:42:05):
Because I can teach anyone how to do Google ads. I can teach anyone how to do Meta ads. That is not the hard part. It is the data part that is the hard part because there is so much noise going on in those accounts. They give you everything, which is great. It's great that they give you all this information, but you can have someone that's "Oh, but look at the reach, look at the frequency, look at the CPMs, look at the CPC, look at the conversion rate. Look at the cost per lead. Look at the cost per MQL. Look at this." Hold on, that's a lot of noise you just said. So what is the signal and what is the noise? And let's make sure we're focusing on the right signal versus the right noise. And that has to be a data person because there's a lot of data in these platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:51):
\This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:43:43):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's get E-P-P-O .com/lenny.

(00:44:10):
Everyone I talked to that's worked with you is just like, "Timothy is incredible at working with tons of data and finding the things that matter." Someone told me that it actually comes from your love of baseball, that you just go crazy with stats and spreadsheets of baseball games, and players, and things like that. Is there something there that you could share that is interesting?

Timothy Davis (00:44:28):
Yeah. So I played baseball my whole life, but when you blow out your arm and you're as fast as a sea otter, it's not very conducive for you to continue chasing that dream. But the one thing I always liked was the stats. Even as a kid when I would watch baseball games on TV, it's like, what's this guy batting? How often is he getting on base? How many RBIs? Like, "Oh, this guy is terrible average, but he has a lot of RBIs, so that means if there's a runner on base, he may not get a hit, but he's going to get that guy in. So you want to make sure you put him in the right spot in the batting order, so on and so forth." I could talk about that for hours. But again, that could be another thing where there's a lot of data available, which one should you focus on?

(00:45:16):
And ultimately, what is the optimization you're going to make to the lineup or to where you place fielders on the field to ensure that we're doing the right thing and becoming as efficient and effective as possible? As far as dealing with all that data, that is just, I would say, a skill I've learned over time. Early in my career, whenever someone was like, "Oh, we have this new project. Who wants to work on it?" "I'll do it." I was always just eager like a sponge. I wanted to get in as much stuff as possible. I did SEO for a portion of my career. I did email marketing. I did affiliates. And then, eventually, I remember the first time I saw paid, because again, I was doing SEO where I was like, "Yeah, we're going to do this and we think it's going to work." But we won't know for about six months.

(00:46:12):
Someone showed me the paid platform. I was like, "Wait, you know this is the keyword you're bidding on. This is how many times the ad was shown, how many people clicked on it? How many... Wow, this is amazing. I need to get more into this." And that's just kind of where it started. And when I usually hire people and we go through the interview process, I make sure that they can be data focused. Really, it's just ensuring that we're focusing on that signal and not the noise. And one of the interview questions I usually ask is I throw a bunch of data points at them and then say, "Out of all that, what would you do to optimize the account?" And more times than not that they're just overwhelmed. But the people that I like are like, " Well, what's the purpose of the campaign?"

(00:47:02):
"The purpose of the campaign is to drive conversions." "Okay, well, I would focus here, focus on how many clicks we're getting, and how many conversions, are we targeting the right people?" Because who cares about how many impressions you're getting? Who cares about the reach? Who cares about the frequency? If the goal of the campaign is to get the conversions, that's what we should be doing. If it was awareness, it's how many people saw it. If it was a consideration, how many people were getting into the funnel and are considering us from a white paper download or a demo as the product solution that they're looking for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
That's a great segue to the next question I wanted to ask you, which is just metrics that you love to focus on, pay attention to when you're helping people with paid ads. A lot of people think about CAC, a lot of people think about return on ad spend, LTV to CAC. I know it really depends on the goals as you said, but I guess, is there anything that you find is like, forget these metrics, these are kind of the bucket that you focus on most?

Timothy Davis (00:48:01):
Yeah, so for those metrics, I would say, I really hope you have a great finance partner. Shout out to Courtney and Nick the fantastic finance partners I have at Shopify. Nick's not there anymore. Sad cry emoji. But Courtney, we're able to collaborate on those things. Understand, this is the investment we're putting in, this is the expected return, this is the CAC that we can basically put a guardrail on. You have to be within. So, hopefully you have a really strong financial partner you can use for those. But as far as the stuff that I focus on, there are things that whenever we're looking at accounts, we'll kind of hyperfocus on. For example, Google will give you information about what is going on with your ad copy and how to ultimately show as often as possible. What I'm showing here is a visual of brand versus non-brand when it comes to expected click-through rate, landing page experience, and ad relevance.

(00:49:08):
The reason I like building reports like this is because it'll kind of show you where your hole in the ship is. If you look on the left side expected click-through rate, 75% above average. Landing page experience, 84% above average. Then you get down to ad relevance, a lot more colors than there are green, only 35% above average. So, for your brand ad copy, the clear direction you have from the data that's available to you is jump into the account and make it more relevant. That will improve your ad strength. And once you improve your ad strength, that will improve your quality score. And more times than, I think, it's a 12% increase in the number of impressions you can get if you increase from a below average to an above average for the data that's available here. And then, on the non-brand side, clear expected click-through rate, you really need to be working on.

(00:50:13):
And that data is also available here that you can kind of see. I put in red the one for brand, your quality score being at a nine, but your average CPC is $8. That is very interesting. It should be, the higher your CPC is, the lower your CPC should be. So that is an investigation that's like, "Hey, here's a signal, let's go do a deep dive." So there's further reports that you could look at. Looking at the ad strength again, average, excellent, good, or poor. You can see clearly on the non-brand side doing really well. They're doing really well here. Most of their ads, 46 of their ads are excellent and a bulk of their spend is going there. But if we look on the brand side, you have one ad, one ad that you could go in and just click pause on, that is a poor. And look at that CPC $7.

(00:51:19):
So just turning that ad off by itself, not only will... I'm a firm believer in that there's an account level quality score, not just necessarily a keyword or an ad quality score. So, just turning this one off and removing it from the account, this one ad could dramatically improve your performance. And then, Google actually tells you what you need to do to increase those strength things. So this report is ultimately powered by this one. So for your ad strength improvements, they'll tell you, "Try adding a few more unique headlines or unpinning some of the ad sets. Try including more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines." So-

Timothy Davis (00:52:00):
Including more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines. So they're actually giving you this information, but more times than not, I just feel like people are just missing this and just not taking action on it. So definitely some stuff available within the account that will help you focus on that signal versus the noise that you could be just getting from the clicks, the impressions and all those things that are available to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):
That was amazing. For folks not watching on YouTube, you pulled up actual reports from, I think, imagine, past clients, is that what the data was from?

Timothy Davis (00:52:24):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:32):
Okay, so actual reports from past clients of how you evaluate, and this is Google Ads, basically.

Timothy Davis (00:52:38):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):
Google Ads data. Incredible. Okay. And so within those reports, you had poor, excellent. How do you determine when something is going great? Is that something you set, like if it's above this threshold? Is that a benchmark you have, or is that Google telling you, "This is poor, or this..."

Timothy Davis (00:52:54):
Yeah, so that's Google telling you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:56):
Okay.

Timothy Davis (00:52:57):
There's sometimes where you'll work really, really hard to take that poor to an average, that average to an excellent, and there's just not a whole lot you can do sometimes. It kind of is what it is. But I would argue more times than not, people are not doing those things to improve their ad strength. So just if you have the change history available in every account, in Meta, in Google, if people are doing the test to try and improve and get better, great. You have the right people working. But if not, that's a clear indication that there's definitely room for improvement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:40):
Something that someone asked on Twitter is for benchmarks around any of the stuff. How do you know when your CPC is good? I guess you just look at... Do you look at Google telling you it's excellent versus poor? How do you know if your conversion rate is good? How do you know if your CAC is good?

Timothy Davis (00:53:54):
Yeah, every industry and every company is going to be different, healthcare, lawyers, those are some of the highest cost and average CPCs I've seen. If I was to compare that industry, say to a B2B industry, it would not be very good at all. Honestly, what I would tell the user to do, every single platform has partners available, more times than not, they're kind of like salespeople. I actually really like the partners that we have at Shopify, because I do feel that they are partners. Shout out to Francisco at Google, and Sami and Alana at Meta. And Nick, and Sam, and Brian at LinkedIn, in case they all hear this. But I think they're really great partners, and they will give you that information.

(00:54:44):
They will actually say, "If you give me the five people you consider to be your top competitors, I will tell you if you are above or below a certain threshold." Now they can't tell you CAC because they would have to have transparency into conversions. But click-through rate, conversion rate, cost per click, things like that, they will give you that information because they will anonymize it, so you won't know who is who. If you say, "My competitor's monday.com," they won't say, "monday.com has a click-through rate of 5%." They won't tell you that. But they will tell you, "Of the competitors you gave us, and we added three more in just to say, hey, we found some people." And also to where if you only give them two, you can be like, "Oh, it's one or the other." That they'll give you that information because they want you to succeed. Because if you succeed, you spend more money on their platform.

(00:55:38):
So if you find out your average CPC is really high, take the actions that are in the account that tell you what you can do to lower it. But if you find out that you have a lower CPC, you're like, "Oh, great, I thought that was worse." And then you can communicate that internally to your team and say, "Hey, our average CPCs may seem high, but in reality we got with our partners, and we are on par with the industry."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:02):
Got it. So the advice is, don't seek generic benchmarks for any of these metrics. You can talk to your rep at Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera. And they'll give you essentially the numbers-

Timothy Davis (00:56:13):
Great summary. Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:14):
Amazing. Okay, going back to the report you just showed, is that a report you developed custom that gives you, here's the most important stuff to pay attention to? Or is it basically an export from Google Ad Manager, and...

Timothy Davis (00:56:26):
So these are all exports, so that this is just the visualization of the data that's available. So this all data is available in every account. This is data available in the account, this is data available in the account. Now in saying that, there are more reports that we get into, like impression sharing frequency. This is something I tend to look at, that not a lot of other people do. It's not about showing as often as possible because that's what impression share tells you, and that's kind of like ego marketing. I want to be number one, I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.

(00:57:06):
Instead of thinking about being on top of the page, you should think about serving the right user, which can be measured with our click share. And then Google will put us on top of the page, which we can see through our top impression share. That's what this whole visualization is here for, where I feel like a lot of people don't do this type of visualization. And this can be done by leveraging all the user data available on Google, such as demographics, locations, if any audiences, in-market audiences. Testing different bid strategies and more.

(00:57:40):
So the data's readily available, but it's just making the visualization a little bit more digestible. And the reason that I actually have two here to show is because this is an example of when I was working on an account back in 2023, where we started making some changes. And you can see that, clearly, our impression share, I would say was baseline. It didn't really change too much, but look at our click share going up. Because now again, we're talking more to the right people, not necessarily just everyone, generic people. Versus this campaign that was... This was the test and this was the control, and you can clearly see that we were talking to a lot of people, but no one cared about what we were talking about. So this was an easy test to call and just say, "This one's performing a lot better." And then verifying the other metrics still look good, conversion rate, number of conversions, stuff like that. This one was the clear winner, so we went in this direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
This is super cool. I love that you're showing this. And again, plug for YouTube to actually see the charts you're talking about. I see one more slide on this deck. I'm curious, what's there?

Timothy Davis (00:58:49):
Yeah, so this one, I'm hoping you have show notes that we can give a shout-out to somebody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Timothy Davis (00:58:56):
Yep. There's a website called PPC Hero. What I usually tell people is, "Terrible name, great content." The actual website used to be a little bit more cartoonish with superheroes on it, but now it's, they've refined it. But the writer there, his name's Jacob Brown. This is what he calls the true competition metric. And again, this is why I highly recommend we give people the link to the article because this does get a little dense. So what he does is that he creates four new metrics with the Auction Insights that are available. And two of those metrics are position above rate when we show, and amount of times they show and we don't. Added together, and it will show how often a competitor ranks above you in all auctions you're available for. Using this type of lens is an effective way to identify genuine threats.

(00:59:56):
Not that just, this data can be used to gain comprehensive insights like determining your position and impression share, but by creating a baseline that you can see how this data changes over time through different bid strategies, keyword ad copy optimizations and more. This is a very, very powerful one, because I do know a lot of people are always concerned about, "What are my competitors doing? How are they doing it? Why are they doing it?" And with all the smart bidding currently available...

(01:00:25):
Back in my day, it was all manual bid, so you could change the bid ever so slightly, and then be like, "Oh, now my competitor's showing above me," and this is even before Google gave us Auction Insights data. This is now available to us in the platform. Using this report will actually identify a true threat, as opposed to making an assumption based on personalization that maybe you're seeing when you Google a keyword, or using a tool like Semrush that ultimately is saying, "Oh, this person's appearing above you. Well, let's run this report and see if it's a genuine threat," as opposed to just maybe ego marketing going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:09):
Super cool. And this comes from PPC Hero, is this what you're saying?

Timothy Davis (01:01:13):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:13):
Cool. We'll definitely link to that. Are there any other tools or workflows that you find really helpful in analyzing this endless amount of data?

Timothy Davis (01:01:24):
Please, audience, if you are using AI in this way, let me know because a lot of this stuff I do can be a little manual and can be a little time-consuming. If they've found ways to automate through AI where I can provide the information that isn't sensitive, that they will make it a lot cleaner, and a lot more digestible, let me know. But a lot of the things, I have templates that you can load the data into, and it will just automatically give you the result from it. But yeah, right now, it is a little manual, but if there's a way to automate this through AI, please, users, contact me on LinkedIn and let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):
Sounds like a startup opportunity right there.

Timothy Davis (01:02:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Sweet. Okay, let's move in a slightly different direction. Attribution, what a sexy, exciting topic. So attribution, basically it's how do you assign credit to a channel and to a campaign, so that you know where growth is coming from, what's working? What's the state of attribution today? What do you find is helpful? How do people do attribution well in today's world?

Timothy Davis (01:02:35):
Yeah, I'm a big believer and proponent in multi-touch. I fall into the camp of more time decay. Historically, the research I've done, users tend to forget very quickly where they first found your brand. Yes, you should get credit because this is the first time they saw your brand or the first time they interacted with it, for sure, let's give you some credit for that. But definitely not the reason that they ultimately converted. Linear is fine as well, but overall, I do think attribution by itself is biased. It does not answer the question of whether the person clicking on or seeing an ad would've converted anyways, even in the absence of that ad.

(01:03:24):
This is why numerous companies like Netflix and eBay have done studies to get an understanding of the incrementality of paid advertising campaigns, whether that's conducting GeoX or Conversion Lift tests at important slices of the marketing channel. I know eBay was very popular when they did that experiment. I think it was like 2012, and I'll have a link for you for that as well. Where they ultimately decided to cut almost all of their brand spend, because they found that users were already going to find them through organic anyway, so they were just kind of throwing money out the window. And it was really hard for competitors to get their ads at the top of the page because their quality scores were so low.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
Okay, so multi-touch is the way you like to think about it. Basically give credits to all of the channels that you detected the user saw your ad on, and less credit if it was further back in time.

Timothy Davis (01:04:19):
Right, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):
And then in terms of tooling, is there tools you love? Is it stuff you build in-house generally? How do people go about doing this sort of stuff?

Timothy Davis (01:04:28):
Yeah, I don't know if I want to say I have been fortunate or not, but most of the companies I've worked with, like the big companies of the world, the Pinterests, the Shopifys, the IBMs of the world tend to build things in-house. So from a third-party tool, unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot of go-tos for that. So again, either that's a, I've been fortunate or I've been sheltered.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:54):
And then, are there tools that you see people use, or is it just really nothing amazing out there?

Timothy Davis (01:05:00):
Yeah, none that I've seen that's like, "Oh wow, that's amazing." I will always say, make sure you're trying to leverage the in-platform tools because the biggest thing with performance marketing is the signal you're sending the platform. Because if you are telling the platform, "Oh, I want to get more of the users that are doing this action," it's going to do a really good job of giving you that. But if that action doesn't equal business results, you're not helping yourself at the end of the day. You're giving it, again, a lot of noise instead of the right signal. So try and leverage the in-platform tools. Or if there is a tool you're using, make sure it does allow third-party integration through the Google, Meta, TikToks of the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Then let's talk about incrementality. You mentioned this idea of how do you know if the money you spent led to incremental growth that wouldn't have happened if you didn't run that ad. Is there any advice there, anything you've seen about just how to think about incrementality correctly, and not just give yourself all this credit for stuff that would've happened anyway?

Timothy Davis (01:06:09):
Yeah, I mean, there are many ways to judge the effectiveness of growth overall. Like some of the stuff we talked about before, brand metrics, awareness, recall, things along those lines. There are also, I know some companies look at leading indicators like visits, and clicks, or tribute, which of the efforts are linked to or perceived drivers of actions. Like leads, conversions to prospect, prospect to scale. But really the results should be coming from either that GeoX or Geo experiment or Conversion Lift. The results of those experiments should ultimately fuel the plans for what we call IAF, incrementality adjusted factor, and will allow you to be more precise and how efficient each channel is.

(01:07:03):
Ideally, by region, sometimes you just have a holistic of like, "This is how Meta is, this is how YouTube is." But if you don't have it by region, don't fret, it's fine, just have it by platform. And kind of like what does that look in practice? When you're running a Conversion Lift test, you intentionally do not show your ad to some users when you win an auction, and instead Google shows the next bidders' ad. This is your control group, and adds up to some opportunity costs that is estimated in terms of impression share percentage, as well as spend holdback. Spend holdback is like how much money you will not spend because of this test.

(01:07:42):
And all of the platforms are willing to partner with you on this, because Facebook knows this, LinkedIn knows this. All of them know that they are very visually-based creative assets that are not getting as much credit as they deserve. So if you go to any of them, if say you don't have a dedicated rep you can call, and if you ask for this, more times than not, they are willing to partner with you in saying that, if you're not spending enough, they probably will not help you with this. Because there are certain spend thresholds you do need to meet. But I would say at least start there. And also if you're not spending more than I would say 50K a month in the platform, doing this is going to be a lot more work than you're going to get result from, you're just not going to have enough signal there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
So basically don't worry about running incrementality tests when you're-

Timothy Davis (01:08:39):
Yeah, when you're starting out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):
Got it. Okay. And so basically to understand actual incrementality, every platform has a way for you to actually test it on the platform, and the team there can help you run it.

Timothy Davis (01:08:51):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
Awesome. Okay. Let's go back to talking about team structure and how to build your own performance marketing team. So we talked about the first person that you hire and the advice there was someone that's very, understands how to find signal in noise. So there's that one person, and your advice there was maybe around like 50K. Was that like an actual threshold that you usually recommend, or is that just like an example?

Timothy Davis (01:09:14):
Every business is slightly different. I mean, if they're well funded, 50K may not... the threshold may be higher. But yeah, everyone's different. 50K may be, like if somebody said... If you were to just say, "Hey, give me a number," I would say, "50K to start having those conversations." Because if you're at 50K, say for the month of June, great, it's going to take us three months to hire someone anyway, so at least start the conversations now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):
Awesome. Okay. What do the first three to five hires look like generally, that you recommend for scaling internally from its marketing?

Timothy Davis (01:09:48):
So the first thing, like we said, someone data-driven that can get into the platforms. The next is going to be creative. Because I need those two now working hand-in-hand, making sure the creative is matching the tone and also the performance that we're trying to achieve as a business. And then third would be a dedicated data scientist, a fully dedicated person. Because they can help you with things like the incrementality testing. They can help create reports that will ultimately make everyone's lives better. They will be able to build analyses that as a generalist will not be able to do yourself. There's a saying of like, "I'm not a data scientist, but I like to play one online." Because what they do, they ultimately make us look really good. Because we're ultimately the ones reporting on the performance of it, but they were the ones that helped build that environment, and build all those things for us to succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):
And then in terms of the creative person, is that like a graphic designer? Is it like a marketing person? What's the actual skill set there?

Timothy Davis (01:11:02):
It would be more graphic design/branding. The reason for that is because if you have a good marketing mix, you're going to have... If we keep it to a three-step funnel of awareness, consideration, purchase, you're going to need to build some brand equity in a specific direction. You're going to need to make sure you're communicating value, which now you're not being as creative, you're being more directional. And then ultimately the purchase is like, "Hey, click here, convert now." So you do want to give them the ability to still be creative. "Hey, I hired you because you have a good creative eye and you're good at what you do, but now we need to focus on getting that person to convert." So you give them a little free rein to be creative, but then you also need them to be able to execute against that creative, you need to get those users to convert.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:54):
And they're also writing the copy, I imagine for the Google Ads.

Timothy Davis (01:11:59):
I usually say that should be collaborative. The performance marketer should be able to write most of the ads, but I can't tell you how many times in my career where I've written an ad and I'm like, "This is the greatest ad ever written known to man. People will write stories about this ad, it is amazing." And it flops because I'm not the target audience, more times than not. So I think it should be collaborative, and no idea should be left on the cutting room floor because... Perfect example. I was working with ADT, the security company. We wrote the most perfect ad when Google Ads only allowed a headline and two descriptions of 35 and 35. We got every single value prop in there somehow, it was amazing.

(01:12:50):
And the ad that it was going against was dollar sign, zero setup fee, dollar sign, zero install fee. That ad won. It was like that is... No, how did that... It barely uses any of the characters, and it tells you almost nothing, but it won. Had more conversions, a higher click-through rate. So we took that, and we applied that with the value props, and it did better. So it should never be like, unless the idea is don't buy our product, which hopefully someone is not writing that ad copy. It shouldn't be left on the cutting room floor. Always test it. Always be willing to learn what works, what doesn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
For this first hire, what's the title of this person, usually in your experience?

Timothy Davis (01:13:38):
Lately, it's been growth marketing specialist, growth marketing manager, because they're going to wear multiple hats. Like at any startup that you're at, you're going to be asked one day to, "Hey, I want you to do performance ads," and then tomorrow it's like, "Hey, I need you to help me build out this spreadsheet for a spec sheet that you have no idea what you're doing." So you're always going to wear multiple hats, so just having a general title like that to start out with. And then if that person matures into a role, you can make them more of a specialist. Or if they start showing signs of like, "Hey, I really like doing the social stuff, and we've scaled enough. Okay, let me hire a paid search person." So yeah, I always start with a general, and then as the team grows, we get more into specialties.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
So growth marketing person, it's kind of like the broad umbrella.

Timothy Davis (01:14:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
And then are these people sitting in Google Ad Manager and Meta Ads and just like running ads manually?

Timothy Davis (01:14:38):
At Shopify, we call it GSD, getting shit done. I'm a firm believer in getting shit done. You should be in the account, like I mentioned earlier with that ops cadence, we have stuff we need to be doing weekly, bi-weekly, monthly. The bigger the company gets, the [inaudible 01:14:55] you wind up in more and more meetings talking about the things you want to do, and how you're going to do it and stuff like that. But keeping those people kind of sheltered away from that and focused on those things, are going to drive the best results for you, you possibly can get.

(01:15:11):
And that means hands-on keyboards in the Ads Manager, tweaking things. Setting up a calendar. I'm a firm believer in setting up a calendar. "We started this test on this day, that means this test will end a month from now." Put a notification, so you have a cool down period, and you report out to the org what you did, how you did it, why you did it, and then the results from it. And then, all right, what we learned from this is this, and we will be applying that to our next test, and this is how. So yeah, hands-on keyboards doing all of those things. So again, hiring those smart people, and just getting out of their way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:47):
I love that. In terms of how this team grows, you mentioned when we were chatting, that you wait for someone to cry uncle, to hire more and to add to the team to kind of avoid bloat. Talk about that.

Timothy Davis (01:16:02):
Unfortunately, we've seen a lot in the news lately with a lot of tech companies letting go of some really talented people, and that is, I feel like just created bloated organizations. We, every month, my current manager, Dean, created this calculator that we look at that says, "How much time are you spending in meetings?" If you have any PTO coming up, put that in there. Optimizations, reporting, stuff like that to basically add up to how many days are in the quarter? Because every quarter... Well, not every quarter, but most quarters you'll have vacation, or you'll have, say, what we call a Shopify burst, where it's we meet in real life to get shit done in real life as opposed to remotely. Put all that in there, and then what does the number equate to? Oh, we're in the red right now for these two to five people.

(01:16:59):
How many quarters has it been that way? Okay, it's only this quarter. This quarter, we have a summit coming up, or we have a burst coming up, or we have a lot of travel because we're meeting with partners, so on and so forth. So maybe this is an isolated thing, let's go ahead and wait till next quarter. All right, next quarter, it's red again. All right, now maybe we need to start having the conversation of, what this new hire will take over, what they will be responsible for, and how much work they'll be taking on and doing, to replace some of this red that is going on.

(01:17:31):
And if it equates to a full head, great, we can move forward, we've made our business case. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes we're just red, and we need to do a better job of making sure, "Hey, we need to step out of these meetings. These meetings are sucking out our time and we don't need to be a part of it." Or, "This launch, we don't need to be a part of. We just need to be consulted on it. We don't need to be in every single meeting every single time, or every single communication." So just making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making-

Timothy Davis (01:18:00):
Just making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making sure that we have stuff for them to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:06):
And red means they have more work?

Timothy Davis (01:18:09):
Yeah. More days than there are in the quarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:12):
And so they basically estimate, "Here's how many days I need to do the things I've committed to for the quarter." And then it's like, "How many actual days do you have this quarter?"

Timothy Davis (01:18:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):
That is super cool. And so step one is, 'Okay, if you're in the red, let's cut some stuff." And then if they're still in the red and you've cut stuff, then, " Okay, we need to start hiring."

Timothy Davis (01:18:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:32):
That is very cool. Is that a Shopify thing or is that something you do at your team?

Timothy Davis (01:18:36):
I've done stuff like that at other companies before, but kind of bringing it forward again, I don't want to take the credit for it. Dean was the one that brought it back up. It was like, "Oh yeah, I used to do this. I don't know why I stopped doing it." So it's definitely something I've used at other companies for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):
That is super cool. You mentioned this opps cadence. Is that something you can describe just what this cadence looks like of how you run?

Timothy Davis (01:18:59):
Yeah. So I love me a spreadsheet. So it's just a spreadsheet. And visually, I'll do my best to describe it. Let's say column A has those buckets I was talking about a finance, performance structure, keywords, so on and so forth. And then within those buckets ... Or let's call those ... Everyone loves rocks and pebbles right now, right? So that's your big rock. Your big rock is keywords.

(01:19:24):
Then within that you have pebbles. Keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negatives, so on, so forth. And then within that we say how often we're doing it. Are we doing it weekly, bi-weekly, monthly? And then that allows us to ... If anyone in the organization's like, "Hey, how often are you guys updating ad copy?" Easy answer. "How often are you guys doing search query reports?" Easy answer, And it allows us to make sure we hold ourselves accountable to those things because a lot of times we have a lot we're doing, We're working in Google, we're working in Meta, we're working in YouTube. You could easily forget, "Oh, I didn't do that. I got to make sure I do that again." So it's a way to hold yourself accountable, but it's also a way for me as a manager to go in and kind of spot check that and make sure that they're doing the things that need to be done in the account.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:19):
The core of this, essentially, there's a spreadsheet that everyone aligns on of here's when and how often we do certain activity to operate this performance marketing machine that you've built.

Timothy Davis (01:20:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:30):
Awesome. And it's both internally so that everyone knows, and then also when people ask, "Hey, when are you going to do this?" "Okay, here's the data."

Timothy Davis (01:20:37):
Yeah. Yeah. So if a cross-functional team or partner wants to know, easy answer. "We got it for you right here. Here's our whole opps cadence."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:46):
In terms of the team, something else folks told me about you is that you're very hardcore about training new people that you hire. What does people mean by that?

Timothy Davis (01:20:56):
Yeah. There's a book called ... I think it's The First 90 Days, and in it actually has a graph that shows when the person starts having impact and how many days it's been. And more times than not, it takes about ... We've all heard it. 90 days for someone to have impact.

(01:21:14):
I want to try and make that 45 days, if not 30. Most of the time it has to do with learning the culture, learning the people understanding, "Yes, you've done paid before at this other job, but this is how we do it here." That's where the opps cadence really comes in handy. It's like, "Here's how often we do it here. I understand maybe you did it monthly there, but we do it here biweekly. And you're saying you used to do it biweekly, we do it weekly and this is how."

(01:21:47):
And also giving them responsibility early on for something. For example, Kat on my team was hired 8ish months ago. She was thrown into the fire very quickly. It was like, "Hey, we have this campaign coming up called additions. Here's everything we did last additions. This is the results. These are your responsibilities, these are the expectations. Go. Go forth and conquer. As you come along. There may be something that doesn't make sense. I'm here by all means ask questions."

(01:22:24):
But what I've noticed is twofold. One, when you're clear in what is expected of them, like, "You are expected to do this when and you already know how to do it. Great." Or also in one-on-ones, I'll just open up the account and say, "Hey, this is how I do it. Let me show you the way I'm doing it and how quick it is for me. And you can learn, even though we're remote, I'm showing you as if you're sitting right over my shoulder or we're face to face. This is how I do it." So if you're doing something different maybe ... One plus one is two, three minus one is two, and that's fine. We both got to the same answer. But if you're doing nine times five minus two times 12 divided by 15, nope, we can simplify this."

(01:23:13):
So making sure that they're efficient and effective with their time, they're focusing on that signal versus that noise and giving them responsibility early on to really take ownership of something. You can see that people are a lot more quicker to pick up things and start getting that flywheel going of, "Hey, I want to have impact as soon as possible." Versus, "Oh, hey, go read this handbook week one. Week two, let me introduce you to the team. Week three." It's like slow rolling. "We can speed this up guys. We can get people up to speed and making impact a lot sooner."

(01:23:52):
And also don't expect them to be perfect. You can't expect people to be perfect right out the gate. " I can't remember every little thing I need to tell you, and there may be things I can learn from you." I can't tell you how many times I'm still learning from people around me. It's like, "Oh, that's great. I didn't even think of that or I haven't tried that. I should totally do that." So just know that they're not going to be perfect out of the gate, but giving them clear direction and expectations, we'll get them where they need to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):
I could see why your team is so effective and so successful. This all makes a lot of sense. You mind if I do a rapid fire set of questions that people asked on Twitter about very specific stuff?

Timothy Davis (01:24:40):
Yeah. By all means.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:41):
Okay, ATT, there was a huge change to the way cookies and attribution and tracking worked online and it felt like paid ads kind of like, "Oh, shit. That's not going to work anymore. It's over. Facebook is dead." Clearly that hasn't happened at this point. Just what is the impact that ATT has had on paid ads and performance marketing?

Timothy Davis (01:25:02):
We were just talking about this the other day because we have ... Full transparency, we have people fully dedicated to mobile on the team, and I had reached out to Sasha who's on the team and said, "Hey, what are we doing with ATT? What are we doing scan? All those things? Because has any of our tactics really changed because of say, low opt-in rates?" And the direct answer I got from her was, "As long as we can use scan to provide attribution and measurement for iOS, we're fine." It's like, "Okay, that's very straightforward. I appreciate it." So as long as you're doing those things, you should be okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:50):
Amazing. That's great. So basically the show goes on, things change, but people find ways to work around it. Okay. Creatives, how impactful are creative in the performance of ads generally? Is that like, "Holy shit. People are way under estimating the power of a creative." Or is it like, "Okay, it's like a fringe impact?"

Timothy Davis (01:26:10):
Way underestimating the power of creative. The best example I can give ... Do you remember Dollar Shave Club?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:19):
Absolutely. Their video.

Timothy Davis (01:26:21):
All right. There you go. You remember it. That was creative. Now the person buying it may have done a really good job of just targeting males, but I would argue girlfriends at the time probably would've been aware of it as well. Really good creative should be doing a really good job of telling a story. And if it does that ... Again, going back to what we talked about at the very beginning, if you get that emotion with users, whether that's pulling at the hard strings or comedy, it's going to have a lasting impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:57):
Okay. Chuck on Twitter asked, "When someone steals your traffic, say in Google search results and buying up keywords around your companies, what should you do? Any advice?"

Timothy Davis (01:27:07):
Yeah. So that actually goes back to the visual that we showed and I'll pull it back up as I'm talking through it. The biggest thing is just know that anyone can do that. You can do it too, if you are ultimately concerned about it. But a lot of times competitors could be doing it on accident. And what I mean by accident is within Google, if you're bidding on keywords, Google will do what's called a close variant. If you were to do say e-commerce solution, I bet you Shopify shows up as a close variant at some point or Square or anyone like that. So they could just be mismanaging their account first and foremost. Don't give them that much credit that they're doing this maliciously or even doing it with intent.

(01:27:59):
And again, it will be in the show notes. If you do pull this report and you do notice that there is a clear threat that's going on here, first things first, let's make sure that they're not doing anything egregious like saying, "Lenny and Tim are better than Monday.com."

(01:28:15):
You cannot be, if the brand is trademarked within Google, they cannot use your name within the ad copy. Google more times than not will disallow it, but they could misspell it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Shopify spelled with two I's because Google isn't catching it, but we can always put in a claim to say, "Hey Google, please remove this."

(01:28:40):
But if we do run this ...You can kind of see that the orange line here, and for those that are just listening. Orange line is rather consistent over time. There is a two week period where it dips, but it does come back up. There's another line that at the beginning of this visual, green is actually above orange. And if you look at the green one over time it almost disappears. So the reason I would say make sure you're looking at this report, and it's not just ego marketing, it could be an error. The issue could be the green one, specifically, could have been getting a close variant. They identified it, they removed it. "Oh wait, a couple of weeks later, we didn't fully remove it. Now let's remove it completely. And now they're almost gone completely." So make sure you're looking at the data and reacting to consistent competitor conquesting versus something that could just be an accident or users not knowing what they're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):
Amazing. And this is PPC Hero again, right? PPChero.com or whatever?

Timothy Davis (01:29:44):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:44):
Okay, cool.

Timothy Davis (01:29:45):
We'll share it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:46):
Yeah. We'll link it to it in the show notes. Okay. Last question. AI. You mentioned AI. You're looking for AI tools to help you with your workflows and analyze data. I guess is there anything you've seen AI impact in the work of paid growth and performance marketing, or is it like in the future might, other than obviously the algorithms on the platforms?

Timothy Davis (01:30:06):
I remember having this conversation a couple of months ago. AI, couldn't get away from it, right? It was everywhere, and what we were doing was leadership on know, "In all of our quarterly planning, what are we doing about AI? How are we using ai? What are we doing that's different?"

(01:30:28):
As always, I go to the partners and I say, "Hey, what are we doing about this?" And Francisco at Google, actually, he made a really good point. "You guys have been using AI for years now. Smart Bidding is AI. All of the recommendations within Google Ads is AI. Ad copy recommendations is AI, and that's always been in the platform, so we've always used those things."

(01:30:59):
So it was kind of like, let's reset the conversation of, "Hey, this has been here. We have been using it, this is how we've been using it and moving forward, these are some of the things we think we'll start doing." I do think it's having a huge impact from a content standpoint and a creative standpoint. Now, if those two kind of converge together, you have a perfect storm, right? But it is something that I keep a relative close eye on, but like I said earlier, hopefully some of your users can share more information with me. But it's not something that I would say is overly impactful yet, but I could see how it could be used maliciously if you can do API connections and things along those lines, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):
Wait, what do you mean by that?

Timothy Davis (01:31:49):
Again, Google will disallow certain things, but it takes time sometimes. If the term is copyrighted in Google for ad copy, it'll disallow it immediately. But say they need to do a check, you'll see a lot of times under review or pending in the account. But you'll also see impressions potentially attached to that. It's because Google's like, "Oh, we'll serve a little bit of it, and then if it's malicious, we'll pull it back." I could see a way that somebody could automate AI to where it's always updating it to where it's like, "Oh, let's just get a little drip here, a little drip here, a little drip here." And that little drip equates to a lot, but that's something AI could help with a human doing that would just take forever and be a total waste of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:34):
Got it. Just run tons of ads, just keep trying, trying, trying trying stuff. Slip through the cracks. You mentioned creative. It actually came back to question I forgot to ask. Going back to the team that you hired to run this sort of stuff, you hire this one person, growth marketer, specialist type of person, and the next hire is a creative. What's a sign that it's time to hire the creative person? Is there anything there? Is it just like, "We have budget and this is working?" Or is there anything else of, "Like, okay, this is a good time?"

Timothy Davis (01:33:00):
Yeah, if you're using a creative agency and they're getting you everything you want and you're happy with it, then it may not make sense to hire a creative. But more times not what I've noticed from creative ... Creative independence tend to do better than an agency. The biggest difference I see is that matching the right tone, matching the right creative look and feel that you're going for is accomplished way better in-house, and also coming up with new ideas that you can test quickly and iterate on versus, "We only have so many hours with the agency this month, or we only have so much budget we can spend with them." Where if you have that person in-house fully dedicated to the product itself, you'll never run into those caps.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):
It feels like if anywhere that scenario AI is going to empower that initial hire to do more creative on their own, you would think?

Timothy Davis (01:33:56):
Yeah. Yeah. And that's not always the best way to go. I've seen some ads in there where it's like, "Oh yeah, they're being scrappy. I see what they're doing." But to your point, maybe that's where AI kind of bridges the gap. Because I can't tell you how many times in the past it's like, Guys, we've got to be able to do retargeting, but we have no creative to do." Google has the dynamic ad builder and they've had it for I feel like years now, and that was just like, "Give us a couple of images and we will make a display ad for you that should perform because we're testing many different iterations of it." Meta is probably going to come along with something as well that it's like, "Give us a picture of your product and we'll put different backgrounds on it and test what works and what doesn't." Things along those lines.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:45):
That makes so much sense. Timothy, we've covered so much ground. This is everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think would be important or valuable for listeners when they're trying to do this stuff on their own? Any other nuggets left that we haven't already covered?

Timothy Davis (01:35:05):
Yeah. I said it at one point, but I'll reiterate it. I'm always forward thinking, backwards planning. Just as you're going through it, "Where do you want to be and ultimately how do you think you're going to get there?" Because say your goal is to be on all platforms. "I want to be on Pinterest, I want to be on X, I want to be on everything." "Okay, forward think. That's where you want to be. Now let's backwards plan. "What can we do right now? We can do search because that's only content and that's keywords. We can do that. All right, now we need creative, but where do we start?" And then make iterations along the way. It's just always forward think, backwards plan, and that's for anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:49):
What are other examples of forward thinking? Because in a sense everyone will be like, "I want to be on every platform." I guess what are other things that people think about when they're like, the forward thinking is like, "Oh, we want to win Google search." Is that an example of forward thinking? What else? What else should people thinking?

Timothy Davis (01:36:06):
Yeah, exactly. What are those goals you want to hit? One of the things that we look at is what emerging channels to perform in it. "So what is it going to take for us to consider this channel a performing channel that is an always on, we're we're adopting it as BAU? So that's going to take a thousand conversions a month at this much spend with this much lift associated with it. So okay, we know what that looks like, so we're going to backwards plan where we're going to start. We're going to start with this one ad creative. "Okay, that works. Then we're going to go to this next ..." Because within each platform, they all have multiple types of ad units You can use. Say in LinkedIn, there's feed, there's conversation, there's video, there's carousel. So it's what are the milestones along the way that you're going to do to ultimately get it from testing emerging channel to perform them? So that would be an example of something more micro than macro.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:16):
Got it. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Timothy Davis (01:37:22):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
First question. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Timothy Davis (01:37:28):
Daily Stoic by far. A book I read every day. Quick excerpt of what you can do from a stoic philosophy standpoint. Great By Choice is another good one. And Deep Work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):
Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Timothy Davis (01:37:49):
X-Men '97. Thoroughly enjoyed that. But that may be a lot of nostalgia. I actually never watched RRR when it first came out. Highly recommend that. That was a lot more enjoyable than I was anticipating. The Playlist, which is about Spotify, Welcome to Wrexham and Billion Dollar Code, also on Netflix, about Google Earth. Very interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:16):
Yeah, RRR. That movie is intense and very long also. It's like, man, I

Timothy Davis (01:38:21):
Three and a half hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:23):
... just have to split it up into different days to finish it, but it is incredible. No intent. Okay. Favorite recent product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Timothy Davis (01:38:31):
I drink too much caffeine and I've been trying to cut it out and I kind of circled back to this product I used to use called Magic Mind. It's a little shot every single day. Tastes really good and it does help with focus I find. If it's a placebo, great, I don't care, but it's helping me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:52):
That's amazing. I'm also a huge fan of Magic Mind. I'm friends with the guy that started it. So funny that you love it. I drink it often.

Timothy Davis (01:38:53):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:00):
I am on the subscription plan and I think he uses Shopify to sell it.

Timothy Davis (01:39:05):
He does. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:06):
It all connects. Amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family? Find useful in work in life?

Timothy Davis (01:39:15):
Happiness is dedicated by expectations or dictated by expectations. That can't be more true more times than not, and it's similar. That's why I said there's two, and this one's similar to it. You won't see it for what it is until you stop looking through the lens of what you want it to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:35):
Amazing. It reminds me of an equation a colleague of mine once shared. He wrote a book of emotional equations or life equations. It was happiness is reality minus expectations.

Timothy Davis (01:39:48):
Yeah. Love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:51):
Okay, next question. Who's had the most influence on you in your career?

Timothy Davis (01:39:56):
Well, we mentioned him before, so I got to bring him back up. Kasey Winters for sure. We were at a wedding. He showed me the original version of Google Analytics. For those of you that don't know, it's called Urchin, and when he showed that to me, it was, "Wait, you know all of this information about users coming to the site." I knew I wanted to do marketing, but at that moment I knew I was going to do digital marketing and watch him grow in his career. He's watching me grow in my career. We still balance each questions off of each other. We cannot not have a phone call under an hour. So definitely the most impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:36):
Is there something about Casey Winters that people may not know? He's a two time podcast guest, huge friend of the show.

Timothy Davis (01:40:44):
Casey is really good at tennis, like insanely good at tennis. You want to know how good? This is how good he was. In high school, he played ... I'm pretty sure it was our senior year. He hadn't played in a year, maybe a year plus. He was still ranked top 10 in the state of Louisiana for tennis players. Hasn't played in a year and still considered one of the top 10 players. Insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):
Did not know that. I actually played tennis in high school, and so that's amazing. I did not know this. Thanks for sharing that. Timothy, this was incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people figure out [inaudible 01:41:28] marketing, run more paid growth ads, figure out who to bring in to help them do this. Thank you so much for sharing and for being here.

Timothy Davis (01:41:36):
Of course. Appreciate the time.

# A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)

## Transcript

Todd Jackson (00:00:00):
Finding product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years, and it's just underexplored and it's just underexplained as a topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
You've been working on a product-market fit framework.

Todd Jackson (00:00:11):
We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review, and we have found a very consistent set of patterns, demand satisfaction, and efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them from the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
There's essentially four levels of product-market fit: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:00:27):
Roughly, 60% are never going to get past L2.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:29):
These four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck.

Todd Jackson (00:00:34):
You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Hearing level three tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding, selling, pitching.

Todd Jackson (00:00:47):
This is where it starts to get fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
Today my guest is Todd Jackson. Todd is a partner at the legendary VC firm, First Round Capital. I rarely have VCs on this podcast, but as Todd shares at the top of this episode, Todd is a very special VC. Prior to moving into venture, he was product lead for Gmail for four years. He was product manager of Facebook's newsfeed, photos and groups, including leading a major redesign of the newsfeed. He's also a director of product management at Twitter and VP of product and design at Dropbox.

(00:01:21):
He's also a founder and sold his company to Twitter. This episode is a very different and special kind of episode. Todd and the team at First Round have spent the last year looking at all of their data and the journeys of the hundreds of startups that they've worked with over the years. And through that, have put together a very practical and very actionable framework to help founders find product-market fit. They're turning this framework into a three-month program for founders, and in this conversation, Todd shares an exclusive peek into the program, in particular, the stages of product-market fit.

(00:01:55):
We talk about how to know which stage you're in, what to do if you're stuck in that stage, and also what you can change in order to get unstuck. If you're a founder or building a new product within a company and feeling like you're not making as much progress as you'd hope, you will find tremendous value in this conversation. With that, I bring you Todd Jackson after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:02:26):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.

(00:02:56):
WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand. It's an effortless experience from your first user, all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to one million users. Check it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more. That's workos.com/lenny.

(00:03:32):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

(00:04:12):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10 X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny. Todd, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Todd Jackson (00:04:56):
Lenny, I'm excited to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
So first of all, just to mention you're a VC, which is very rare for this podcast. But you're a very special VC, you have a deep background in product, and I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of context on your product background, your product bona fides so people will get a real sense of just how legit you are as a product thinker.

Todd Jackson (00:05:17):
Yeah, you got it. So I am a VC. I'm a partner at First Round Capital now, and I've been at First Round for four years. But I was not a VC before First Round. So I started a company in 2013 called Cover, and that was actually funded by First Round 11 years ago. That's how I got to know First Round. And before that, I had worked on Gmail as the product lead in the early days, early 2000s and at Facebook.

(00:05:39):
And then I started Cover, and we ended up selling Cover to Twitter in 2014. And I worked on a bunch of different products at Twitter. And then I was the VP of product and design at Dropbox. That was 2015 to 2018. So I have always loved product, and that's actually the reason now that I love being a seed stage VC because I love investing at the early stage founders who are pre-product-market fit and then helping them get there. And I just love doing that over and over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:07):
I feel like we could have a whole other podcast episode on why you decided to move into venture versus staying in product.

Todd Jackson (00:06:12):
We can do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):
But we're going to stay focused. So the reason we're here is that for over a year, you've been working on a product-market fit framework, essentially, a framework to help founders and product teams find product-market fit, which we should talk about this. But this is the most important thing you've got to get right as a founder in a product team is finding product-market fit. I got a peek at this framework. I love it. I love the way you've structured it, the way you're thinking about it.

(00:06:36):
So what we're going to do today is walk through this framework in depth. First, I just want to spend a few minutes on setting a little context just so people understand who this is for and how to think about this. So maybe a first question is just why do you believe people need a framework for finding product-market fit? And just also, if you want to touch on why is product-market fit so important? Why is that something people should even be thinking about?

Todd Jackson (00:06:57):
The thing about product-market fit is that I find it's mysterious to a lot of people, and people tend to think about it purely as an art rather than a science. And all the advice that you find out there on the internet is very general when it comes to product-market fit. You'll know it when you see it, you'll know it when you have it. It's not specific. And there's so many other startup topics where there is good content on the internet like hiring your first salesperson, running board meetings, stuff that is specific and tactical. But there isn't that much content around product-market fit that is that specific.

(00:07:33):
And so I think that's actually why Rahul from Superhuman is well-known for his approach to finding product-market fit. That was published on the First Round Review in 2018, and it was immediately popular and interesting to people. And I think the reason is because it was specific and because it was tactical and it brought a little bit of the science to something that people thought was just an art. And I think it's why your content is really popular too, Lenny.

(00:07:57):
You and I worked on this product validation article together a little while back, and the seven part series that you did on B2B SaaS companies and the PMF benchmarking data that you had, I think it was how long it took to get to a product and a customer and to product-market fit, that was super well-read. And there just isn't that much good specific content about this. But like you said, product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years and it's just underexplored, it's underexplained as a topic.

(00:08:28):
So we felt this was a very important thing to do, something worth focusing on. And I've personally talked to hundreds of founders about this topic. We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review. We call this our Paths to Product-Market Fit Series where we interview founders about the early days. And I'm just always interested in what are the patterns. If you talk to enough successful founders, and in this case, it can be enterprise founders, and you ask them, "What did you do in the first six to nine months of running your company, of starting your company? What patterns emerged from that?" And we have found a very consistent set of patterns, and that's what we decided to base our framework around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):
Amazing. And I think you're at such an interesting Venn diagram of exposure to develop something like this. One, you have a deep product background, you started a company, you see tons of startups going through the journey, many succeeding, many not. So I get why one, you wanted to do this and why I think this is going to be so valuable to a lot of people. You talked briefly about why product-market fit is so important, and maybe it might be helpful just to share a little bit more just why is this something people should be so obsessed with and why did you spend so much time developing this?

Todd Jackson (00:09:40):
I think as a founder, there are so many things you have to do. You have to pick a market, you have to find a co-founder, you have to hire a team, you have to raise funding, you have to build a product, you have to sell a product. And so sometimes it gets lost that actually, the only thing that matters in the first couple years is finding product-market fit and actually, what we define as extreme product-market fit, and I'll go into that. Because if you find extreme product-market fit, the momentum just carries you, and the market pulls you along. And it's easy to know what to build because you're building the thing that your customers want and it's motivating as a team. It's easy to hire people, everything becomes easier if you find product-market fit, it is the thing that propels the company.

(00:10:25):
And so we are a seed stage venture firm. We tend to work with very early founders who are pre-product-market fit. And the hard truth about it is that most of them don't get past the first couple levels of it. The majority of startups do not get past, what we call, level one product-market fit or level two product-market fit. And I'll go through and define all that stuff. They get stuck at one of those first couple levels. And if they can unlock the right product and the right way to explain it to a customer and make a customer deeply satisfied, and there's enough customers out there like that, it just pulls the whole thing along.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
Who is this framework for specifically? And for people that are listening, how do they know if this is for them or not?

Todd Jackson (00:11:07):
This is for early B2B founders, and specifically founders who are doing something that is more sales-led than bottom-up. I think bottom-up is its own world. It's closer to consumer product development in my mind. And I have done consumer products. Consumer product, I think there is a little bit more alchemy involved. It's about having great taste and finding the right thing at the right time and it's like catching lightning in a bottle.

(00:11:36):
I think the good thing about enterprise, and specifically sales-led B2B, is that there is more science to it. And so it is for sales-led B2B founders who are in, let's call it, the first six to nine months of starting their company and want to set the foundation for product-market fit right from the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):
Awesome. Okay. So B2B founders, sales-led in the first six to nine months of their journey. Awesome.

Todd Jackson (00:11:59):
That's right. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
You talked about the science of this. I imagine you don't want to overpromise this is going to help you find product-market fit, step one, two, three profit. How do you think about just what the benefits of this are and how people should think about the chance that they will find product-market fit at the end of this journey following this framework?

Todd Jackson (00:12:16):
We can't guarantee success here. I just want to contextualize that finding extreme product-market fit is very, very hard. And what we are trying to do is increase your odds, increase the odds, reduce the role of luck, give you a framework and way of thinking about the things that you need to do. And I think that that can increase the odds. Like I said earlier, the majority of startups are getting stuck at these first couple levels. I think if you know what the path looks like and you know what the levers are at your disposal and you know what you need to aim for, I think we can get more of these companies to level three and level four product-market fit, which is where you really want to be and where you have a very valuable company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:54):
Perfect. Okay, final question. You launched a whole program for founders to go through and learn all of this in depth, many week kind of program. We're going to be covering a lot of it here for folks that want to go a lot deeper and actually go through this program. Talk about how they find this and how this program works.

Todd Jackson (00:13:11):
So we launched a new program, and we call it Product-Market Fit Method. It is designed, like I said, to help early B2B founders increase the odds of finding product-market fit. It's totally free, it's a very intensive program. You can see all the details at pmf.firstround.com, and the application deadline is May 7th. The program starts on May 29th. And we actually ran a beta version, a test version of this late last year with 11 founders, I think probably some you know, Lenny, from Stripe and Plaid and Airbnb and Twitter. And the feedback, it was great. It made me feel very good.

(00:13:47):
One of the founders was like, "I feel like these 14 weeks saved me two years of time in what would've been wandering through the desert." And so there's eight sessions in the full program, and the first one is the one we're going to do today. So the first session is on what we call the levels of product-market fit. The second one is on customer discovery, and we actually refer to it as dollar-driven discovery. We get very specific about not just the normal way of doing customer conversations and customer discovery, but how do you find that a customer is willing to pay money for this thing and a lot of money?

(00:14:22):
We talk about market validation, product positioning. We do a section on design partners because I think a lot of founders have questions about that. How do I find the right design partners? What's the right way to structure an agreement with them? How do I convert them to paying customers? All that stuff. We talk about product iteration and pivots, and I refer to this stage as the grind, the grind of product iteration. And then we spend a ton of time on founder-led sales.

(00:14:47):
And the reason that we do that is we really like working with very technical founders, builders, people that are either engineering background, product design, data science, people who are builders. So that's the program in a nutshell. And like I said, any founder working on a new B2B SaaS company, welcome to apply. And then bonus points if you are technical, like I said, if you have a clear product idea or a hypothesis, but that you're less than six to 12 months into building the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
I love how incentives are so aligned here. You help companies find product-market fit. If First Round does great, everyone does great. It makes so much sense to build something like this. One thing I can't help but mention or ask about is you said it's an intensive program. How do you find founders have time to do something like this and also be building their company? I know this helps them build, but how do you just think about they have so much to do, they have time to do a program like this?

Todd Jackson (00:15:41):
The way that we think about it is that the program roughly takes about 10 hours a week for each founder, and it's 10 hours of work that you were going to be doing anyway. It is literally you're talking to customers, you're improving your positioning, you're doing critical thinking about your market and what you should be building. And so the way I think about it, and the way I've heard from the 11 founders that went through it is it just added structure to what I was doing anyway and it actually made me more efficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):
Last question, you mentioned that it's free. How does that work? How does that work for everyone?

Todd Jackson (00:16:14):
So it's 100% free and literally, it costs you $0. We give you $0, we own 0% of your company. And it's pretty different than I think a lot of other programs out there. And this is just something we do. Over the years, we've run First Round Angel Track, which I know you were in, Lenny. We've run the First Round Review for 10 years. We make these things free and our belief is that you have to create value in the ecosystem.

(00:16:36):
You have to put stuff out in the world that is useful, and if you can create that value, create enough value with the audience, then you'll be able to capture that value at some point. And so we think there's a win-win here. We get an inside look at some of tomorrow's great companies and they get an inside look at First Round.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:49):
Got it. So companies don't have to take money from you guys to be a part of this program.

Todd Jackson (00:16:53):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
Okay, let's get into it. Let's talk about this framework. Maybe just as a broad strokes overview, how does this framework work? How do companies find product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:17:03):
So the framework starts with a very simple idea that is product-market fit is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and it doesn't just happen overnight. And for B2B companies, specifically, it does tend to follow a repeatable pattern. And so we start with defining the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to get to extreme product-market fit. And we have a precise definition for this. Let me read it to you. So extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.

(00:17:40):
And so there's three key ideas in there: demand, satisfaction and efficiency. And I think efficiency is worth highlighting because that's what most people would leave out of their definition. You talk about like, "Oh, it's a product, people like it. That's good, that's product-market fit." But if you look, there's products out there. I was a big fan of WeWork, as a customer of WeWork. And I'm a fan of Casper and these other products. Those products managed to achieve customer satisfaction and demand, but they never got the efficiency right, and so the whole business just never worked at scale.

(00:18:18):
And my partner, Brett Berson, at First Round, he gives this example of the $100 vending machine, and I really like this example, which is imagine I built a vending machine and I stuck it in the middle of San Francisco. And you walk up to this vending machine and you put a dollar in and $100 bill comes out. And that's the product. That would have insane demand. There would be a line at that vending machine. I think people would be extremely satisfied. They'd be like, "This is awesome." The retention would be very good. I'm sure they would come back tomorrow. But the whole thing is it's ridiculous. The whole metaphor is ridiculous because it's just not viable to do something like that.

(00:18:59):
And yet you see a lot of startups kind of do this. They're basically with their products, giving away $2 for $1 and it gets them pretty far. But that's not real product-market fit. And so that's one of the reasons that we think efficiency and how you think about the economic model of what you're doing is very important. And then this other aspect that I like, which is we have this concept that we call the marginal customer, and the next incremental customer you're going to get for your company, for your product. And if you have product-market fit, and as you are progressing along this journey, the marginal customer should be getting easier and easier and easier to get, easier to acquire them, easier to give them good service with a good product.

(00:19:42):
And that means your efficiency is increasing along the way and your product-market fit is strengthening. So you've got to have all three of those things: demand, satisfaction, efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them at once from the very beginning. And so product-market fit, it happens in the sequence of levels, it happens over multiple years. And for the best enterprise companies, I would say they tend to reach extreme product-market fit in roughly four to six years. There's some variance, but roughly four to six years. And so we label these four levels. We say level one product-market fit is nascent product-market fit. Level two is developing, level three is strong, and level four is extreme. And that's where you want to get.

(00:20:26):
And along the way, you're trading off these three dimensions: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency because they're intertwined. You could spend a bunch of money on marketing, and that's going to increase your demand, but you're decreasing your efficiency if you do that. You can invest a bunch in efficiency and automating a whole bunch of stuff, but that actually might harm the customer experience and you're reducing satisfaction. So that's an interesting thing, I think, is you're actually making trade-offs at each level and what you should optimize for at each level is different. And so we talk about all these signs, whether you're getting stuck at a given level, how do you get unstuck and how do you progress along this path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
Amazing. And we're going to go through each of these. And the idea, as a listener, what I'm thinking is you're probably in one of these buckets. What we're trying to do is help you out of that bucket and help you move further up the ladder to the next level. So just to summarize, I have my notes here. So there's essentially four levels of product-market fit, basically, the strength of product-market fit that you have: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:21:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):
Okay. And then you have three dimensions within each of these levels: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. We're going to talk about what all these mean and how you use these. Let's talk about level one, nascent product-market fit. What does that look like? What do you do when you're there if you're stuck? And what are some examples of companies that felt nascent product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:21:44):
Yeah. Okay, level one, nascent. So at this point, you're probably like a pre-seed or seed stage company. You've got less than 10 people on your team. And at level one, your job is to find three to five customers that have a particular problem that is worth solving and to deliver them a satisfying solution. And you got to pick a problem that is both important and urgent to them.

(00:22:08):
And the solution that you deliver needs to satisfy some kind of promise that they care deeply about. So of the three dimensions that you just recapped, Lenny, it's satisfaction first, demand second, efficiency last when you're at level one. It's actually okay to be inefficient at this stage if it helps you uncover something that delivers an insanely good customer satisfaction. And so I think that one of the best examples I can think of that is this company called Vanta.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
Love Vanta. Also, a happy sponsor and I'm an investor. What a great example.

Todd Jackson (00:22:42):
What a great example. So Vanta was founded in 2016 by Christina Cacioppo, and she had come from Dropbox and we got to work at Dropbox together, which was awesome. She was the PM of Dropbox Paper at that time. And so Vanta, it's a company that does compliance automation, continuous monitoring. And most startups think of Vanta is how you get a SOC 2, but they didn't do that at first.

(00:23:03):
And I remember in 2018, Christina and I went on a walk around the South Park neighborhood in San Francisco. And this was the first time I heard the idea of Vanta. And she had actually, in 2016, 2017, tried a few other ideas. She had this smart speaker that would record meetings and it would send meeting summaries over Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):
B2B Alexa is what she called it. I remember.

Todd Jackson (00:23:25):
B2B Alexa. And she had this other idea, something about dropshipping, but she didn't know anything about dropshipping. And she had just been in this mode of like, "We're building stuff and then we're seeing if anybody wants it." And then she realized that wasn't working and she changed what she was doing. And she started talking to potential customers, and she was very interested in the idea of security and why a lot of startups didn't use any security products.

(00:23:48):
And she was talking to security engineers and CISOs and just CTOs and startups. And she would ask them, "What is the thing you hate most about your job as it relates to security?" And over and over and over they would say, "I hate filling out the security questionnaires. I hate doing the compliance audits. It's so much grungy manual work. I'm in there filling out spreadsheets and taking screenshots of my AWS account. And the whole thing just doesn't make sense." And she had actually felt this herself when she was on Dropbox Paper and the experience of getting a SOC 2 was onerous.

(00:24:26):
And the reason that she needed to get it is because we wanted to start selling Dropbox Paper into enterprise. And so she said to me, "There's this pain out there, I think I can solve it, and I think there might be a revenue unlock." And I was like, "What do you mean by that?" And she was like, "Well, I've got these first few customers or design partner, pseudo customers. It's Segment and Front and Figma." And this is 2017, '18. So these companies were smaller at the time, not the big companies they are now. And she was like, "Yeah, they're trying to sell into Fortune 500 companies. One of them is actually trying to land a Fortune 10 right now. And they said the thing that's holding them back is they don't have compliance certification, they don't have a SOC 2.

(00:25:08):
"And I told them, 'Hey, what if I do that for you?' And they were like, 'Oh, you can just do that?'" And she was like, "Yeah." And she did it, and they landed the deal. And it's one of the clearest examples to me of a product that satisfies a promise, but this product is going to unlock revenue for you. You are going to be able to land this enterprise deal. And so I think they just did a phenomenal job of that. And that's what you're looking for when you're at level one, a problem that really matters to three to five customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
That specific example, I think she delivered a spreadsheet. There was no product, she just manually filled out a spreadsheet and gave it to them.

Todd Jackson (00:25:49):
Completely manual. She was the one behind the email address posing as the AI, but doing it herself. And I think that's revealing of it's okay to be inefficient at level one, as long as you are delivering incredible satisfaction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Yeah, I was just going to say that. This is the ultimate example of efficiency is not important, which I love, is what you're pointing out at this step. I know you're going to share another example, but just to summarize what this stage feels like from earlier when you talked about, essentially, of less than 10 people, you're trying to find three to five customers. I think that's so important. You're not trying to find tens or hundreds, you're just like, "Three to five people." And the customer element, I imagine, you're implying they're paying you money.

Todd Jackson (00:26:29):
Yes, they're paying you money and you're delivering a product that solves a problem for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
And the product could be potentially a spreadsheet or super Wizard of Oz at this point even.

Todd Jackson (00:26:37):
Yeah, that's okay at this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):
I know RAMP actually had barely a product when they started selling. Initially, they had someone just updating things behind the scenes on these dashboards. And then you talked about the problem needs to be important and urgent, which connects to people paying attention to a startup that they don't trust or know anything about because the problem is that important and urgent. And you also mentioned it has to satisfy a promise you're giving them, "We'll solve SOC 2 for you," and then you actually accomplish that.

Todd Jackson (00:27:03):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):
Is there anything else maybe as a benchmark that tells you you're at this step of product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:27:10):
Yeah. So like I said, you're pre-seed less than 10 people. Probably, your demand source at this stage is mostly people you know. It's friends and family, it's your network, maybe it's VCs. You haven't probably done a lot of cold outreach at this point, and it's hard to find customers. You're trying to get three to five. It probably takes you 20 warm intros to get one, something along those lines. So maybe to get to three to five, it's at least 50 conversations. That's very normal at this stage because you're just trying to find the right problem and find customers who have it. You're probably in the $0 to 500K ARR, somewhere in that zone. I would say that you're at level one.

(00:27:48):
And then there are metrics to track efficiency, things like burn multiple, gross margin, NRR all of these things. All of them are just not applicable at this stage. It's too early and you shouldn't be worrying about that stuff. And so you want to be feeling this sense of progress that there are customers who need what you are building and the thing you're building works. And so conversely, the signs that we see a lot of founders get stuck, and this is a very common level to get stuck. And so if you're hanging out here for six months, nine months, 12 months, and there's yellow flags that are appearing, you're starting to feel stuck.

(00:28:24):
And so the yellow flags are something like, let's say, your product disappeared overnight, your customers wouldn't be super disappointed. Let's say you have a handful of happy customers. Let's say you've got four or five customers, but the most important feature is actually different for each one of them. That starts to look a little bit more like a consulting business than a product business. Or it just feels incredibly hard to find the marginal customer, the next new customer. Or your usage is low. The product is in their hands, but the usage is low, it's not growing that much. It lasts for six months.

(00:28:55):
And I think, there's a really good example, Jack Altman, who's the founder of Lattice, he founded Lattice in 2015. We've talked to him a bunch on the First Round Paths to Product-Market Fit and other things. So for those who don't know, Lattice is a people management platform, but it didn't start that way. And most people don't know about this, Lattice actually started as an OKR tool back in 2015.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:15):
Oh, didn't know.

Todd Jackson (00:29:16):
Yeah. And so Jack had just seen this at other companies. He's like, "Okay, companies are doing OKRs, but they're not very good at it and it causes a lot of arguments among the executive team and employees are noncompliant. They think the whole thing's dumb. So I can fix that with software." And so the original version of Lattice was for managing OKRs. And he was able to sell it. And so his buyer was the head of HR, and they said, "Okay, yeah, we'll give this a shot." And he had a couple companies using it, and they would use it for one quarter. And then the next quarter would come around, and they were like, "Didn't go that well last time. I don't know, the employees don't seem to like it. I don't know."

(00:29:59):
And then the quarter after that, they were like, "No, we're not buying this, we're not using this." And so Jack pulled off the pivot to people management. And the way that he did it was he actually kept the persona. And so this gets into the ideas of the four Ps, and I'll talk about this a little bit more. This is our version of the four Ps. You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. And all four of these things have to line up. Your product has to deliver a promise that solves the problem of your persona. And so Jack actually kept the persona. He was like, "I've gotten to know these heads of HR really well over the last six to nine months. I text with them, I go out to coffee with them, I'm friends with them, I know them really well. This OKR thing just doesn't seem to be a big deal for them, but they've got other problems that I could look at solving."

(00:30:53):
And the interesting thing was that timing, it was mid-2010s, performance management had started to come back in favor. It was like this pendulum. There was a period of time where performance management was really important, and then all these companies were like, "We're not doing this anymore." And then the pendulum swung back, and around 2015, 2016 was that time. And so Jack literally showed them Figma mock-ups. There was no product, but he's like, "What if I could solve performance management for you in a way that is much more modern and much more employee-friendly and manager-friendly and the whole thing's just going to work better?"

(00:31:25):
And the response was off the charts. And people wanted this thing. And I believe he sold his first five or 10 customers with Figma mock-ups. Before, he hadn't built anything really. And so that, I think, is an interesting example of he was stuck in the zone of people didn't love what he was doing. He kept the persona, but he changed the problem that he was solving and the promise he was delivering through the product. And we do a whole section on pivots and when to pivot and how to pivot. And I think this is actually the best framework for this, is the four Ps. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

(00:32:08):
There are other products like Plaid that actually kept elements of the product they were doing. So I don't know if you know the story of Plaid, but Zach Perret was building... Plaid started out not as like a API for bank accounts. It started out as a consumer budgeting app. It was a consumer app. And it just was supposed to help you save money and budget and stuff. And it just wasn't that popular. And the founders were frustrated, but they had built this part of the product that enabled the app to connect to your bank accounts, and had solved all the nitty-gritty issues with that. And then they found that their friends wanted to license it from them.

(00:32:46):
So Zach had a friend at Venmo who wanted to license this, and they got Robinhood at some point, they got Coinbase at some point. So that's an example of they actually kept a lot of the code that they had written. They kept the product, but they completely changed the other three Ps. Instead of solving for consumers who have a problem with budgeting, we are going to solve for developers at fintech companies who have a problem connecting to bank accounts. And it was a total flip of the four Ps. But that's why I really like this framework because I think it really helps founders think in a structured way about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
Todd, this is amazing. I'm so happy we're doing this. I think this is going to help a lot of people. I want to move on to level two, but first let me try to summarize some of these key elements. So these four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck in this level or any level. And just to summarize, you can change who you're targeting, the persona, you can change the problem you're solving, you could change the way you're pitching it, which is the promise is how you describe it, basically positioning. And then you could also just change your product. You mentioned Vanta changed all four, some companies change just one. Any advice for how to know which of these to change? What points you to change this versus change that? Is there anything that you've seen?

Todd Jackson (00:33:55):
I think different founders approach this differently. And I've seen a lot of founders who are build first and then sell, and I've seen a lot of founders who are sell first and then build. And they can both work. I tend to gravitate towards the, "I want to sell it before I build it," because I really want the signal from customers and I want that to be the guide and the oxygen that drives what I'm building. I find that very motivating. I also find it easier, honestly.

(00:34:25):
Rather than guessing like, "Oh, I'm going to write 50,000 lines of code and then see if somebody wants this thing," I think it's better to talk to a bunch of customers, know that, "Hey, if I had this thing, if I could build this thing, I know it would sell. I know these people want this thing." So I tend to approach it from that point of view and therefore, I focus on the persona and the problem and the promise. What is the promise that is really going to click for that buyer, for that persona? And then the product's job is to satisfy those first three Ps really.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:55):
And obviously, those are much easier to change and play with versus rebuilding your product. So if nothing else, you should probably start there. I actually have a post with a bunch of awesome examples of changing the positioning, changing the persona, and so we'll link to that in show notes if people want more examples. Finally, let me try to summarize the stage. So I think it's important to note at this nascent stage, it's not roaring product-market fit. It's, as you described, very nascent. You're getting customers, but it's hard. You said it's 20 introductions to one sale, but you're getting them.

(00:35:25):
I know Retool has a great quote. David has this quote of, "Every customer he got early on, he felt it was the last customer he was ever going to get. No more people want this thing and it's always a struggle." So I think that's very normal, is what you're describing. The beginnings are rarely off and to the right. And it's okay if this takes a while. You said that if you spent 12 months at this stage, you're probably stuck in the stage, and signs that you're stuck in this nascent stage versus this is actually normal. Signs you mentioned are if you ask people if this went away and they wouldn't be disappointed, they'd be like, "Nah, all right. It's cool."

(00:36:01):
You have many customers, but they're using different features of the product. So to you, the way you described it, essentially, you're professional services for them. You're not actually building a product. You consult a lot of people. And then they're actually not using it often. They're buying, they're paying for it, like the last example, but they're not necessarily using it and they're going to churn pretty quickly.

Todd Jackson (00:36:19):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):
Anything else you wanted to touch on there before we get to level two?

Todd Jackson (00:36:23):
The last thing that I'd add at level one is there's this founder from a company called Persona, his name is Rick Song. He's super awesome. Persona is a First Round company. They do identity verification. And Rick's analogy, I just love it for level one, is you don't want to get friend-zoned by your customers, where your customers like you, but they don't love you and they don't need you. And he was super paranoid about this in the early days of Persona. And his technique for doing this, which I really like, is super simple, was he was very close with his first five or 10 customers.

(00:37:00):
And he would go to them and sit them down one-on-one and say, "I need your help. It is very important to me that this company succeeds and does not fail. So I don't want you to be nice to me. I want you to tell me is Persona a necessity for your company? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor came along that charged half as much as us, would you switch to them?" And he's really trying to get to the essence of: is Persona critical for you or am I in the friend zone? And I just think that's a really great way of thinking about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
I love that story. It's like in a relationship, it's the talk.

Todd Jackson (00:37:37):
It's the talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
"Are we a thing?" I love that. That's so good. The sooner you know the truth, the better. And it's hard to hear bad news, but I love that, just advice of just sit them down one-on-one. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying, "Want to take a tour?" "Check out this new feature." And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible.

(00:38:08):
But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent. So they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions.

(00:38:36):
And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. Let's talk about level two. So what does level two look like? And what should founders be focusing on when they're in level two?

Todd Jackson (00:39:19):
Yeah. So level two is developing product-market fit, and your job at level two is now you've got to go from five satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers. And so now you've got to start thinking about demand in addition to satisfaction. Because it is very hard to just grind your way all the way to 25 customers with sheer willpower, but you can do that to five, maybe 10. And we see some founders who just have phenomenal willpower and grit and grind their way to five or 10 customers. To get to 25 and to get beyond 25, the product has to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. And so that is the essence of this level.

(00:39:58):
So if you're at this level, now you're seed or Series A style company, maybe you've got up to 20 people at the company. And you're starting to work on this demand source where you have the early signs of a scalable channel, and it's not just warm intros from your VCs or from your friends. You're maybe investing in cold outreach and getting that tuned and humming. You might be investing in content, you might be doing community events, but the whole idea is you're trying to scale the demand source. It's still not easy. A benchmark, we would say, is that your sales conversion without a warm intro is still probably 10%, something like that.

(00:40:38):
First call to close one is around 10%. If you get higher than that, that's great, but that sort of benchmark for this level. You're in anywhere from the 500K to five million ARR zone, that's a hallmark of level two. And you're actually starting to think about efficiency metrics and sales metrics. You might starting to be thinking about magic number, which is a new ARR that you take in in a period divided by the CAC you spend in that period, so something in the 0.5 to 0.75 range. You want to get higher eventually, but that's pretty reasonable for this level.

(00:41:10):
You're just starting to think about retention. You've been around for a year, so you've got renewals and you want those renewals renewing. Maybe something like 10%, 20% regretted churn is okay. You don't want to be higher than that, and you want your NRR to be at least 100%. And then things like gross margin and burn multiple, they're still not the focus. Those are the classic efficiency metrics. They're not the focus right now.

(00:41:30):
But we would say you want your gross margin to be not worse than 50%, and you'd want your burn multiple to be not worse than five X. Your burn multiple, by the way, is just how much you burn in a current period versus how much new ARR comes in. So if you burn $5 million and you take in one, then you've got to burn multiple of five. And you don't want to be worse than that at this stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:51):
Amazing. There's a lot of these benchmarks which I love. I imagine not everyone's going to hit each of them exactly. These are just rough guidelines of like, "You're probably in this stage if you're in this level," right?

Todd Jackson (00:42:03):
Yeah, exactly. There's some wide bars around these metrics. It's just representative of, generally, the stage of five to 25 customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
I love it. And it's so interesting that people think of product-market fit, as you said, as this binary, "I have it or I don't." And the way you're talking about this is in this level to developing product-market fit, a company has 25 satisfied customers, they're over five million in ARR, a lot of cases they have 20 employees.

Todd Jackson (00:42:28):
Between 500K and five million. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):
500K and five million. They have 20 employees. In theory, you would think this is a roaring success. They're killing it, they have all these customers, they're growing. But it's still just level two of product-market fit. So I think this has a really interesting insight, and it reminds me of when I did a bunch of research on product-market fit.

(00:42:49):
So many founders are like, "I never felt that product-market fit. I didn't have it. It was always, 'I don't know, maybe when we get to 100 million ARR, I'll really feel like we got this.'" So I think this is a really good reminder that a lot of times you're not actually going to feel so confident this will last, and you're going to get to lasting durable product-market fit. So I think that's a really great insight here.

Todd Jackson (00:43:12):
Yeah. And the thing that's really, I think, the hallmark of level two is you've got a product that a handful of people like. It's satisfying a critical need for them. Now you've got to open the demand floodgates so that we can get to 25 customers and beyond. And different companies do this in very different ways. It's much easier said than done. Looker is an example. So Looker is a First Round company founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb. They do business intelligence. And Looker is interesting because they spent actually a long time at level one, but then flew through level two. And the reason is because Lloyd, the founder, the first five customers of Looker, he was basically going in and doing consulting for them.

(00:43:59):
And the reason is because of the nature of the product. People don't get Looker until they see their own data in it, and their data is modeled and they see the dashboards and they're like, "Oh, my God. Wow, I didn't realize these insights." So Lloyd understood Looker is not a product you could sell with Figma mock-ups. And so what happened was Lloyd would go into these customers, spend 20, 30, 40 hours before they were even a customer, modeling their data, teaching them how to use it, showing more people within the organization the power of the data and the dashboards.

(00:44:32):
And later, they called this their forward deploy process. This is how they figured out sales. And so it actually took them a long time in level one to get this right, but then they were able to do this repeatably. And so they went from five to 25 fairly quickly, and a lot of amazing... 75% close rate because they were only selling customers who were already using it. There was zero churn. And Lloyd explains once he got to 20 customers, he's like, "I know I'm onto something. And I think I figured out a model."

(00:45:03):
And the model stayed the same until they ended up selling to Google. And so they did these other things too. They started focusing on demand channels. They got a couple SDRs who were prospecting. I think they did some partner marketing with AWS Redshift. They did these look-and-tell customer events in San Francisco where they got Looker customers together to talk about what they were doing in Looker and how they built the product. But really, the groundwork was set at level one and then they moved really quickly through level two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:32):
So again, the way to think about this phase, is this is when you're starting to scale a way to drive demand. You're not just grinding sales, cold outreach. There's a way you're starting to bring in customers that are more efficient. And in Looker's case, they just started coming because I imagine there's word of mouth and people started to talk about it.

Todd Jackson (00:45:50):
Yeah. Let me do another example. A really different example is a company called Ironclad. Ironclad, it's legal. It's a legal tech company founded in 2015. Jason Jason Boehmig is the founder. AI-powered contract management software. So this was interesting because Jason, he started out calling this an AI legal assistant. And in 2024, people are like, "Oh, AI legal assistant. Yeah, that's awesome." But in 2014, people were like, "What?" And he found it really hard to sell. No one was looking for an AI legal assistant. And so he told us this story.

(00:46:29):
There was an email address on the Ironclad homepage, hello@ironclad.com. This is in 2015. And he doesn't get very much email, but Jason is checking the email. And one day he gets this one line email, and he almost archives it because he doesn't know who it's from and it's one line. But he sees that it's from a person at a publicly-traded company, and so he's like, "Oh, maybe there's something here." And the one line email is just, "Are you a CLM?" And he was like, "What is a CLM?" And he Googles for it. A CLM is a contract lifecycle management platform. And he's reading up about CLMs, and he's like, "Oh, we do that. Yeah."

(00:47:08):
And so he replies to the email, "Yes, we are a CLM." And the customer gets them on the phone. And the customer says, "Oh, I'm in the market for a CLM. I'm looking at 10 or 12 different vendors, but you guys look pretty cool because there's some automation and some AI stuff going on. Can I check this out?" And Jason's like, "Of course." So he and his co-founder take the train from San Francisco down to San Jose. And on the train, Jason is telling his co-founder, Cai, "Hey, I need you to code this up right now to make it look like what this customer is expecting."

(00:47:42):
And they get to the meeting, and they do the demo. And the customer has no idea that they just made this demo on the train, and they're a very small company. And they win the contract against these 10 or 12 other established bases, because Ironclad, it's more modern, it's automated, it's got this AI stuff. It's just a better product, or the demo looks like it's going to be a better product. And so Jason reflects on this and he's like, "Yeah, the thing for us is we had been trying to create this new category of AI legal assistant, and it was just a slog.

(00:48:10):
"And instead, when we changed our positioning to play in an existing category of CLM, but a much better CLM, but customers are already looking for a CLM, they're already looking to spend money on a CLM, and just expand the definition of what that category is, things just started to click." And that's how they got through that zone of 10, 20, 30 customers. And even if you look at the Ironclad website today, it says AI-Powered Contract Management Software. That really is the key idea still.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):
Awesome. So this is an awesome example of positioning/promise is the lever they pull here. I love the point about category design. That's one of the ongoing debates on this podcast, whether you should try to create a category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:50):
I know, it's a hot topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):
Hot topic. Sounds like you're in the boat of probably better not to create your own category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:56):
I think it's hard to create a category. It certainly works in some cases, but if you actually have a really interesting spin on an existing category, there's already buyers spending money on that thing. They're already looking for something to buy. So if you can do it, I do actually think that way is easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):
Before we get to level three, what are signs that you're maybe stuck at level two, and what should one do about that?

Todd Jackson (00:49:21):
Yeah. So the whole idea of level two is this thing that the marginal customer is getting easier. And so you've got to be focusing on demand and the repeatability of demand while you maintain satisfaction. So the yellow flags are things that are the opposite of that. Your current customers are pretty happy, but you're just having trouble opening the floodgates. As you're getting to the top end of level two, you should start to hear some startups know who you are like, "Oh, you need a SOC 2, you're a startup. Oh, Vanta." "Oh, you need AI-powered contract management software. Oh, Ironclad." You start to get known for a thing.

(00:49:59):
And so if you're having trouble opening those floodgates, and you're sitting there for, I don't know, 12 months, 18 months, that's a problem. Or you have things like your regretted churn is greater than 20%. That's a satisfaction warning sign. And again, you have to maintain the satisfaction as you work on these other things. Every level just gets more things you have to do. Or you could be finding that the sales cycle's taking too long, you're losing deals late in the funnel, you're losing the competitors. You're just not feeling the urgency from customers or you're struggling to hit the price point that you want.

(00:50:33):
And the way that customers will say this to you because customers are nice, right? They'll say, "Oh, we don't have the budget." Or, "Oh, it's just not the right time for us. We'd love to talk again next year." That means no, when you're hearing that from customers. You want customers who are like, "Oh, of course. Yeah, this is expensive, but I'm going to make this work because I need this." And so if you're seeing any of those signs, those are the signs that you maybe are stuck or plateauing at this level. And I really think it's important to think about the four Ps and think about: how am I going to pivot my way out of this? Jack Altman, who I mentioned earlier from Lattice, he's got a great quote on this.

(00:51:14):
It's up in a video on the website. What did he say? He said, "Most founders do a 10% pivot, and what they need to be doing is a 200% pivot." Jack didn't say this, but I think part of my interpretation of this is it's psychologically hard as a founder. You've gotten to this many customers, you're starting to plateau, but you're like, "I don't want to throw this whole thing away." But you have to be willing to let go and really focus on nailing the four Ps at this point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
And in your experience, do you find, essentially, pivoting is the answer if you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (00:51:52):
I think sometimes it's nice when it's the Ironclad thing, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:56):
Yeah.

Todd Jackson (00:51:57):
It's nicest when it's the Looker thing of you don't have to change anything. It just starts working and basically, the whole thing works the whole time. That's not common. It's nice when it's the Ironclad thing when you just change one of them, or maybe two of them. Starting over with all four of these is hard at level two, but oftentimes, it's what's required. I was mentioning earlier, level two is the second most common level to get stuck.

(00:52:20):
A big chunk of companies are going to get stuck at level one, and the second biggest is at level two. So sometimes it's hard. I think the trap is not doing enough to realize that you're actually not progressing to product-market fit in the way that you need to and just starting to burn money and not make progress. And you've seen many startups struggle with this. I think it's the hardest part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):
Yeah. Especially once they're a million, two million, three million ARR and they're like, "Look, we're making all this money." And they don't necessarily realize that they've been stuck at this stage for so long. So just to summarize flags that something is wrong and that you should probably think about changing your persona, your problem, your promise or your product, is it's been 12 to 18 months at this stage of product-market fit. You are churning about 20% of customers. And these are logo churn, I imagine, just like businesses stop using you.

Todd Jackson (00:53:14):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):
Your sales cycles are really slow. Is there a sense of what slow means? Just a rough heuristic. What should it...

Todd Jackson (00:53:20):
Well, some sales cycles are slow. If you're selling to companies that are big, you're selling to government, that type of thing. I don't know. Rough rule of thumb is... There's different ACVs also. If you're the kind of product that is 20K, 30K annual contracts, that was Looker, right? But they were able to do the sales cycle very repeatedly because they closed so often. There are some contracts that are 100K, 200K, six figure contracts. Those can take a long time. Those can take three to six months. You can't basically be in the worst of both worlds where you've got a slow sales cycle and a low ACV. That is the quadrant of death basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Awesome. Okay. And then the other sign is just you're not finding demand starting to come to you. You're not finding a channel to drive demand. And is a big part of this inbound? You're supposed to start seeing more inbound coming at you? Or is it more just sales becomes easier?

Todd Jackson (00:54:12):
It's both. So sales becomes easier, but I think if you are starting to get to level three, which is where we're getting to next, you've probably got 10%, 20% of your inbound coming or completely organic inbound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):
Awesome. Okay. So again, if you're stuck at this stage, and these are signs that are like, "Oh, man, this sounds familiar," your advice is find one of these things to shift the person you're going after, the problem you're solving, the way you position it and/or your product if you have to.

Todd Jackson (00:54:41):
Yeah. And probably just look for something that is a lot more of a burning pain. It's usually that the problem is not significant enough, important enough to people, or the promise is not valuable enough. It's usually one of those [inaudible 00:54:54] assuming you have a reasonable persona.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:56):
Awesome. And the reason I am spending so much time here, as you said, most companies get stuck here, like B2B SaaS companies. So I think it's really important to make sure people have something to go with. And in the course and in the post you put out, there's more examples of companies going through this and what they did. Let's talk about level three. What does level three look like? What should you be focusing on there?

Todd Jackson (00:55:16):
Yeah. So level three is strong product-market fit. This is where I think it starts to get fun. This is where all the product-market fit adages come in, "The fish are jumping into the boat. The rock is rolling down the hill and I'm trying to chase it instead of pushing it up the hill." And keep in mind, for most enterprise founders, we're now three, four or five years into the company, so it's not easy to get here. And to get to L3 here, you are looking for repeatability. The marginal customer has become much easier.

(00:55:48):
And so you mentioned, Lenny, this quote from David Hsu from Retool, which I love too, and I'll read it again. He said, "We talked to someone who said that finding product-market fit was so visceral, you immediately felt it like a geyser." And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years. At Retool, every customer we got, whether that was number four or number 14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt like rolling the stone uphill, and if you stop pushing, it's going to roll back on you and crush you.

(00:56:15):
And that's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR. That's when the boulder went down the other side and we had to chase it to keep up. And you mentioned earlier, founders were like, "I'm not sure I ever felt product-market fit." This is when you start to feel it. And Jack Altman, again, from Lattice said, "The biggest shift was in the ease of getting leads." I remember thinking, "I don't even know where these leads are coming from, just more and more of them are showing up each month."

(00:56:43):
But that is a great feeling. That is a great feeling. Filip Kaliszan from Verkada, he's in some of the videos on our website too. His quote, I'll read it, was, "After our first year of sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up with production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to happen in the span of 12 to 18 months in order to deliver on everything that customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. And that in itself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey."

(00:57:11):
So the benchmarks when you are at level three are now you're probably 30 to 100 people inside your company. You're probably at Series B-ish territory in terms of venture, maybe late Series A, maybe early Series C, but probably around Series B. You've really cracked a demand channel. You've cracked marketing and sales. You've got at least one channel that is very scalable. And probably 10% or more of your inbound is coming from just referrals and word of mouth and you're getting known, like we talked about.

(00:57:45):
ACV ranges are very high. Very wide, I should say. I'd say where you want to get to with level three is 100 customers. And so if you're approaching 100 customers and maybe you have 75K average ACV, that would be strong. You're in this wide zone of five million, all the way up to 25 million ARR. That is very level three. And you're actually starting now to think about some of these efficiency metrics. Remember, we've been punting efficiency. We were saying it shouldn't be worse than a certain number, but it's not a focus. Now, it's got to come into focus.

(00:58:20):
Because the way that we get to level four is we keep ripping on the satisfaction and the demand, and we tune this thing to get very efficient. So we're talking about our gross margin needs to be above 60%, hopefully above 70%. Our burn multiple is now below three. Ideally, we're close to one. Burn multiple in the one to three zone is where we want to be at level three. Regretted churn's less than 10%, NRR is greater than 110%. These are good benchmarks for this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
Hearing level three again tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding customers, selling, pitching, constantly trying to find new people, to level three, where it's coming at you and basically, it's the way you always hear about it, as you described. It's rolling downhill. Fish are jumping in the boat. I haven't heard that one before, but I love this.

(00:59:11):
So essentially, you found a demand channel. You found a way to get people to come to you. A lot of them are just hearing about you from other people, you don't even know where they're coming from. 10% you said are coming from referrals and you're getting to 100 customers. I actually have another quote from David Hsu at Retool, and he actually said even at 100 customers, he still felt like every customer he was getting was the last one.

Todd Jackson (00:59:33):
Oh, wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
He's like, "I can't believe we got DoorDash. That's incredible. Okay. I think there's no more. That's it."

Todd Jackson (00:59:39):
He is a critical person and critical of himself, but a very high expectations person, let's say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:43):
Yeah. Actually, another quote from Ali Ghodsi from Databricks actually said even at 100 million, he wasn't sure they had product-market fit.

Todd Jackson (00:59:50):
I mean, come on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Because he's like, "I don't know." I don't know. He felt like, "This is it. Okay, we're done. We're going to cap out here." And I get that.

Todd Jackson (00:59:58):
I think if you told many, many pre-seed founders that they'd be able to get to 100 million and not know whether they had product-market fit, they'd probably take that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):
But I think that's maybe an interesting insight. It's often good to be really paranoid and not feel like, "Okay, we're on our way. Let's start pouring in money. Let's do it."

Todd Jackson (01:00:13):
I think that's what makes a lot of the best founders the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Indeed. Okay, so level three, anything else that would be useful here? Maybe what are signs that you're struggling at level three, you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (01:00:25):
Yeah. So level three problems. And again, it's hard to get to level three, so awesome work for getting here. But the problems that might start to emerge are you've got a leaky bucket, your NRR is below 90%, or your regretted churn's greater than 10%. Maybe growth is just slowing down. You grew three X each of the prior two years, but you're struggling to do a two X this year. At level three, or five years into the company or so, there's probably a lot of competition. If you've gotten here, you've got something that's working, and people are starting to notice and there's going to be competitors.

(01:01:01):
And they could be the big competitors, they could be the new startups, but you're going to have to figure out how to navigate probably a tougher market than you entered five years ago. And so maybe you found your first scalable channel, but it's getting saturated, you got to find a new channel. These are the level three problems. Or you're growing, but like I said, with efficiency, you're spending too much money to grow. So you feel like, "Okay, yeah, we can grow at three X year over year, two X year over year, but that's going to push our burn multiple above three again." And that's a little bit of a pickle to be in when you have to trade off growth and spend like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):
You make it sound like life's great, level three people are coming at us. I think it's important to note never is it easy, never is it like, "Okay, we're good. Let's just ride this wave. Life's going to get so much easier from now on." It's never easy. As you said, there's all these things, you're always still juggling, you still aren't sure it's going to keep going.

Todd Jackson (01:01:55):
No, I agree. It's like you're spinning plates, and the higher levels you get, there's more plates. You have to keep spinning. And so at level three and getting to level four, we've got to maintain satisfaction and demand. We cannot let them regress in a market that's getting harder, and we have to really start focusing on efficiency. And the companies that can maintain satisfaction and demand and continue to grow and become really efficient, now we're at level four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Let's talk about level four. What does that look like? What are some problems people run into there?

Todd Jackson (01:02:26):
So first of all, congrats. If you get to level four, you have a valuable company. You are probably already a unicorn, and you're starting to think about, "Can I become a decacorn?" And so you've reached the highest levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. And so the benchmarks at level four are like, "Okay, now your team is probably bigger than 100 people, you're Series C, Series D or beyond. You've got more than 100 customers and you're starting to figure out, 'How do I get to 200, 300, eventually 1,000 customers?'" You're beyond 25 million in ARR, so 25 million and up, I think in ARR, it qualifies as level four. And your other metrics are looking really good too. Your sales conversion first call to close one is probably better than 15%, your magic number is greater than one, your tax payback is less than 12 months.

(01:03:13):
All these things are super awesome. And finally, now you've got your gross margin above 80%. Your burn multiple's ideally less than one at this point, you've got less than 10% churn. You've got greater than 120% NRR. And so now the whole thing is like, "Well, how do I keep growing?" This thing's gotten pretty big. And this is generally when we get to 100 million, especially and beyond, the stage that founders are thinking about, "How do I keep growing by expanding TAM, by expanding total addressable market?" And to expand TAM, I can usually take my product and bring it into new markets, or I start to think about multiple products as a way to expand TAM.

(01:03:55):
And so this is where you see all the truly great companies, the legendary companies are all able to do that. Vanta has begun to do this. They have the Vanta trust management platform, they've got security questionnaires, they've got vendor risk management. So they're starting to do this. You think of Verkada, who I mentioned before. They started with cloud security cameras, now they do alarms, now they do smoke detectors, now they do badge readers. Stripe has classic Stripe, but they've got Stripe Radar, Stripe Atlas. Square has the Square Stand, Cash App, Square Checking, Square Loans. All the companies that are tens of billions of dollars of value have figured out a way to do this. And it's like the never-ending journey that you said before, Lenny. Like, "Congrats, you got to level four."

(01:04:40):
But there's just this endless thirst for continued growth. And the interesting thing about that is that it requires finding product-market fit over and over again. Just because you got to level four on your main product doesn't mean product-market fit is free on all these new products. And you've been inside Airbnb and I've been inside Dropbox and Twitter. Getting new products to be successful is hard and it requires this mindset of like, "Yeah, we've got a little bit of advantage because people know who we are, and we have a customer set that hopefully we can layer on new products to. But it's not easy." You have to get into this mindset of product-market fit is never easy, and if we want to continue to grow, we got to find it again and again and maintain that mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
Casey Winters has this great point also that expectations of customers ever increase. And so you have product-market fit today, but there's going to be better products coming out, they're changing, the world changes. And so not only do you have to worry about competitors, there's just expectations continue to rise. So it's a never-ending battle. To give people a little bit of a broader sense here, what percentage of companies do you find make it through each of these stages in your experience, what are rough numbers you may have in your head?

Todd Jackson (01:05:52):
The majority of companies, so greater than 50%, probably closer to 60 or 70%, are going to get stuck at L1 or L2. And so that leaves, roughly, let's say, 30% make it to L3 or L4 just in our experience looking broadly. And that's our entire goal. Because again, once you get to L3, you've got a real shot, you've got a real shot at building an awesome company. And so if we get that number, help founders get that number above 30%, imagine if that was 50/50 and half the companies that we were working with at seed were able to get to level three strong product-market fit. I think that would be epic. And I think our founders would... There'd be incredible benefits to the ecosystem from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Okay. So essentially, 60% ish of companies don't make it past L2. And I love the way you're framing it of just, "If we can just get a few more companies further, that makes a massive dent both in the world and the lives of founders and people that want to use products." Another question I wanted to talk about briefly is just again, the timelines of each of these levels. Just in your rough experience, how long do each of these levels roughly take so people can get a sense of like, "Oh, it's taken a lot longer. Maybe there's a problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:07:10):
So again, this whole thing probably takes four to six years, and so let's just pick five years as the number to get to level four. I think the way this works, ideally, is you probably take 12 to 18 months to do level one, because that is the most important level, honestly, in my mind because that's where you're really choosing the right persona and the right problem to focus on. And I think just that choice is one of the most important choices that founders make. And the interesting thing, my partner, Josh Kopelman, talks about this all the time, is that founders spend 99% of their time building because that's what they've done.

(01:07:53):
And they spend 1% of their time picking, in picking the market, picking the problem, picking the customer. And in reality, it's that pick that determines the constraints and the boundaries of where you're going to be working for the next, hopefully, 10 years of your life. So there's a real imbalance there. And I actually think that that pick is the most important thing. So I would actually like to spend, let's say, somewhere 12 to 18 months in level one, just really figuring that out and figuring out my four Ps. And then, hopefully, I move very quickly. It takes me a while to get to my first five satisfied customers, but they love it.

(01:08:28):
And then I go quickly through L2, maybe that takes about a year. This is like the Looker path, the happy path. And then L3 is long just because we're going all the way from five million in revenue up to 25, and that might take a year or two, probably two years even in a good case. And then getting from 25 to 100 million is hard, obviously very hard. And then that probably takes a couple years. And then you're figuring out all of these things.

(01:08:53):
You're growing your team and your company's got a lot more moving parts and functions, and there's a demand generation side of the house and sales and there's engineering and the whole thing just gets more complicated with a lot more people. But I think that if you set the foundation really nicely at level one and level two that hopefully the whole thing... The boulder is rolling down the hill and it's carrying you forward and you don't just feel like you're pushing this rock uphill for five years. That's not a fun place to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:22):
There's a lot of founders in that place and I know a few, so this is really interesting. So you're roughly saying that maybe spend a year, year and a half on level one, which is you're just grinding, cold emailing, reaching out, selling customers, and maybe getting to five customers in the first year and a half. That's at the extreme, but that's a good outcome. And then maybe another year trying to get to... What was it? 20? 25 customers.

Todd Jackson (01:09:45):
Going from five to 25 quickly. Yeah, if I see a company go from five customers to 25 in a year, that is almost always a sign that there's some pretty strong product-market fit there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:56):
Awesome. So many companies don't go through that, and they have the funding to keep iterating, exploring, trying to figure things out. I don't know if you have the answer here, but just what's your advice of if it's been four years and demand is not starting to come to them, they don't have 25 customers? Is it, "Wait until you run out of money, just give it a shot"? Or is it, "Let's just give the money back and move on to something else"?

Todd Jackson (01:10:21):
Well, that's a personal decision for founders. I do think if you've been going at it for four to five years and you haven't started to find anything that you're really feeling pull from the market on, I don't know, you've done it for four to five years, what are the chances that you're going to magically find something? I think there are probably a handful of startups that do it that figure it out and get back on an amazing growth curve, but that's the exception rather than the rule.

(01:10:46):
So if a founder wants to return the money to investors, if a founder wants to look for a soft landing, there's no shame in that. Product-market fit is very, very hard. That's why we're doing this. It's why we're trying to increase the odds. And we're also trying to make it clear what it looks like and what it doesn't look like. And everybody knows when they do a startup that the odds are that you will not get there. So there's no shame in that, and I would completely be supportive of any founder who wants to take that path.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):
I love that advice. I think that was a really important point to make. Let's quickly summarize the levels and then I want to also summarize the four Ps again, because I think that's the thing you can actually do. And so I think I just want to reinforce, "Here's the four things you should play with if things aren't going in the direction." So first of all, let's summarize the levels, what it looks like and what you should be focusing on there.

Todd Jackson (01:11:38):
Okay. So level one, nascent product-market fit. You're just trying to get three to five customers and you're focused on satisfaction first and foremost. Level two is developing. This is where you're going from five to 25 customers, and you're really starting to focus on demand. Level three is strong product-market fit. You're going from 25 customers up to 100 or more, and you've got to start thinking about efficiency at that scale. And then level four is extreme, you're more than 100 customers, your company's awesome. You got to keep doing all three of those things well, and you have to start looking for ways to expand your total addressable market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):
Okay, perfect. And then let's come back to the four Ps. I have the draft. I have your post up here, so I have the detailed version of each of these things. But could you just talk through these four things? What is it you should be thinking about changing if things aren't working, the four Ps basically?

Todd Jackson (01:12:30):
Yeah. So the four Ps again are: persona, problem, promise, and product. And the persona is interesting because in some ways, it's synonymous with the market. A lot of people think of the market in this macroeconomic way where it's like, "Oh, it's this category of ERP software or whatever." I think it's much more tangible for a founder to think of the market as a collection of people. Jack Altman was thinking about his market as all of the HR leaders out there, and he was thinking about how many of them are there and what are the problems they have and how much money are they willing to spend on solving those problems.

(01:13:12):
It's a collection of people who have money to pay for a product or pay for a service. And so that's really the first piece, find the persona and really try to get into the mind of the persona. That's another thing I was amazed about spending time with Zach from Plaid, and Lloyd from Looker, and Jack from Lattice. They had all of these people, they were text messaging with all of their customers and they're meeting them on the weekends and stuff. They really, really knew their customer well. They were friends with their customers.

(01:13:45):
And so you've got to get so deep into the mind of the persona and: what are their challenges? What are their goals? How do you help them succeed at their job? That's the stuff that earns you the right to get the rest of the Ps right. And so the problem, obviously, comes next. And I think about this, and I can actually get into, Lenny, a little bit if you want to get into some of the customer discovery stuff because that's the second session.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
Perfect segue.

Todd Jackson (01:14:14):
And I was talking a little bit about we think of it as dollar-driven customer discovery. And I think a lot of founders are familiar with customer discovery. I think they at least talk to customers, which is good. I don't think most of them do it in the highest signal way because again, the customers, they're people, they're nice, they're going to be polite. They're also not good at predicting things that they will use or buy or want.

(01:14:41):
They're very good at talking about their problems, but they're not necessarily good at predicting their own behavior. So we think about it in terms of dollar-driven discovery, which is how do you test the dollar potential of a hypothesis? And this is a whole two-hour session, but I'll try to do it briefly here just to give you a sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):
No, let's get into it. Let's keep going. I'm just joking.

Todd Jackson (01:15:02):
So you've got to identify extreme value. This is independent of what I'm building, Lenny. I want to hear about your problems and your challenges and what is most important to you. And so I need to do it in this non-leading way and I need to avoid the trap that we call happy years. Because I found a lot of founders, "I want to build this thing, I want you to like my thing." And so I look for the things that you say that support what I'm doing. That's the trap. And so I could just try it on you, Lenny. Yeah, I might say...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):
Let's do it.

Todd Jackson (01:15:36):
Okay, Lenny, so you're doing Lenny's Newsletter and you're building Lenny's Podcasts. When you think about we're sitting here in April, over the next three months, let's say, what are your top three goals for Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:53):
Oh, wow, interesting. I'm trying to find a more scalable way to do this newsletter long-term. It's basically something I have to do for the rest of my life, in theory. I don't know if there's an exit path for this newsletter career, so I'm trying to find ways to scale this over time. That's one. Two is just up-leveling the quality of each podcast episode in terms of visuals and audio and trailers and things like that. And then three is make the community more valuable to everyone that listens that's in the newsletter community. Those are top of mind.

Todd Jackson (01:16:26):
Okay, awesome. And so what's hard about those three things? You said you want to scale the newsletter, you want to increase quality, you want to make the community awesome. What's hard about those things? Or what's standing in your way of doing those?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:39):
I don't have the answer yet, I guess is the answer. I don't know exactly how to do this yet.

Todd Jackson (01:16:44):
You don't know how to do it. Okay. It's probably a service in this case, not a product. What if I was able to give you a service that said, "Lenny, you're going to be able to scale this podcast. We are going to help you find the 500 best guests in the world that are really excellent. We're going to guarantee they show up. You're going to have endless content on your podcast, in your newsletter"? What do you think about that? What do you think about that idea?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:16):
I'd pay a lot of money for that.

Todd Jackson (01:17:18):
Okay. So that's an example of a wow statement. And you probably had in the back of your mind, "How are you going to do that? Is that actually going to work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
That's right.

Todd Jackson (01:17:28):
In my experience, that's a good thing and an exciting thing. If I'm pitching a product idea to somebody and they are like, "Wow, does that really work? And if that thing works, I'd sign up for the wait list today." That to me is like, "Okay, now I got to figure out how to build that thing, but I know if I am able to build it and deliver on that promise, they are going to want it." Or you would maybe say signs like you would demonstrate a behavior that shows that you're interested in. You'd be like, "Oh, Todd, can we meet again next week to talk about this?" Or like, "Hey Todd, I actually would love to show this to the people I work with. Can you send me the deck?"

(01:18:06):
Those are the signs that I'm looking for. If you had reacted like, "Yeah, that sounds kind of interesting," that's a no, right? That is a no. The word interesting is a polite way of saying no, right? And so I'm either looking for wow statements or I'm looking for demonstrated behavior that shows interest. I then would probably, if I want to keep going with this, and this is all in the identifying extreme value, I'd ask you, "Well, what stands out as valuable here to you?" And I want to hear you answer quickly. You mentioned it's either going to make my products so much better, it's going to drive success for my business, or it's going to save me a bunch of money or something. Save me a bunch of risk." But something where you would very quickly be able to identify why that's valuable to you.

(01:18:51):
So that part one is extreme value. Then I got to figure out ability to pay and willingness to pay. And for you, this is easy because you're not a 5,000 person company and you're the boss. So this is probably pretty streamlined. There's no procurement function at Lenny's Newsletter. So let's say I'm going after a bigger company. The questions I'd ask on confirming the ability to pay are: are you currently looking for a product like this? Or are you building something internally?

(01:19:24):
This is the Ironclad thing where Jason was like, "Oh, you're looking for a CLM already." Another way I think about it is if a customer has a problem, and I really think they have a problem, and they know they have the problem and they're looking for a solution for the problem. Or they've even tried to build their own solution to it and failed, that's the best customer. They want this thing badly. They've demonstrated that and they've actually failed at building it because they underestimated how hard it was. So are you currently looking for building a solution here?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):
Essentially, there's a budget. You're looking for, "Is there money to go towards this problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:20:01):
That's the next question I was going to say is where would a budget for this come from? And the best answer is that there's an existing budget. Either we already spend money in some way for a competing tool, or something that can be displaced by you, or we're spending, we put five engineers together to help build this thing. There's some source of budget that I can get. Then the question is, "Well, how does your team make decisions on third-party tools to bring on?" And you're never going to get the cleanest answer here. In larger companies, you might get semi-clean answers, but it's something like, "Okay, this manager can approve it directly up to a certain dollar amount. If not, it goes to this next level up of manager. And if we're going to spend more than 50K on it, we actually have to compare three different alternatives."

(01:20:47):
But whatever, there's some known process. That's what I'm looking for rather than just a bunch of ambiguity. So that's ability to pay. And then I'm going into willingness to pay. I don't want to try to quantify that. That's where I go, "What's your budget for solving this? What are you paying for this other tool? Let me show you mine. You think that you'd pay less for that or you'd pay more for that? Can you replace this other thing with the thing I have?" And then I love this question. I think you've had Madhavan Ramanujam on the show, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
Mm-hmm.

Todd Jackson (01:21:17):
He has this question, he's from Simon-Kucher. I love his thing of like, "Lenny, what is a fair price you would pay for this thing that I just described to you?" And then you say your thing. And then I go, "Okay. Well, what would be an expensive price?" And then I say, "Okay, what would be a prohibitively expensive price?" And you ask those three questions. And generally, when people tell you the fair price, it's a little bit of like they're trying to get a deal. And if the product's good, the expensive price is the one that they would actually pay.

(01:21:47):
Where they're saying it feels expensive, but you put it in front of them, and you say, "It costs this much," and if it's really good, they want it. And the prohibitively expensive one is the one that's too expensive and they'd have to just, "I just can't do that." So I love these style of questions. I think they're just a lot more specific than what I see most founders doing, which is just chatting with customers. You really want to try to put them to some questions where you know they're going to answer honestly because you're asking them questions. You're not asking them to speculate and you're asking them fairly concrete stuff.

(01:22:18):
Oh, and the thing I should say is it's a two-hour session, like I mentioned. It's one thing to explain this stuff, but it's another thing to see it. And so we show tons of Zoom recordings from founders who have gone through the program, and we actually do this thing where all the founders who are going through the program, they recorded all their videos, their customer discovery videos, and then our team watches all of the videos and creates highlight reels.

(01:22:45):
And we sit around in a room and watch them together and we say like, "Oh, look at these questions that Lenny asked. And did you see how the customer responded? Wow, that's an eyes-light-up moment." Or, "Todd asked these questions, he's leading the witness a little bit and the customer didn't seem that interested." So the thing that's interesting is as a founder, you never see anybody else's version of this. You only have your own experience. And so just seeing how other founders do this in a real live setting is super. People love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):
And it's always easy to hear these things. It's much harder to be the person asking these questions to a potential customer you're trying to sell. And it's just asking, "How much would you pay for this?" So I love that you kind of force people through the actual practice of it. Todd, you're going to get a lot of applicants for this program. This sounds amazing. I know you're giving a peek at the stuff that we haven't really talked about. On this point you just shared, which is essentially trying to get real skin in the game insight into how big of a problem this is, I love that you just basically shared a bunch of questions.

(01:23:43):
Someone could just rewind right now and just write down all these questions that you shared and use them when you're talking to customers. Obviously, the classic problem is they tell you they're going to buy it but they don't. And all the stuff you shared is, "Here's ways to get at: will they actually buy it before they have the actual product?" Is there anything else you want to say on that? Just tips for not being tricked and people just saying, "Oh, yeah, I love this thing"? I know you talked through a lot of this, but anything else?

Todd Jackson (01:24:06):
Yeah, I think there's a couple of things. One is you have to know what to show people when you're actually showing them something. Lattice is the kind of product I mentioned that could be sold with Figma mock-ups. Looker couldn't be sold that way. Looker, you actually had to do a demo with their real data. So it required a lot more work to do that. Vanta was neither like a demo or a mock-up, it was actually doing the work. And Pilot was like that. There's a bunch of companies like that. So you have to figure out what is my product and how does it solve the problem? And therefore, what fidelity does my early product or early demo have to be at in order to land the sale?

(01:24:44):
And then I think you have to know when you've talked to enough people. It takes time to talk to people. And the rule of thumb is if you talk to enough people and you can predict 70 to 80% of what the next person is going to say to you, because you've just talked to so many people and you've heard the pattern so clearly, that's when you've talked to enough people. But these are all things you got to learn. And that's why doing it experientially in the way that we do the program we think was best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Is there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to touch on before we let you go?

Todd Jackson (01:25:15):
No. If you're listening, if you're a B2B founder in those early days of starting your company, or you know anyone who fits that description, and you have an appreciation for just how hard it is to find product-market fit and you don't want to go it alone, then please apply to this program or share the application. Like we promise, we will review every single application. And I'm just really looking forward to working with a group of 20 or so amazing founders, and helping them navigate these early days of product-market fit finding. It's what I love to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:43):
So just to make sure the right people apply, remind people who is a great fit. So it's B2B founders, and you said they've been at it for six to nine months, something like that?

Todd Jackson (01:25:52):
Yeah, something in that zone or earlier. You have an idea of what your product is. You have a hypothesis about what it is and who it's for, but you probably haven't started writing any code yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:01):
And if they've been at it for four years and haven't found success, this is not a fit.

Todd Jackson (01:26:07):
I could try to help them one-on-one, but no, that's not a fit for this program.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:10):
And then how do they apply and when are their applications due?

Todd Jackson (01:26:13):
Yeah. So you go to pmf.firstround.com. Applications are open. They're going to go till May 7th, and then the program starts on May 29th. And if you want to reach out to me specifically, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @tjack, T-J-A-C-K. You can follow me, DM me. And yeah, I'm looking forward to working with some amazing founders that I know are listening right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:34):
Amazing. I'm so happy we did this. I feel like this conversation is going to help a ton of founders, and they're going to come back to it again and again. Todd, thank you so much for being here.

Todd Jackson (01:26:43):
Lenny, it's been a pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:44):
It's been my pleasure. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

# Billion dollar failures, and billion dollar success | Tom Conrad (Quibi, Pandora, Pets.com, Zero)

## Transcript

Tom Conrad (00:00:00):
There's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. I think, in some ways, our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. There's an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere. That would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has a mathematical formula that's going to win on any metric. Whatever metric you care about. You want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Speaker 1 (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Tom Conrad. Tom was an engineer at Apple, CTO of Pandora, which he helped take from zero to 80 million users. He's also VP of product at Snap, where he was the right-hand man to Evan Spiegel for two years. He's been on the Board of Sonos for over seven years. He was also part of two infamous product failures, Quibi, where he was chief product officer, which raised over $2 billion and died less than a year after launch.

(00:01:17):
He was also a senior engineering leader at Pets.com, which famously went from nothing to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months. Today, Tom is the CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is on a mission to extend the lifespan and the health span of the human race. In our conversation, we dig into what Tom's learned from these famous product failures, also, what he's learned from the many product successes. Tom also shares what he's learned about how to pick where to go work and what to avoid. How important understanding the math formula of the business model is. Also, lessons on burnout and health and leadership and contrarian corner. With that, I bring you Tom Conrad, after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:01):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates.

(00:02:25):
Within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKI process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down.

(00:02:52):
Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars startup credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

Speaker 1 (00:03:17):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.

(00:03:44):
With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Tom, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tom Conrad (00:04:44):
Thank you. It's so fun that I get to be a part of this.

Lenny (00:04:46):
I thought it'd be fun to start with a story about your time at Apple and you building this now very ubiquitous feature of dragging and dropping something into a folder. Which I saw you tweet about or talk about at a talk and the fact that it's still around. Can you just share that story and maybe a lesson from that experience that you've taken away?

Tom Conrad (00:05:05):
Sure. Let's see. I was 15 years old when the Macintosh came out. I remember really clearly my entire teenage years. All I wanted to do was to move from Columbus, Ohio to Cupertino and work for Apple. My heroes were that team of people that had written their signatures on the inside of the Macintosh. We cracked open the first Macintosh case. You would find the signatures of the 20 people or so who worked on the Mac. That was my only ambition, truly.

(00:05:40):
This was a period where no one wanted to work for Apple. That wasn't a thing. It seems like maybe a little obvious today, but it wasn't an obvious ambition at all back then. Anyway, I went to college. It's all I wanted to do. Studied computer engineering at University of Michigan, and as we talk about my career, it is just over and over and over. I'm going to say an incredibly lucky thing happened. The first incredibly lucky thing that happened for me in my career probably was that University of Michigan happened to be a place that Apple recruited from.

(00:06:08):
I didn't know that when I chose the school, but it made it reasonably easy to connect to a hiring manager at Apple. I wrote an actual letter and put it in an actual envelope and put it in the mail and got an internship and drove out in my dad's Pontiac from the Midwest to California. Spent a summer interning and my last day of the internship, I was thinking about really what I wanted to do when I came back. Hopefully came back to Apple after I graduated.

(00:06:39):
I had worked on a product that became shipped. It was called the QuickDraw GX. It was earlier second generation rendering system for the Mac. I'd been that team's intern for the summer. But what I really wanted to do is I wanted to work on the Finder. This is the only thing in the whole world I really wanted to do. I went and found Ron Lichty, who is the manager of the Finder team and said, "I graduate in 10 months. I'd love to be a part of your team."

(00:07:06):
I think he was like, why are you coming and talking to me now? You're literally going back to Michigan tomorrow. I go back to Michigan in May, the phone rings and Ron says, "The college recruiting department just told me that I have a college hiring rep and if I don't use it by tomorrow, I lose it." He's like, "I can't even interview you, you can't meet the team, but you're basically a freebie for me. Do you want this job?"

(00:07:38):
Just insanely lucky moment, got this job. I get to Apple in the summer of 1992 and I have a laundry list of things that I would like to do to make the Finder more usable. I remember sitting in Ron's office and saying, "At the grocery store, when you're carrying bags of groceries out, the door's automatically open for you? I think the Finder should do the same thing. When you're dragging an icon around and you want to put it in a folder, you should be able to hover maybe over the folder icons and drill down into the file system to get to where you're going.

(00:08:20):
Then when you drop the file, all of the folders that opened up between you and your source and your destination would close for you." Ron thought that was a fine idea, so that was the way Apple worked in those days. I just went off and started coding that up. I got to the point late one night, two in the morning at Apple, no one else was there, where I needed some kind of animation to indicate that the folder was about to open.

(00:08:48):
I'm certainly not an animator and I certainly wasn't going to do anything thoughtful in the middle of the night. I just wrote some code that blinked the folder, like selected unselected, selected unselected five times and thought, oh, I'll email one of the really talented visual designers to do something much more interesting. Long story short, apple finally shipped that feature four years later. Sat in the source code repository forever while we did other things.

(00:09:21):
When it shipped four years later, it blinked five times. Roll the clock forward six or seven years, Mac plus 10 comes out, entirely new Finder rewritten from scratch. No spring-loaded folders anywhere to be seen. People complained about it. It got re-implemented. All of the code, brand new. Folder blinks five times when you hover over it. Roll the clock forward another decade, IOS comes along and they added folders. When you drag an icon around, it blinks a few times.

(00:09:51):
I'm not sure what the point of this story is other than maybe it's something about, I think we all do this as designers and product people. We take these shortcuts that we think that we'll go back later and clean up. Sometimes, it's literally been 30 years that little design detail lingers three implementations later and now it's just a part of the way that these Apple products work. Pretty bizarre.

Lenny (00:10:16):
As you were talking, I'm on a Mac right now recording this and I just did it just to make sure it's still there and it is indeed still there. I think it blinks three times and then just opens up for you.

Tom Conrad (00:10:25):
There you go.

Lenny (00:10:26):
Full engineers got royalties on features they build that continue to live on in our product.

Tom Conrad (00:10:30):
Okay, I'll tell you just one other little thing to center you in time about what the Finder was like in 1992. We didn't get royalties, but our names were in the About box. You would go to About the Finder and the seven of us, there were seven engineers at Apple that worked on The Finder. Our names would scroll by the Finder, copyright 1992, yada, yada, yada, one name after another. Totally different era.

Lenny (00:10:55):
It feels like you got what you wanted with the name scribbled on the motherboard.

Tom Conrad (00:10:59):
For sure. I've gotten a lot of the things I wanted as a kid.

Lenny (00:11:05):
Along the same lines, I want to talk a bit about picking where to go work. Clearly you had a sense you wanted to go work at Apple. Over your career, you've landed at a lot of really successful places. You've also landed at a lot of very famous failures that we're going to talk about. What advice would you give people for helping them pick where to go work based on your experience?

Tom Conrad (00:11:25):
When I was a kid, my ambition to work at Apple was entirely about the product, so probably that version of me would say, find a product that you're passionate about and go spend your time and energy on that thing. Pretty quickly you learn that an awful lot of your development and day-to-day satisfaction really comes from the people that you get to collaborate with. Can you learn from them? Do you like them? Do they challenge you in the right ways?

(00:11:53):
Do they give you latitude in the right ways? It's so much about not just what, but who. For a very long time, my advice would've been entirely in the category of life, find something that you love with people that you think are amazing and the rest will take care of itself. Interestingly, I have been lucky enough to have some things that were successful on the metrics, get talked about the most, big audiences, big financial return, et cetera, et cetera. I've also worked on some things that were really notable disasters. When I look back on my career and think about the things that I've done, my professional satisfaction is not well correlated with those external metrics and very, very coordinated with do I love the thing we were building and do I love the people I was working with?

Lenny (00:12:43):
Following the thread of the people. I think one of the hardest things is really knowing what the people are like until you join. I think as a chief product officer joining or VP of product, you have a lot of time that you spend with the team. Most people don't. They have an interview and then they're like, all right, I got to make a decision. Do you have any advice for how to help people get a sense if the people are the kind of people they want to work with?

Tom Conrad (00:13:03):
I think people are really, really good at this. Every single time I've taken a job where it turned out that I was working with people who had a different set of values or working styles than I had, I knew. You tell yourself that, at least in my case, I tell myself a story about why the thing I suspect might be the case isn't the case. But you do this in your personal life all the time. You meet people out at dinner, so you get seated next to them at some industry event or something, and sometimes you come home and say to your partner, oh my gosh, the person next to me was just the worst. Then sometimes you're like, I think I made a permanent lifelong connection with this total stranger who just happened to sit next to me.

Lenny (00:13:55):
It's a very simple piece of advice that I think people don't fully appreciate is just trust your instinct, trust your gut. Just pay attention to what comes up when you're around people at a certain company. Okay, you brought up this phrase of notable disasters, and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. I just want to spend some time in these two areas. Maybe the way to set it up is, what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work and maybe advice you share with people?

Tom Conrad (00:14:37):
Probably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually, I think in both instances they became dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. Frankly, even in the case of pets.com, even the high profile nature of it.

(00:15:09):
I could have worked at one of a thousand E-commerce websites in 1999. When I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, they were like, I never heard of the thing that you worked on. But everybody certainly heard about pets.com. It's a pretty funny example too, of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. While as a leadership team, we made I'm sure all kinds of mistakes.

(00:15:39):
One of the things that happened was that there were three overfunded pet E-commerce sites. We all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then. We all thought it was a zero-sum game. That as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising, we all did. It became this unwinnable arms race. There is, I think, a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross. Or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise. Then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for three billion dollars. Biggest E-commerce acquisition of all time. Well, I think it's probably unfair to compare Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick and turned it into something really remarkable.

(00:17:07):
To pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way. The critique that is often leveled at pets.com, or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work. That's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It was really, really early.

Lenny (00:17:33):
I saw a stat, I think you shared somewhere, that you took pets.com from nothing to a public company to completely out of business in 19 months.

Tom Conrad (00:17:40):
Yeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. The leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. It was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. It was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was a fruitless attempt to salvage it.

Lenny (00:18:29):
Did not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?

Tom Conrad (00:18:40):
The miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it re-lit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, for 25 years or something. I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot. I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. It also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different.

(00:19:23):
I had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They're ridiculous. It's like maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, "Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?"

(00:19:42):
I'd be like, "No, I don't know anything about baking." "Oh, you like landscape photography. Do you take photos?" "No, I don't take photos." But I was committed to the bit, actually to the point where when Techwrench interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely. That story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was for New TV at the time.

(00:20:15):
The pitch was, we're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and consumer tech and weld it to the best of Hollywood style content production. To build something completely bespoke and purpose made for consumption on the phone. They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody, it just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them?

(00:20:50):
I listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. We kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow. Then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time, and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product.

(00:21:26):
Both of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself. Both of them had left after about six weeks. Meg's like, "We've raised all this money and we told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help. I would consider it a personal favor if you were to come and spend just a couple of days a week helping." She's like, "I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground." My wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist, and loves her life as a freelance contributor. She's like, "You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week. It's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it?" I'm like, "No. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself."

(00:22:27):
She's like, "No." She's like, "Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do." Well, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away. It was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch.

(00:22:58):
To take advantage of all of the modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. I'm embarrassed about some of what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience. I just really fell in love with the industry again, and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.

Lenny (00:23:35):
Is there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid? What to try to pull towards?

Tom Conrad (00:23:43):
I think I misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. That was always my ambition.

(00:24:16):
Find a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it really delightful way. Go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across. The really great word of mouth. But I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also like a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon.

(00:24:54):
Yes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation. I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money. But we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. It was a pretty major accomplishment. We made a bet that we would augment those sort of-

Tom Conrad (00:26:00):
And we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth, that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.

(00:26:26):
One super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired, so there was no back catalog of it. And it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out. It was really expensive, like I said, it was like a third of the investment we were going to making content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content.

(00:26:51):
And we launched two weeks into Covid and we couldn't make any of that content, except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube, that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood. Now, you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that.

(00:27:26):
But I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, it is enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger, and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself, because our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format.

(00:28:06):
And so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take 6 or 8 or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone could stomach.

Lenny (00:28:27):
Wow. I really like this metaphor and this mental model of the math formula of the entire business and thinking of it that way. I knew Covid changed the way people consumed content and that hurt. Quibi I think it was meant to be on the go, not sitting at home where you could watch anything you want. But also the fact that the content couldn't be made as well, as you were hoping to make.

Tom Conrad (00:28:46):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (00:28:49):
As a CPO, one of the biggest challenges is pushing back, trying to convince the founders of their mistakes, of doing what they want and just powering through it and dealing with it sometimes I guess is there anything you think you could have done looking back, or was the math formula set up for failure from the beginning and it's probably just not going to work out almost no matter what you did?

Tom Conrad (00:29:10):
One of the bets was that we weren't going to just use the apparatus of Hollywood to make the content. In part, we are going to use the apparatus of Hollywood to market the content. So Jeffrey had recruited this incredible Rolodex of literally the world's most famous celebrities to make shows for Quibi. We kind of had everyone either made something for launch or was going to make something.

(00:29:42):
And part of what they're going to do is turn up in culture and talk about their shows. We've heard a lot in the last six months about how hard it's to market movies because the stars can't go out and talk about the movies during the strike.

(00:29:54):
There was this theory that you could apply the marketing technique of Hollywood to get 20, 30 million people into the theater on opening weekend for Quibi. And that was always a very, very audacious take, I thought. Uber has all the money in the world to experiment with paid user acquisition, and they're not consistently a top 10 most downloaded app in the app store.

(00:30:26):
But the theory of Quibi, the math of Quibi, did require us to from day one land in the top 10 and stay there forever. The model would have worked if we could do that. And to the Hollywood marketing apparatus, the numbers that it takes to get there felt kind of small. If you can get 20 million people in to see Shrek on opening night new IP, surely you can get them to take their phone out of their pocket and download this thing and start a free trial.

(00:30:54):
Now, those of us who have spent our life in Silicon Valley making software and really, really tried to get people to show up and download new IP in large numbers know just how hard that is.

(00:31:09):
So maybe if I critique my own contribution to the math equation, maybe I should have beat the drum a little harder about just how unlikely it was that we were going to land the kind of distribution in month one that the model sort of required. If I had to go back and do it again, I think I would spend maybe more time investing and illuminating that aspect of the digital universe.

Lenny (00:31:42):
That is such a good takeaway of just showing the leaders, here's the data, here's the assumptions that we're all betting on, and do you believe this can happen? And they probably would've said, "Yes, this will happen. I'm so confident."

Tom Conrad (00:31:55):
What made it hard was, it wasn't structurally impossible. If you had to be bigger than any app that had ever been made, then you could probably make the case it's impossible. But since you only sort of had the land in the top 10, you couldn't quite say it was impossible, you could just say it was highly improbable.

(00:32:18):
And maybe one of my mistakes was, I guess I imagined that we would launch, and when the likely thing happened that we got millions of people to download the app, which we did, and then when we inevitably struggled to retain those users at high percentages, and we retained at what I think of as a good industry starting point, but we weren't setting any records on retention. I just imagined that what would happen next is the thing that happens in all young companies, you would iterate. You would grind on the funnel until a year later, two years later, six months later, whatever it is. You figured the formula out to get people in and get them to stay and get them to retain.

(00:33:12):
And what I didn't appreciate was just how quickly you go back to the foundational math and then the math really says you just can't. You can't spend two years iterating your way on optimizing the funnels like you would in a startup that had a different cost structure. In a world where you have to spend a billion dollars a year of making content, you just can't afford to not be a hit.

Lenny (00:33:40):
I think it's also important to just remind us, it's okay for these things to happen. People take a bet, as you said, we're going to try this thing, here's our bet, here's our experiment. We're betting on this sort of format in this business. We're going to raise money from investors that know they might lose all their money. And it sometimes doesn't work out. It's part of the game.

Tom Conrad (00:33:56):
It's certainly painful to take money from investors even if they know what they're doing and to not get them a return. I feel a real responsibility to investors to do better than we did at Quibi.

(00:34:08):
But yeah, I mean, there is a risk reward thing that goes along with these investments, and part of the reason they get all the riches on the upside is that they're going to bet on some Quibis along the way too.

Lenny (00:34:18):
So as you were talking, you said that it was called NewTV, and that sparked a memory, and I searched my email. And I actually got an email from a recruiter in 2018, we just kicked off a very special executive opportunity, the CPO at NewTV, a new venture in Los Angeles, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, raising a billion dollars, working with top talent. Are you interested in exploring this opportunity?

Tom Conrad (00:34:41):
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny. Your story could have been so much different.

Lenny (00:34:46):
This could have been Thomas podcast. Lenny, tell me about what happened at Quibi.

Tom Conrad (00:34:51):
I would take that free.

Lenny (00:34:54):
I don't know. There's pros and cons. They even sent this whole PDF, a TV in your pocket, NewTV. Amazing. All right. I'm going to read through this and see what they pitched back in the day.

(00:35:05):
Okay, let's move on to things that worked out really well, let's call it notable successes, other products you worked on that worked out great. So I'll list a few of them. And maybe what might be helpful is just we'll just go through each one and share what you took away from that experience, a lesson you learned from working on those products.

(00:35:23):
The ones that come to mind for me are Snap, Pandora, Apple if we want to go there. Also, you built, I don't know exactly what you did there, but you worked on You Don't Know Jack, this game that I loved. I think if you're an elder millennial, you're just going to like, "Oh my God, I love that game." I don't even remember it exactly, but I just remember the visceral feeling of playing that game and it was so much fun. So that's cool. I didn't know that you worked on that. And then there's also Sonos, which you're on the board.

(00:35:49):
So whatever order you think might be most interesting, just going through those and what did you learn from that experience?

Tom Conrad (00:35:56):
I worked at Apple in the interval where Steve was gone, John Skelly, that kind of period, so System 7, System 8, Power Macintosh, that whole era. And we were doing a lot. We shipped a bunch of great hardware. We transitioned the company from Motorola 68,000 CPUs to the Power PC architecture.

(00:36:19):
But, particularly in that transition, we really struggled to ship consumer software features. I mentioned that I wrote three LAN folders and some other consumer features in my first six months at Apple, and they shipped four years later, actually after I'd left the company. I was a little surprised they were still in the software repository even, candidly.

(00:36:40):
But I'll tell you that one of the things culturally about Apple in that moment was, at least I felt like, a person was really rewarded if they could make a kind of broad contribution across functions. So if you were a talented software engineer, but also a thoughtful product designer, and maybe also had interesting input on product marketing, that you could build a really great reputation inside the company by playing all of those positions a little bit day to day.

(00:37:19):
And so when I left Apple after four years, I look back on my time, I didn't ship as much software as I had hoped, and I felt like a little bit like a professional gadfly. I was six miles wide and a centimeter deep.

(00:37:36):
And I went to work for this company called Berkeley Systems. In addition to You Don't Know Jack, they made a flying toaster screensaver, if you remember. You remember the nineties?

Lenny (00:37:48):
How could you forget that?

Tom Conrad (00:37:50):
And when I met them, they were picking off this game development for this trivia game, and were looking for someone to lead the technical team. And so I joined as technical director for the You Don't Know Jack franchise, managed a team of engineers, and it was a completely different culture than what I was used to at Apple.

(00:38:11):
It was certainly the case that I was welcome to weigh in on the game design or the marketing or some other aspect of the deliverables, but my job was to build the software on time with high quality, period. And if I did those things, I'd be rewarded. And if I didn't, I would not be successful. And no amount of insightful feedback on the gameplay or the packaging, or whatever else I might want to do, was going to benefit me and my career at all.

(00:38:48):
And it was such a blessing to be forced to go deep on something, because I spent a lot of time developing chops as an engineering manager, but I also wrote a ton of software. And that's really honestly when I became a software engineer. My college education was insufficient to get me there, and the amount of software I wrote at Apple was insufficient to get me there. But I came out of my Berkeley Systems You Don't Know Jack experience feeling like I could really hold my own technically in a way that just wouldn't have happened.

(00:39:20):
And so I do think that there's something to be said for a culture where there are swim lanes and people are encouraged to be really, really exceptional in their lane. And so I feel really lucky that I stumbled into You Don't Know Jack When I did.

(00:39:36):
And it was also, I mean, it was the first thing that I worked on that had just huge cultural awareness for a couple of years. I mean, it's crazy, they're still making sequels. It has been nearly 30 years, and there are versions of You Don't Know Jack that are in all of the stores, in the PlayStation store, in the Xbox store, in the iOS store. You can play new versions of You Don't Know Jack to this day. It's crazy.

Lenny (00:40:07):
Did not know that. I see the website now and it's a little different, but basically the same.

Tom Conrad (00:40:13):
So I'd say my lesson from You Don't Know Jack was definitely, it really does pay to get good at something and not just be a generalist.

(00:40:24):
And then, I mean Pandora, it wasn't quite the next thing that happened. After You Don't Know Jack was Pets.com, and then after Pets.com there was nuclear winter in the industry and I worked in enterprise software for a while.

(00:40:37):
And after nuclear winter I had this idea that I was going to build a destination for music discovery on the web. And I've been doing enterprise software, the consumer intranet was non-existent for those years, early aughts.

(00:40:54):
But around 2004, things started to thaw a little bit and you started to hear the first signs of the companies that we came to call Web 2.0, Flickr would've been one of the early examples. And one of the enterprise software things I did was a personalization recommendation engine that used a vector space. It's like a lot of the things that we're talking about now in AI, albeit 20 years ago.

(00:41:21):
And so I knew something about recommendation systems in the enterprise space, and I was super passionate about music. I'm not a musician, but I was that kid in college who would corner you and be like, oh, if you like this band, I got to play this for you and [inaudible 00:41:37] with stereo until you would beg to leave.

(00:41:40):
And so I had this idea that maybe I can use the internet to do that at scale, not with just one person, but with hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people maybe. Introduce them to music that they would love but otherwise would miss out on.

(00:41:53):
And I promised that I was going to tell stories about luck in my career, there's been a gazillion of them. But one really dramatic incidence of that is I was sort of biding my time to exit this enterprise software company. I was VP of engineering, a whole team that reported to me. I felt a lot of responsibility to exit in a responsible way. But I was really excited about this digital music company that I was going to start. But I wasn't telling anyone at all because I didn't want ti to get back to the team.

(00:42:25):
So I flew down to Los Angeles to go out to Coachella in the spring of 2004, and completely randomly physically bumped into a guy that I had gone to high school with on the polo field, and hadn't seen him in a decade. And the thing that we had in common in high school was we loved music. And so I tell them the story of, I'm going to start this company to do personalized digital music on the internet. And he said, there's this woman I work with who just left our company to move to Oakland to work for this little company called Savage Beast that are also doing something in music recommendation. Do you want to talk to them? And I said, "Sure, why not?"

(00:43:11):
So I got introduced to Tim Westergren, who was the founder of Savage Beast. Savage Beast was like a seven or eight full-time employees at that point. They made a music recommendation engine that they licensed to other companies to put in consumer products. So Savage Beast's customers were Best Buy, who put it in kiosks, and AOL, who used it on the AOL Music website. And they were looking for a VP of engineering. And I got the offer, thought about it a little bit. I declined because it was kind of this B2B2C thing and I really wanted to do something consumer and I had an idea about the app.

(00:43:49):
And a month later, they called again and said, "We keep talking to people. We really think that you're the person." And interestingly, one of the reasons they thought that I was the person is they were really impressed by the fact that I had run engineering at Pets.com. So I mean, it's just one of those things where these things do pay dividends, even when they're a disaster.

(00:44:07):
And honestly, what I would really say was almost like a lapse in judgment, I said yes, even though it wasn't the product that I wanted to build. And I won't bore you with all of the details, but 90 days later, after some typical early stage founder drama stuff, the founding head of technology and product had resigned completely unrelated to my arrival. And the company had a new CEO, Joe Kennedy, and Joe had this idea for what he called the 1-Click Personal Radio. And Joe is a product marketer and just the best CEO in the whole world. We spent 10 years together building Pandora.

(00:44:51):
And he sort of gave me the keys and just said, "As long as it fits the brief for 1-Click Personal Radio, it's all yours." And I got to build the team and the culture, in collaboration with him and Tim the founder, over the course of the next 10 years, and just every good thing.

(00:45:14):
So I mean, there's just a million billion lessons from Pandora, and everything I am as a product leader and then an engineering leader comes from things that happen at Pandora.

(00:45:24):
But maybe the thing that I think of first is, I think we met our early audience in an incredibly genuine way. For example, when we launched the support@pandora.com was an alias for all@pandora.com. So if you sent a customer service request to Pandora, every single person in the company received it. And because we made a decision to have no customer support team in the first year, the expectation was that whoever sees the request first should respond to it.

(00:46:01):
And so you would write to us and you would get the founder or you'd get me or you'd get the engineer who wrote the feature or you'd get the CEO. And there were no macros to respond to commonly asked question. There was no read the FAQ. And there were no rules about what you could and couldn't say. If the person's like, "I think this feature is stupid and broken," we would encourage people to say, "You know what? I think you're right and I'm really struggling to get our stupid head of product to agree with me. I'm going to CC Tom and maybe we can convince him that this was a bad decision."

(00:46:35):
And we did all of that because we thought one of our superpowers as a young company was that we could just engage with our audience as real human beings, not as a shiny brand that was trying to be something that we could just never be. This period is where the iPod and iTunes are at the peak of their powers. And so there was no way we could sort of out-Apple Apple on the brand front.

(00:47:02):
And so we were just ourselves, and I think it really, really was a catalyst for the word of mouth that developed around Pandora. And we never spent any money on paid user acquisition, literally no dollars in the entire time I was there, because people loved the product and they told their friends about it and that's how it grew.

Lenny (00:47:21):
I saw a stat that you grew Pandora from 0 to 80 million users, from 10 employees to 3000 employees, from 0 basically to a multi-billion dollar company.

Tom Conrad (00:47:31):
We did those things. We did.

(00:47:34):
Also, I think my product stewardship in some ways set the scene for Spotify to walk through the digital streaming door and show us the exit. So Pandora is, again, such a privilege to be able to work on something that touched and continues to touch tens of millions of people's lives every month. But it's bittersweet from the standpoint that I think we had an opportunity that in some ways we misplayed.

Lenny (00:48:06):
My mom is still a huge fan of Pandora, uses it every day for whatever choice.

Tom Conrad (00:48:10):
I mean, it's still going. And the numbers are still tens of millions of people in the US listen every month. So it's a thing. But yeah, it's a little sad that it didn't have quite the staying power that some of these other things that have come along since have.

Lenny (00:48:25):
Just on that topic, do you think there's something that you could have done, someone could have done? Do you think there was an opportunity to become Spotify? Or is it the business model and the math formula was set up in such a way that it was near impossible?

Tom Conrad (00:48:37):
One of the things that was tough for Pandora was that when we started it, digital music was a category that no investor wanted to touch. It was lawsuits. There was no money to be made. There were relationships with the labels that were completely impossible to nurture. And there had been no big outcomes. I think the biggest exit in digital music when we got going was I think Yahoo had bought Musicmatch for like $400 million. And so that was seen as kind of the ceiling on the opportunity.

(00:49:08):
And along the way we found investors who believed in our vision and invested ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars in the company over its pre-public years. But there was never investor enthusiasm for the company in the category that was anything like the investor enthusiasm that a company like Spotify enjoyed just six, seven years later, Snap enjoyed for its pre-public tenure.

(00:49:35):
And I think part of what was different for Spotify is that the comps were not... Musicmatch was 400 million, they were Pandora at 8 billion, but even above that they were Netflix at 100 billion. And so investors just had this new sort of optimism about what you could do in subscription and in streaming, and Spotify really played that to their advantage in a way that we couldn't because we had gone public and the public market investors were still trying to figure us out. So we didn't have access to capital. It was very hard for us to take the same kind of risks that Spotify took.

(00:50:17):
But then I think we just completely misjudged one really important thing, which is that we were really inspired by disrupting terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is the predominant form of music consumption in the country. People spend, I can't remember the exact stats, but by minutes consumed, it's something like 10 times more music minutes a month on radio in the aughts and early tens than on owned music. And the advertising supported sort of radio market was a $30 billion category, and recorded music was $8 billion.

(00:50:57):
And so we had this idea that we're going to reinvent radio, and Spotify and Rdio and Apple Music and the 14 others, Rhapsody, which was Spotify before Spotify, they were all going to chase this smaller owned recorded music opportunity, and that we could be left relatively alone over here going after the less sexy but actually bigger market. And I think we just got it wrong. It should have been obvious that inevitably all of your music in any format was going to be delivered as a stream from the cloud. And that the record labels in particular, they were going to set the terms on what the structure was. And the structure that they preferred was the Spotify structure. And we operated under a different licensing...

Tom Conrad (00:52:01):
And we operated under a different licensing regime that they hated, that was a statutory license that we got from the government. And it would've been exceptionally risky for us to come out from under the statutory license and do direct deals with the labels, but it was a requirement to play in the world that they imagined as the future, and we should have imagined as the future, too. And eventually, the company got around to it, but it was too late.

Lenny (00:52:29):
It's interesting that so much of this was rooted in that original vision that you shared of Pandora of the radio, smart radio in your pocket, [inaudible 00:52:37] personal radio that you just stayed on that track, even though there was this other track. But I think it's important to point out, you said it was seven years later. And I feel like there's this interesting trend with the companies you've worked at, pets.com and Pandora, that it's too early, you just come too early at these ideas. And I feel like that tells me Quibi might still happen. There's a Quibi coming seven years from now.

Tom Conrad (00:52:59):
You know what's really funny about that? Just today, there's a headline about a Hollywood-produced show that's launching on Instagram Reels and TikTok that was shot vertical. And the headline is literally something like, "Is TikTok the new TV?" And it's pretty funny that literally, that's what Jeffrey and Meg called it when they were incubating the idea. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that purpose-built video for mobile looks a lot like TikTok. And I don't want to take anything away from all of the innovation in that space that they and the other players are driving that Quibi didn't capture in its initial product definition. But I mean, obviously, we stare at our phones consuming video of all kinds all day every day. So there there's definitely something there.

Lenny (00:53:53):
The PDF that I mentioned that I got from the recruiter, the first page again says, "You have a TV in your pocket." So it's exactly what they're pitching. That's amazing. All right. I think what I've learned, I need to bet all my money on this new Quibi clone because the timing might be right.

(00:55:18):
Let's talk about Snap briefly, and then I want to have a couple more questions.

Tom Conrad (00:55:21):
At Pandora, I was the head of product and was head of engineering. And our CEO was brilliant, but he was a product marketer. I mean, Joe was all things. He was an engineer by education, and a great marketer, and a great finance person, and just such a utility player at a very, very high level across every discipline. But he was also really, really good at letting his team do their jobs. He really let me run product and engineering. And so not only did I have tremendous latitude to make good and bad decisions about product, I also really got a seat at the table to help lead the company. So rewarding, so gratifying. Best professional experience that one could have.

(00:56:05):
So I leave Pandora after a decade. I take a year trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. But after about a year, I got introduced to Evan. And it's kind of a funny story. A mutual friend sent this introduction over. Evan immediately responded and said, "Why don't you come down to Los Angeles and have a coffee with me?" So I fly down. It's not clear if it's a job interview or what it is really. I mean, I was just lightly exploring things that were out there and was a big fan of what he was doing with Snapchat. So I spent 45 minutes with him, and then I spent 45 minutes with the head of engineering, and another 45 minutes with the head of legal, and then they tossed me into a conference room with a dozen product designers, all in their mid to late 20s, many of which had gone to school at Stanford with Evan.

(00:57:01):
I would come to learn all really, really, really impressive super, super talented people, but it was just 10 of us sitting around a conference table. And it wasn't really clear that they knew why they were talking to me, but we had an hour long free ranging conversation. And so I left, and I thought it was a totally fascinating morning, but I wasn't sure what had happened, really. It was like "Well, with these interviews, it all seemed very ad hoc. Is there a job opening?" It was a little odd. And I went to lunch on Abbott Kinney and got a text from Evan's admin saying, "Can you come back to the office? Have you gotten on your plane yet?" I was like, "I was just ordering lunch. I'll just come back right away."

(00:57:49):
So I go back. Now, it's one o'clock in the afternoon. This entire thing started at nine o'clock in the morning. I sit down in the conference room. Evan comes in with a manila envelope and says, " We loved you. We'd like for you to be our VP of product," and handed me a written offer, all the terms, the stock compensation, the whole thing. I'm gobsmacked. I'm flattered, that this is really playing to my ego. I can't believe that this company that feels like maybe the most interesting thing that's happening in consumer tech, that their notoriously brilliant and mercurial founder has taken enough of a shine to me that he wants to give at least some of the keys to the product kingdom over after such a short courtship.

(00:58:34):
So I leave, and when some of that buzz wears off, I start to wonder if there's some red flags here maybe. So I tell Evan, "Listen, I'd like to come back and meet more of the leadership team and spend more time with you, go a little deeper on what this means." And so we extend our courtship by another week or so, and I'm super impressed by the rest of the leadership team and the product thinkers and the designers and things that I was going to get to work with on a daily basis. And so I take the job full knowing that it's going to be wildly different than Pandora, where I had all of this latitude to do whatever I might want to do, and in the context of Snapchat, at best, I was going to be Evan's right hand, a person that principally executed his vision.

(00:59:29):
And that's certainly what it was. I mean, Evan and I ended up having a really great collaboration, but it was certainly most days, I was executing on his vision, both at a high level, and very much in the details. And Evan's truly brilliant, I mean, and he's also actually a really nice guy. I think in some ways, he gets a bad rep for... He has very high standards, but he's a very kind person, in my experiences with him. But it was a super exhausting job and not as soul satisfying as I wanted it to be. And after a couple of years, like I said, I thought maybe I just wanted to make croissants or something.

(01:00:14):
But one really, really big important lesson that I learned at Snap is about risk taking. And when you have the financial support and the foundational relationship with your investors that Evan has, it really allowed him to take these really big swings, acquire a technology that he thought was game changing, build features speculatively that maybe would be pruned in any other product roadmap planning process because the odds of them having an outsized impact were modest. And it just allowed him time after time to make bets that paid off, and we forget about the ones that don't work when there are so many home runs in those years. And we didn't have... Environmentally, we weren't set up for that at Pandora, but I think in some ways, I wasn't temperamentally inclined to those kinds of big swings. And I think I take bigger risks and encourage bigger swings now because of things I learned from Evan and Snap.

Lenny (01:01:18):
That is an awesome story. It resonates a lot with what Brian shared about how he thinks about product now and just telling people what to build versus very bottom up, "Tell us ideas you have." That impact, the way you run, we're going to talk a bit about you as CEO now, but I guess, do you have a place that you try to be of CEO as, "Here's what we're building"?

Tom Conrad (01:01:40):
As a product-oriented CEO, how much you should lean in to the details versus set direction and create an environment where great people can do great work, I suspect there's not one answer that applies to every company stage. When I was at Apple, one of the reasons that we struggled to ship things is that Apple did a great job of assembling incredibly, incredibly smart and talented people. Just everyone around me at that early stage in my career was so, so inspiring. But one of the side effects of that is we would get in a room and we would turn over some problem or opportunity, and we would talk ourselves out of every good solution because it wasn't perfect. I used to joke that Apple was the only place in the world where a vote of a thousand to one was a tie because that one person would be so thoughtful in their critique that the other thousand people would be like, "Hmm, that's right, that's right." And even though there's been this huge consensus of what the right answer was, we would talk ourselves out of making decisions.

Lenny (01:02:50):
That one wasn't Steve Jobs, necessarily? It could be somebody else?

Tom Conrad (01:02:53):
He wasn't there.

Lenny (01:02:55):
Wow.

Tom Conrad (01:02:56):
So I think what broke Apple out of that mode was Steve came back and they didn't vote anymore. Steve was just making the call. And so I have some sympathy for Brian and Evan, who have these big, thousands of people working for them. And as they delegate, they grow frustrated that there's not progress at the pace that they're looking for, and that there's indecision, and the people on the teams report that there's just churn and no progress, and there's fiefdoms and politics and all the rest, and that as the CEO, as a brilliant product-oriented CEO, they are uniquely situated to come in and cut through all of that garbage and get the trains running on time again.

(01:03:49):
Having said all of that, I also think that it can be a mistake to be that kind of leader in a smaller org because part of the opportunity in a small org is to assemble a group of people that are incredibly talented that believe in your mission and where who you can easily influence with a much lighter touch and set them up to build a culture in an organization that can execute. And so I see my job as CEO is to try to surf that edge of I'm really in the details. So I deeply understand the business and the product decisions that we're making and the processes that we're using to run the business, but not overplay my hand with respect to dictating outcomes.

(01:04:40):
The one thing you'll always have as CEO is, no matter how much you tell the team that when I swing by their virtual desk and say, "I've been thinking about this little detail that's not important right now, but what do you think?" It's like nine out of 10 times, that person is going to go and start working on that thing. And so you do have to be just really careful about the way you engage in some of those details, I think.

Lenny (01:05:06):
There's a really good episode I had with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he shared this framework called flash tags that they use at Coda, and I think it comes from HubSpot, of you tell people, "Here's what the subpoena is. Is it an FYI? Is it a suggestion? Is it a do this?" There's four of them and one's like, "I will die on this hill. You need to do this."

Tom Conrad (01:05:27):
I try to do a lot of that. I wish I could say that in my experience that that pays off. I spend an awful lot of time, even the stuff I say very clearly, just one person's opinion, focus group of one, "Don't change your priorities to go work on this," it has more of an outsized impact on people's behavior than I intended.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Yeah. Easier said than done. Coming back to your journey, we've talked through the story up until getting to Quibi, but two years ago, you went in a whole new direction, and you're now the CEO of a company called Zero. What is it like to move from just being a product leader or engi leader at a company to being the CEO for the first time? Why did you choose Zero as that role? And what have you learned as CEO that you wish you knew as a product leader or engi leader at a company that listeners might find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:06:19):
It's been a really, really incredible couple of years. In the aftermath of Quibi, I spent a lot of time, as we all do, soul-searching about what I learned and what I might want to do next. And as I thought about it, I realized that I really wanted to move on to something where I can have a direct impact on the culture and values of the company that I was involved in. I really got that opportunity at Pandora in a big way. And I had spent the five years of Snapchat and Quibi working for Evan and Meg and Jeffrey who are all incredible business leaders, but have their own very specific style and approach, and that leaves a mark on the culture that's unique to the founder.

(01:07:04):
And then as we've discussed, I'm always really interested in building things that are near and dear to me, and I was particularly thinking about what can I do that could have a really positive impact on the world in my next chapter. I've built an awful lot of media stuff through the years, video games and streaming services and so forth, and it seemed like maybe there was something that had a little bit more weight to it that I could spend my time on. And so my first thought was I would start something, a company idea I was quietly workshopping for some months. And completely independent from all of that, it's eight months into the pandemic, and my own personal health was at an all time low. I was 50 or 60 pounds overweight, my cholesterol was in the red zone. I mean, I was out of breath climbing stairs, which is something that I had never encountered in my life before.

(01:07:59):
I'm a bit of a yo-yo dieter and I'm always critical of looking in the mirror, but I was never ever really worried about my health, my longevity, and suddenly, I was. And so my solution to that was to go really deep on metabolic health, just thousands of hours of podcasts and videos and glucose monitoring patches and Oura Rings and digital fitness gear and just to try to understand the things that impact health and longevity. And as much as I would like to report that what I learned is that there's some magic pill that you can take, maybe some off label rapamycin or something, the truth is, is that to live a longer and healthier life, you really have to attack what I would call metabolic disease, which will manifest in overweight and obesity and pre-diabetes and diabetes and high cholesterol and all of these things that impact your long-term health.

(01:08:59):
And so I found Zero in this path and was using it to help with my own health journey. And Mike Maser founded the company four and a half years ago, and he and I were talking in this interval about my own experience with the product. I was just giving him product feedback and so forth, and he was telling me a little bit about his own entrepreneurial journey. And somewhere in the conversation, Mike said, "My intention is to step up into the executive chair role and to find a CEO for the company." So again, in my story, just over and over and over, this incredibly fortuitous thing happened. I just knew immediately that it ticked all the boxes, "Here's a chance to lead something that already had some momentum to impact the culture and values in a really direct way and was really, really close to my own personal journey."

(01:09:50):
And so we know we've got a great little company and 27 people, we've got more than a million users on the platform every month. Over a hundred thousand of them pay us with tens of millions of dollars of revenue through the years, and have had double-digit growth even coming out of the pandemic when lots of health and fitness companies saw retreats. And most importantly, it actually works. 75% of the people who use the platform lose weight. People lose, on average, five to 10% of their body weight in the first 60 days. And because of the success that people have, we grow just completely organically. We have no paid user acquisition at all. It's really a word of mouth business.

(01:10:31):
But that's not to say that it's not challenging. All startups are challenging. And what we've really focused on for the last couple of years is we've been really focused on unit economics, really trying to understand how much value can we derive and deliver for every person who downloads and installs the app, how do we convert them through all of the funnels efficiently and get them engaged with the product and get them to retain and drive that up in a really systematic way. And with my whole career, I'm definitely a person who started off thinking software development was mostly an art form, you find brilliant visionaries who have a deep understanding of human behavior, and they craft solutions for problems that other people don't see, and they make them delightful, and they get all the little details right. And when you found product market fit for the art, then you optimize them through a really quantitative take.

(01:11:34):
And so I'm definitely a person that sees both sides of that left brain and right brain equation that's important in software. But here's the thing my eyes have really opened to in the last two years. While companies are definitely the software that they make and the products that they deliver and that there is an art and science to that, as I described, there is also, if you step back, there is an equation that describes the business. It talks about how you turn investment into returns. And I suppose if I had come up with finance and been a business major that maybe that's the way that I would've conceived of companies to begin with. So maybe it's a little embarrassing that I had to be 53 years old before, I think, the scales fell through my eyes and I was like, "Oh, companies are equations."

(01:12:24):
And so when we first started talking about lifetime value and customer acquisition costs and getting those two things balanced and just the thinking about the unit economics of the business, my natural instinct was to go immediately to the leaf nodes of the equation like, "Oh, what percentage of people do we convert from install to registered and from registered to trial," and these very way down at the bottom of all the funnels and to ask the product team like, "Let's try to optimize these." And in the process though of trying to understand where we could take the business as we optimize those various dimensions and trying to understand too which of the dimensions had the most leverage, I started building these ever more sophisticated models that describe the whole business.

(01:13:16):
I mean, in startups, you get to wear a lot of hats. And definitely a hat that I'm wearing that I didn't anticipate at all is I'm the full-time FP&A guy for Zero. And so I built this spreadsheet that aggregates data from all of our business intelligence tools and raw data from our subscription transactions and looks at all of our historical results and all of our expenses and spend and then could use that to predict future scenarios by manipulating all of these variables. And it's just not at all the way I ever thought about products before. And I know that you've got lots of listeners like, "This guy's an idiot. This is a fundamental way to contemplate product work."

(01:14:05):
But if there's anybody out there like me who thought of it as art first and then optimization in the details, it is really, really powerful to spend the time to create the model that describes the whole thing so you can identify what are the high leverage points to focus on. So been doing a lot of that at the company in the last two years and it's really starting to deliver incredible results. Like everything in life, I mean, you sign up for things so you can learn, and that's the big one for me in the last year.

Lenny (01:14:36):
I really love that takeaway of as a CEO coming back to share, here's what you should be thinking about that the CEO is probably thinking about, as a product leader, you may not be, of trying to actually spend the time to think about the business model and understand it deeply because your founders are thinking about it all the time. And so if you're not, you're missing out on here's a way to influence them, here's a way to...

Tom Conrad (01:14:57):
It's so funny too because it's a thing I suddenly understand something that mystified me through my entire career, which was I'd go to board meetings and the investors would ask these probing questions, but they were really never about the product and what the product did and what the product roadmap was and what the features were and what this... It all seemed to operate at this level that was almost completely independent of the details of the "what is the solution you put into the world", which as a product-oriented thinker, was just completely baffling to me. And I now realize that they were tilling the soil that I'm talking about, they were tilling.

(01:15:39):
It doesn't really matter what the screens are and what the features are. I mean, it certainly matters, but that there's another higher order way to look at a company, which is really about the optimization of this equation. And I think particularly, if you sit on 25 boards, it's probably a much more efficient way to evaluate how your companies are doing and where to spend your time and how to help by thinking about them abstracted up at that layer. So I will never stop thinking about software development as being an art form and I will never stop enjoying the days when I get to lean in on the details, but it's been pretty eyeopening.

Lenny (01:16:18):
The other thing that stands out here, one is I think this is especially true for consumer subscription apps, which I've done some research on. And basically, they never work. There's Duolingo, there's Zero, which I didn't know how much scale you guys reached. My math here real quick. So you have a million users, a hundred thousand paying users. You charge at 10 bucks a month. I know there's a discount for an annual plan, but basically, you're making somewhere around a million dollars a month, which you don't have to confirm or deny it, but that's the math I just did, and that's crazy. So congrats. That's a rare successful consumer subscription app. It never happens.

Tom Conrad (01:16:53):
And like I said, every startup is hard, and I never stop being surprised at the new hard things that pop up every day. But we're on a really great run. We've had a tremendous year, and I'm just so, so proud of the team we've assembled. They're incredible for the last.

Lenny (01:17:08):
Part of the reason you're so successful is exactly what you said. There's a huge focus on LTV/CAC, the math formula, because for these sorts of businesses, the crux of it is can you acquire people for less money than you need to spend?

Tom Conrad (01:17:21):
One thing that's really fortunate for Zero is Mike Maser, who founded the company, and I have both been around the block long enough and enough times that we remember 2008, we remember 2000. And so in these moments in the pandemic, there were companies in our category that were raising hundreds of billions of dollars with the intention of throwing it at paid user acquisition. And we made a conscious decision to optimize the value of the organic traffic that we were getting and to drive our growth through LTV expansion rather than top of funnel expansion, which was candidly not in fashion in 2021, 2022.

Tom Conrad (01:18:00):
... in 2021, 2022. It turns out it's much more in fashion these days as companies are called upon to be much more capital efficient than they were during the pandemic era. I guess I feel somewhat fortunate that my natural inclination as an entrepreneur is more in sync with the expectations of the market than it was for a while.

Lenny (01:18:27):
Okay. So you've probably had the longest career arc of anyone I've had on this podcast. You've worked at all of these different companies in a lot of different phases. You're still at it. And I'm curious what you've learned about how to maintain your mental health and avoid burnout essentially through this journey. You mentioned you take some time off. Is there anything else you found or is that a trick of just how to not burnout?

Tom Conrad (01:18:51):
Do you know this Japanese concept called Ikigai?

Lenny (01:18:55):
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but share it. Share it for folks that may not be familiar.

Tom Conrad (01:18:59):
So the idea is it's a Venn diagram and there are four spheres. There's a sphere that's labeled what you love. There's a sphere labeled what you're good at. There's a sphere labeled what the world needs, and there's a sphere called what you can be paid for, and where they all intersect is this Japanese idea, Ikigai. It's the intersection of what you're good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. If you find that, it's Ikigai. And interestingly, your listeners should go and find this because there are interesting ways to label the other intersections, the intersections where all four don't come together. And what's really interesting is that the ones that are three but not four, I think because they're the ones that are close but not quite to this really satisfying thing. And so it's like when you find those, it's really easy to choose a job or to choose a path where you have three but not four, which is a really great recipe if you're feeling like there's something just out of your reach that's really important.

(01:20:09):
Anyway, it's a great framework to think about your life and your career. So to start, I'm incredibly lucky that it's all Ikigai for me. What I'm good at, what I love, what the world needs, what I get paid for, they have always overlapped. And a big part of it is just what I love is this world. I love software, I love building software, I love writing software, I love using software. People are like, "What are your hobbies?" I don't think I have any hobbies and I think about, "Well, what kinds of things do I do on the weekend for fun?" And it's like I'm teaching myself After Effects or something, which I will immediately forget, but it's just fun to go really deep on some piece of interesting software.

(01:21:02):
So I'm very lucky. And so I think that has been super sustaining for me. One of the reasons I've been able to do it as long as I have without really burning out is that just, it's what I do. And in some ways it's why I come back to it. It's easy to say, "I'm going to become a pastry chef," but left to my own devices, I use software, I make software. It's my hobby, it's my passion, it's all the things.

(01:21:29):
But a couple of thoughts about how one engages with their work. One thing is I'm really not a #hustling kind of leader. There was a woman that I worked with on the Finder just out of college that left a really big mark on me. My own style of work then, I think I mentioned my memory of flashing, blinking the folder animation was a 2: 00 AM kind of thing. I was 23 years old. I woke up at 11 o'clock in the morning. I went to the office, I screwed around and played video games in the Apple Arcade and went to a couple of meetings and had lunch and stood at the whiteboard and pontificated about some nonsense. And then about four o'clock every day I would start writing software and I would write software until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and then I would go out to dinner with people from the team in the middle of it and whatever.

(01:22:29):
And so it kind of looked like I spent 14 hours a day, six or seven days a week at Apple, and I was celebrated for this. There was lots of nights where I would work clear through the night and my boss would come in the next morning, he'd be like, "Are you still here?" And I'm like, "I'm still here. Look at this cool thing I did." And I got a lot of attention for that. And then there's this woman on the team who showed up every single morning at 8:30, sat at her desk, wrote a ton of great software, and every night packed her stuff up and left. And she contributed more than I ever did. And I don't think she got the same kind of recognition that I got because of the way she did the work.

(01:23:11):
And when we were building the team and culture at Pandora, I thought about her a lot and really made a point of saying that I just wasn't interested in performative contribution, that it's the work that matters and what I want to celebrate is if you can show up and do it and go home and have other things in your life, because I think that's a recipe for being able to do it on a sustained basis rather than burning yourself out.

(01:23:38):
I think there's some nuance in this. I think 22 year old me was always going to want to work through the night. And so I think creating space that that's okay too is important. And I think maybe in some ways at Pandora it was almost like that wasn't okay. It was like, "You should be taking more breaks. Why are you going this hard?" But I do try to create environments where people have a reasonable balance between their regular life and their technology life or room for that if they choose it. And I do think that that has through the years, has helped me keep at it, but I still work a lot of nights and weekends because I love it. It's what I do.

(01:24:16):
Here's the other thing. I got very, very lucky with the Pandora experience and got this outsized, probably inappropriate financial reward for being a part of it and gave me options that I never imagined that I would have. And so after 10 years I left and I didn't know what I would do, but I did really need a break. It was a really hard job and that was definitely a moment where I needed some time to recover. But I think if you had asked me on that first day, I would say, "I don't know why these people find success and then start another company right away. Why? There's so many things you could do in the world, why would you start another company? It's so hard."

(01:25:02):
And I was particularly in love with the idea that I had access to experience. I didn't really care about things, I didn't want a fancy watch or whatever, a car, but I wanted to see the world. And so I thought, "I'm going to just go and I'm going to live in London for three months, then I come back to San Francisco for a month. I'm going to go live in Mexico City for three months and I'm going to just have this life where I'm soaking up experiences." And after doing that for six months, the thing that I came to realize is that what I care about way more than experiences is relationships. If you're the person who is constantly on a plane seeking out some new experience, it's really hard to form and maintain intimate, satisfying relationships.

(01:25:47):
So I went back to San Francisco, I'm like, "I can't be all over the world if I want to be engaged with friends and like-minded people." And you know what people do on Monday morning? They go to work. And so if you want to be engaged with humanity, where they are on Monday morning is at work. And so more than I had the itch to build things, which I do very much have, I had the itch to collaborate, to be in the game with other people. So that was what took me to Snapchat, took me out of chasing experiences and took me back to building again. And then as we've already described, at a point I thought, "Well, I care about this collaboration, but maybe it doesn't need to be software that I'm creating in the world." And Quibi gave me a chance to fall back in love with that process again. And here we are, more software.

Lenny (01:26:48):
Plus being on a board of a hardware company. What you just shared reminds me of Mark Manson's book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. Have you read this book?

Tom Conrad (01:26:58):
I have not.

Lenny (01:26:59):
Okay. It sold a bazillion copies, and the core of it is that we get joy out of solving problems and we think we'll be happy when we have freedom to do nothing. But it turns out freedom is only helpful to help us discover the problems we just want to keep solving.

Tom Conrad (01:27:16):
Yeah, totally. I think that's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:27:20):
It sounds like that's the experience you went on. Last question, this new segment, I'm going to call Contrarian Corner. And the question is, is there something that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't?

Tom Conrad (01:27:35):
There's a segment in our industry that believes this very intensely, which is there's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. And I think in some ways our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. I use an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere, that would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has, as I described, the mathematical formula that's going to win, that has the market opportunity that's the right size, that has the 10X thinking that can really... And I'm a little biased here because while I am a CEO for the first time now, I've never been a founder and I've been lucky enough to find a bunch of young teams that could benefit from my skills and enthusiasms, and sometimes to some success and sometimes to some embarrassment, but always really, really interesting.

(01:28:53):
Yeah. If you're out there and you think that the only possible way you can be successful in this industry on any metric, whatever metric you care about: you want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want any of the things that people aspire to, outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Lenny (01:29:24):
I 100% agree with that. I'm always telling people, "Don't start a company. It's super painful, very rarely works out. It's so hard." I don't know what's harder, being a product manager or being a founder, probably being a founder. They're both very hard.

Tom Conrad (01:29:37):
Yeah, it is quite hard too. Yeah. Yeah. And just to be perfectly clear, there's something really special about founders. At both Pandora and now at Zero, the actual founders have from time to time said, "Well, you're like a founder." And I'm like, "I'm nothing like a founder. You took all the risk. When I showed up, there was a team and there was momentum and there was money in the bank. I appreciate your desire to say complimentary things, but 'You're like a founder' is not one that I'll take."

Lenny (01:30:08):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tom Conrad (01:30:11):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:30:13):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Tom Conrad (01:30:17):
I really love Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook. It's organized into chapters about foundational company building, building a leadership team, building a board, and in addition to the thoughtful synthesis on that topic from Elad, he has an interview of someone that he does relevant to that section on each of the chapters. Really, really great read and super actionable if you're a leader in a young company. In a completely different end of the spectrum, I love big, complicated science fiction and there's a lot of garbage science fiction out there to be sure, but when you find something special, it's the best. So probably through the years in that category, there's a book called Hyperion by Dan Simmons. That's just a total classic. Everybody should read it.

Lenny (01:31:08):
I read that. I think I read the first couple in the first one.

Tom Conrad (01:31:11):
Yeah. There is a sequel that's exceptional as well. And it's probably worth warning your readers that Hyperion is quite long and has an absolute cliffhanger.

Lenny (01:31:21):
I think they're making a show out of it, which is going to be wild. I don't know how they do a show around that book. I thought you were going to say this other book, A Fire Upon the Deep. Have you heard of this book?

Tom Conrad (01:31:29):
Oh, that's so good too.

Lenny (01:31:31):
Okay. That's also very complicated, but incredible.

Tom Conrad (01:31:34):
Yeah, I had completely forgotten about that. That's a very special book. There's a couple in that series too.

Lenny (01:31:40):
Yeah, I think I only read the first one. Also, Three-Body Problem is the other one that I always think about. It's come up a couple of times on this podcast. Let's move on to the next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or a TV show?

Tom Conrad (01:31:53):
I consume a lot of video content, both stuff that I'm very proud to talk about and stuff that I'm less proud to talk about, but I really liked the new Damon Lindelof show that's on Peacock called Mrs. Davis. So Lindelof, of course, from Lost and the new Watchmen on HBO, and Mrs. Davis is about an AI that you wear in your ear, like the HER AI and a nun that is hell-bent on the AI's destruction, and it reads like an early Coen brothers movie. It's super darkly funny and really, really thoughtful and unlike too much streaming, I think it's seven episodes, and it is a perfectly encapsulated story that has a beginning, middle, and an end and doesn't need to ever have another episode. It's amazing. Get yourself a Peacock subscription for at least a month to watch Mrs. Davis.

Lenny (01:32:56):
Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Tom Conrad (01:32:59):
There are two things about interviews. The first is I always encourage people when they're thinking about their interview questions to take any question that they're tempted to pull from their own current experience with the goal of trying to, how would this person solve this thing that I'm working through right now? Because just causing the other person to speculate and oftentimes about your own business, I think you know really well that they don't actually know anything about, it creates this imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee that feels out of sync with how I think about the collaborative nature of a great interview. So I tell people that almost every interview question should start with, "Tell me about a time in your career when..." to give them permission or to set their expectation that I'm asking them to tell me about something they've actually done that is relevant to the topic that I'm probing.

(01:33:59):
So that's just a structural thing that I try to do. And then usually towards the end of the interview, I ask almost everybody, "Imagine that you had a really great day at work. What was it that you did on that day?" Because what I'm trying to figure out is left to their own devices, what do they go to naturally because it rewards them? Because I think it's really important to find the highest best use of everyone you hire. And sometimes you can get a little bit to the bottom of what's the highest best use if you understand the things where there's a natural reward mechanism because it's like, "Well, I had this great day. I'm going to do more of that tomorrow." "What was the thing?" And it's just pretty illuminating.

Lenny (01:34:45):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Tom Conrad (01:34:49):
I have bought every pair of headphones on the planet, in part because Apple's headphones do not stay in my ears. I've sneezed one across the room, I've lost one down a drainpipe. They don't stay, none of them, the wired ones, the not wired ones, the in-ear ones, and it's left me feeling honestly like I am some kind of anatomical freak. I look at other people wearing them, I'm like, "What is going on with their ear that it's just staying there perfect?" It seems inconceivable to me. Nonetheless, I have a pair of AirPods Pro's that I want to love and put up with the fact that I'm going to drop them, lose them, sneeze them across the room.

(01:35:32):
But recently I came across this product from a company called Eartune that they're replacement tips and they just have the littlest bit of compression foam on them. They don't make the AirPods so big that they won't fit in the recharging case or anything, and they work. Miraculously, they stay in my ear. And Apple has this feature called Size Fit or something, go in settings, find your AirPods, scroll all the way down in the settings, and you can run this test where they play some audio and they tell you how good the seal is. And that revealed that my right ear is weirder than my left ear. So I actually have to use different tips in either sizes. Suddenly this sounds like a vaguely disgusting conversation that we're having. Anyway, I'm just really thrilled about my ability to wear Apple's AirPods after all these years.

Lenny (01:36:32):
I think what we're learning is you are a mutant, your ears are different. Cool. We'll link to that product in the show notes.

Tom Conrad (01:36:40):
Okay.

Lenny (01:36:41):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either in work or in life that you find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:36:48):
You can't be a product person without having an eye rolly Charles Eames quote that's at the center of your existence. And for me, the Charles Eames quote is, "The details are not the details. They make the design." And I just really absolutely believe that, that the devil is in the details when you're a product designer and be uninterested in nuance at your peril.

Lenny (01:37:14):
Final question. You worked with the creator of the GIF format. How does he pronounce, giff or jiff?

Tom Conrad (01:37:22):
Yeah. So before all of this, I worked at a company called CompuServe when I was in high school.

Lenny (01:37:29):
CompuServe, I used CompuServe. I didn't know that. That's amazing.

Tom Conrad (01:37:33):
There was a guy on the team named Steve Wilhite who invented Graphics Interchange Format, GIF, and he was a straight out of central casting, 1960s neck beard programmer type, and the first I had ever encountered and very prickly. And it's crazy, but at the time, Steve would take all comers in the fight that it was pronounced jiff. Now he's obviously wrong. It's obviously pronounced giff. It's crazy to me now 35 years later, this is still a topic that pops up on the internet every once in a while. It's somehow like Zelig, I cross paths with the guy who created Graphics Interchange Format and I know his opinion on the topic even though it's an unpopular one.

Lenny (01:38:35):
Got it. So he likes jiff, but you agree it's giff?

Tom Conrad (01:38:38):
It's definitely giff. It's obviously giff.

Lenny (01:38:40):
Okay, great. We're on the same page. We've decided. Let it be known.

Tom Conrad (01:38:44):
Let it be known.

Lenny (01:38:45):
Tom, we've talked about successes, we've talked about failures, mental health, general health, all kinds of awesome stories. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some other questions that I didn't ask, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tom Conrad (01:39:00):
I'm @tconrad on all the socials, from Twitter to Threads to Instagram. My DMs are open everywhere, and I would absolutely be delighted to hear from any of your listeners on any topic that they choose. And what can you do for me? I would love for folks to download Zero and give it a try and send me some feedback about what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong, and we'd love to have our little product be part of your life.

Lenny (01:39:32):
Awesome. Tom, thank you so much for being here.

Tom Conrad (01:39:35):

# A founder’s guide to crisis management | Uri Levine (Waze co-founder, serial entrepreneur)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've co-founded 10 different companies. You've been on the board of 20. You've also built two unicorns including Waze. The biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to-

Uri Levine (00:00:09):
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Anything you wanted to share around hiring and firing?

Uri Levine (00:00:23):
Every time that you hire someone new, mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, knowing what I know today, would I hire this person? If the answer is no, fire them immediately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Let's actually talk about fundraising.

Uri Levine (00:00:37):
Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation is the first slide. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point. Now the second most important slide is the last one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze and nine other companies. He sold two companies for over a billion dollars. He's also been on 20 different startup boards, including a dozen he's still currently on. He's also advised over 50 founders and startups over his career. More recently, he wrote a book that summarizes all of his advice for founders called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, A Handbook for Entrepreneurs. In the foreword to the book, Steve Wozniak said, "This book will change your life and become your Bible if you are an entrepreneur," and I cannot disagree with that. This book is very tactical with amazing stories and walks you through the ideation phase all the way to exiting your company.

(00:01:39):
In my conversation with Uri, we chat about many of my favorite chapters, including why falling in love with the problem is so important, how to find product market fit, a really clever tactic for firing people who aren't a fit for your company, a ton of really genius tactical advice for improving your fundraising pitch and so much more. With that, I bring you Uri Levine, and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Uri, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Uri Levine (00:02:17):
Thank you. Happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:18):
Okay, so here's what I've gathered about your career, and let me know if I've missed anything. You've co-founded 10 different companies, including four you're still operating. You've been on the board of 20 companies. You've advised 50, maybe more, companies. You've also built two unicorns, including Waze, which you sold for over a billion dollars, which back then was an astronomical amount of money. It still is. So does that all sound right? Is there anything big I missed about your career?

Uri Levine (00:02:48):
That sounds about right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
I think what's really interesting to me is that from all of that experience, the biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to fall in love with the problem. It's what your book is called. You have a T-shirt that you're wearing right now that you wear on every podcast that says that exactly. Clearly this lesson has struck a big chord with you. I'm curious if there's a moment where you realize that that's the core and that's something that every founder needs to get right. Is there an aha moment or is it kind of this progressive like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is the secret."

Uri Levine (00:03:19):
I'm not sure that this is a certain moment. I think that that was evolving over time and realizing that, look, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurship journey is about value creation. The simplest way to create value is solve a problem. That's the simplest way. And in my background, I'm an engineer always looking for the simplest way, and solve a problem is the simplest way, and so this is where fall in love with the problem coming from, and people occasionally would confuse the T-shirt with the book, and now the T-shirt is about 10 or even more years old and the book is only two years old, and so I was wearing those T-shirts for a long while before I wrote the book and when I wrote the book that was obvious that this is going to be the name of the book, but they are way more into that, right?

(00:04:06):
So when you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful. But also the story that you are about to tell is way more compelling. Just imagine that we will be here in 2007, just before I started Waze, and I will tell you I'm going to build an AI crowd-source based navigation system and you're going to say, "Oh, yeah, very interesting," but you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care, and when your customer cares, they want you to be successful, and when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.

(00:04:56):
And so in that sense, fall in love with the problem is really a key to increase the likelihood of being successful. So in general, all of my startups start with a problem. Think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a better place if you solve that and then ask yourself, so who has this problem? If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution. If you follow this path and your solution works, it's guaranteed that you're creating value.

(00:05:47):
If you start with a solution, you might be building something that no one cares and that's really frustrating. So fall in love with the problem. This is where you want to start. Now this is really hard because I am getting tons of emails every week from entrepreneurs and they all start with what we are doing and I don't really care what you're doing. What I really care about is why you are doing that, and this is the problem that you solve or the value that you create or the value that you create for me. This is what really matters, right? And so if you start your story with, "Our company is," or, "Our system is," and in the recent year everything is, "Our AI system is," or, "Our AI company is." But generally speaking, if you start your story with that, you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with, "The problem we are solving is," Then you focus on the problem. If your story start with, "The value that we create for you is," then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution.

(00:09:02):
I want to follow a couple threads here because I imagine there's certain problems people fall in love with. "Amazing. I want to solve this very obscure problem for my family or a friend of mine," and then they realize this is never going to be a huge venture scale business, if that's a goal of theirs. You talked about like, make sure enough people have this problem versus just getting a therapist that's going to help you with this problem. What are some signals and heuristics folks can use to help them understand this is a big enough problem that it's really worth their time?

Uri Levine (00:09:30):
So people ask me, "So you send me to speak with users. How many?" And I will tell them a hundred. You don't need a hundred, but the hundred basically say you need to get out of your comfort zone. It's not just your close friends and family that you need to discuss that. You need to discuss that with people that you don't know. And usually what happen is, and the validation is in most cases is really clear, right? If you tell someone, "This is the problem I'm going to address," and they will tell you, "Oh, I know someone that has this problem," it's not a real problem. If they will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no. This is not the problem. The problem is," and they will give you their description of the problem. This is something that you really want to follow. So if you speak with a hundred people, but if you actually speak with 20 people that you don't know, you will get validated whether or not this problem is real or not.

(00:10:23):
And look, it's not the only way to become successful, right? You look at one of the most successful products in the world, the iPhone, right? And you ask yourself, what was exactly the problem when they started? And the answer is that there was no problem when they started. There were smartphones and people were actually very happy with them. And so occasionally we need to invent something completely new, but solving a problem is simply the simplest way to create value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):
Another element of picking a problem to work on, so you say you fall in love with a problem. Is being excited to work on this problem. There's oftentimes problems you find that aren't that exciting to you or you're not excited to work on real estate software, but you find there's a big problem. How important is it that you're personally passionate and excited to work on this thing versus like, "Oh, wow. This is a huge business opportunity. I got to go after it. It doesn't matter if I'm not that passionate about it."

Uri Levine (00:11:20):
Fall in love, right? This is really passionate. Really, really passionate. Look, the journey is really hard and complex and long and so you have to be in love in order to go into this journey because otherwise it's not going to be successful. You really want to be passionate. If you're not passionate about the problem, even though that the problem might be real and big and significant, there is not enough drive, there is not enough internal drive to take you through the hardship of the journey, and so you need to be passionate. You need to fall in love. You personally need to fall in love with the problem. And then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:05):
Is there an example of a pivot that you maybe went through where you realized the problem was not as big as you thought or you realized there's a bigger problem?

Uri Levine (00:12:13):
So actually there are many, right? So Oversee deals with maybe biggest secret in travel industry. What happened to airfare after you booked your flight? Now you have no idea because you never compare prices after you met the reservation. But you know that airfare is going up and down all the time. It's going up and down before you are making the reservation and keep on going up and down after you're making the reservation. So if this is the price that you paid and this is cancellation fees, if the price drops here, you can rebook the same flight at the cheaper price.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:48):
Genius.

Uri Levine (00:12:49):
If you would only keep on comparing prices after that, right? So we started this company that is actually monitoring your own itinerary and we realized that this is going to be huge benefits to travelers and we started that as a B2C company, direct to consumers, and we realized that even though the people really care, they are not willing to take the action that is required, and we ended up with doing that for corporates, and in corporates there are very simple ways for them to engage that automatically, so automatic rebooking and so forth, and we can save corporates about 10% of the travel budget that goes directly to bottom line. So we started that as a B2C and then we realized that this is way harder than we think it is, and we ended up with converting that into B2B, which turns out to be very successful for us. And so occasionally there are companies that you start your journey with one perception and you change that and that will happen multiple times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
That's an awesome example. I want to, before I move on to, I'm kind of thinking about this in the phases of starting a company. So we're talking right now about coming up with the idea that you want to commit to. A lot of people that want to start companies are not sure how to find a great idea, so the core advice you're sharing is find something, find a problem, and fall in love with solving that problem in whatever way you can. Do you have any other advice for helping somebody find a problem and finding a startup idea? Where do you find startup ideas? What do you find? What does work for you mostly?

Uri Levine (00:14:30):
So for me, it's usually personal frustration that leads me to start to think about it, whether or not we can change it. I hate traffic jams, right? I hate leaving money on the table, right? So there are many things that I ran into and I get frustrated and I tell myself, "No, no, no. There must be a different way to do that." But in general, look, the problem itself needs to start from you, right? Something that really bothers you, something that you care about, and then it's the validations of the problem that you speak with many people, try to realize. Now if you'll tell me, oh, this is a B2B, then speak with many businesses, right? Speak with those that you believe actually do have this problem and I understand their perception.

(00:15:13):
Once you validate that, then there are few things that you need to realize. One is about the journey itself. This is going to be a multi-dimensional journey. It's going to be at least three dimensions and maybe fourth, right? So the three dimensions, one of them is it's going to be a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs. And look, if you'll tell me that all the businesses in the world have ups and downs, I agree, but the frequency of those when you are building a startup? Way higher. I think that I heard the best quote on that from Ben Horowitz, Ben Horowitz from Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, and before that he used to be a CEO of a startup and he was asked whether or not he was sleeping well at night and he said, "Oh, yeah, I slept like a baby. I woke up every two hours and cried." And that's really the reality of that. The frequency of the differences are so dramatic that there is nothing compared to that, a roller coaster journey.

(00:16:17):
It's also a journey of failures. Look, we are trying to build something new that no one did before, and even though that we think that we know exactly what we are doing, we don't. So we try. We try one thing and it doesn't work. We try another thing and it doesn't work. Or if we keep on trying different things until we find one thing that does work. Now, if you realize that this is going to be a journey of failures, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that if you're afraid to fail, then in reality you already failed because you are not going to try. Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed, that because you haven't tried new things before. If you're going to try new things, you will fail. Michael Jordan used to say that, "I've failed over and over and over and over again and this is what made me successful." And so this is the first conclusion.

(00:17:07):
The second conclusion is that you really want to fail fast. Just think about it, right? If you fail fast, you still have plenty of time to try another attempt and build another version of the product. Try another go-to-market approach. Try a different business model so you still have plenty of time to make more and more and more attempts, and the more attempts that you have, you simply increase the likelihood of being successful. Just think that you play basketball, right, and you try to score from half court. If you have one shot and you are not Steph Curry, you are very likely to miss. But if you actually have a lot of shots, one of them you're going to make. That's it. Just think about it. The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect. You don't need to be perfect. You need to be good enough in order to win the market, and the way that you are going to become good enough, by the way, is really simple. You start with not good enough and you iterate and iterate and iterate until you become good enough and then you'll win.

(00:18:10):
The third dimension is that this is going to be long journey. Very long. Way longer than you think it is. And the longest part of it is until you figure out product market fit, and product market fit goes into the different phases of building a company. To a certain extent, I would say, look, the difference between a corporate and a startup is that a corporate knows this is our value proposition, this is the product that we are selling, this is the pricing of this product that we are selling, this is the target audience, this is how we are going to sell them, this is how we going to the market, and all we have to do is keep on executing and hopefully nothing will change over the period of time. When you start as a startup, you don't have a product. You don't know what's the business model. You don't know what people are going to pay you for. You don't know how to grow your business, and you need to figure out all of those, and this is going to be a long journey.

(00:19:11):
Now, the longest part is usually figuring out product market fit and product market fit is really simple. That means that you create value to your customers. If you do not figure out product market fit, you will die. As simple as that. You never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died. That's it. Now, once they do, and for a second I want you to think of, with all the applications that you're using every day, right? From searching Google, using Waze, WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, whatever it is, and ask yourself what is the difference between any of those today and the first time that you have used that? And the answer is that there is no difference. We are searching Google today the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life. We're using Waze today the same way that we used Waze for the first time in their life. So once a company figure out product market fit, they don't change their product anymore because this is the value that they created to the customers and you don't want to change that.

(00:20:14):
What we don't know is how long did it take them to get to this point, right? Beforehand we never heard of them and after that they don't change that anymore. It's a matter of years. For Waze, it was four years. For Microsoft, it was five years. For Netflix, it was 10 years. Now if you'll tell me, "Oh, today is very different. ChatGPT just started a year ago." No, they're seven years old. It took them six years until you heard about them for the first time in your life. So it does take time to create value and this is something that is really significant. Now, at the end of the day, product market fit have one metric. One metric. That's it. Retention. That's really simple. If you create value, they will come back. If they're not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. Now think about your episodes, right, of this podcast, right? Most of your listeners are returning, right? Because you create value for them and they are coming back. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
100%. Every single one, every episode.

Uri Levine (00:21:29):
Occasionally there are new one, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):
And there's new ones coming in all the time.

Uri Levine (00:21:32):
[inaudible 00:21:32]. By the way, this is one thing that some businesses don't realize, whether or not their customers are going to be new customers or returning customers, and in many cases they simply fail to realize that upfront and the result is that they are not building the right go-to-market strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
We covered a lot of ground there. That was amazing. I'm going to follow a number of threads of things you just touched on. You talked about product market fit briefly. What was the moment you felt product market fit with Waze? I don't know if I've ever heard that story.

Uri Levine (00:22:09):
We started in Israel and Israel is a small place and we ended up with being very successful in Israel and then we said, "Wait a minute. Waze crowdsource all the data, right?" Not just the traffic information and speed cams and so forth, but also the map data itself, so we can start from a blank page. And the users while they drive, they create the map and they create traffic information and so forth. And so we figure out that we can start anywhere and we made Waze global at the end of 2009 and we expect that to work the same way that it did in Israel, but it didn't. It was not good enough. It was not good enough in the U.S. It was not good enough in Western Europe. It was not good enough in Latin America, it was not good enough in Asia. It was not good enough anywhere that matters, right?

(00:22:57):
It was actually good enough in about four places. In the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Latvia and Ecuador, and that's about it. Rest of the world not good enough. So what we did is we spoke with the drivers. Look, they wanted us to be successful. We basically said the drivers are going to fight traffic jams together, so common enemy, togetherness, all goodness. Everyone wanted that to work, right? So people downloaded the app and it simply was not good enough. So they churned, right, because if it's not good enough, you're not coming back. We spoke with them. We asked them what didn't work for them. They told us because they wanted it to work, and we built the next version addressing everything that they've told us, and we know that this is it, and it's not. So we doing it all over again. We speak with the drivers. We ask them what didn't work for them, they tell us. Now we build the next version and now we have the conviction that it's going to work and it's not. Journey of failures.

(00:23:58):
Iteration after iteration after iteration after iteration. More than a year of iterations until beginning of 2011 that we actually started to see that working, and then it's in multiple places. In the U.S., one metropolitan after the other, right? Los Angeles first and then San Francisco and then Washington D.C. and Chicago and New York and Atlanta and so forth. In Europe, one country after the other. Italy first and then France and Netherlands and Sweden and Spain and one country after the other. In Latin America, one country after the other. Colombia first and then Chile and then Brazil and then Mexico and then rest of Latin America. In Asia, multiple countries one after the other. Not all of them, by the way. Not all of them. Japan is a very good example where it didn't work and it will never work. Waze crowdsourced the information, right? Which basically says that as soon as we get to the level of good enough, then we are good enough.

(00:25:01):
House numbering plan. In the U.S., it's really simple, right? Every block is a hundreth numbers, right? And so if I have the map, I can actually count the number of blocks and take you to approximate the right location even if I don't have exactly all the house numbers there. Most of the western world, it's a geographical order. So in Israel, this is going to be sequential order, odd number on one side of the street, even number on the other side of the street starting from one until the end of the street and so forth, so it's enough that I will have few house numbers that I can actually take you to the right place.

(00:25:38):
In the UK, house number starts on one side off the street and then on the other side they are coming back, right? And so there is an order. In Japan, it's chronological order. The oldest house in the neighborhood is house number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Oh, wow.

Uri Levine (00:25:56):
And then the house number two can be miles away, but it's the second oldest house in the neighborhood and so you have to have all the house numbers unless... Until then you are not good enough. And crowdsource is, if you need perfect information, crowdsource may not be the right way to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
Just to close the loop on this question, when you were launching these markets and it wasn't working, were you actually looking at retention at that point, and if so, was there a number you were looking for? Or was it more qualitative like it's just taken off off into the right. Like where were you actually watching back in the early days?

Uri Levine (00:26:32):
That was easier for us because we tried to compare everything to Israel, so we looked at the frequency of use or when our people are coming back. How long does it take them until the next try and until the next try. And in generally speaking, if you look at something that have high frequency of use, then you will be looking at three-month retentions of 30, 40, 50% is actually pretty good indication. But usually what would happen is that you would know when they convert and that's going to be after the third or the fourth time, and if they're not getting to the fourth time, then they are basically saying, "Okay. We gave it a try. We really like this story. We gave it another try, and it's not good enough."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):
That's a cool heuristic. Do you find that that is useful for other startups, consumer-type startups or is that just something you think specific to Waze at that point, this idea of coming back for the third time?

Uri Levine (00:27:29):
It's really depending on the frequency of use, right? If I will tell you that I have a startup that helps you to file your tax returns in three minutes, then okay, that's absolutely amazing, but you are only going to do that, next time is next year. By the way, we did have a startup that was doing that. It's still a little bit up and running, but that was really frustrating because the tax authority shut us down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):
You got to fall in with the problem. You got to power through that. Just change the government. Just kidding. The story you told of Waze and iterating is a really good example of falling in love with the problem. You're really passionate about. I want to solve traffic, I hate traffic. By the way, what it made me think about a little bit is Elon, when he hated traffic, he built the boring company and built tunnels underground, and your solution to hate traffic is I'm going to build Waze in a soft wrap.

Uri Levine (00:28:29):
We start Waze with the vision that we are going to help people to avoid traffic jams. Now the reality is that there are more traffic jams today than there were in 2007. Obviously, number one, I'm not done. And number two, if you ask people what is the value of Waze, then it's not about avoiding traffic. It's about creating certainty and certainty is way higher value than saving time. So you know exactly when you're going to get there and this is a way higher value. And by the way, we learned that in the U.S. market when we spoke with people. They told us, "If I am living in Cupertino and I need to drive up to San Francisco and I can take 101 or 280, I don't really want to change my route unless there is something dramatic, but what I really want to know is how long it's going to take me. So I'm going to stay on the 101. I'm not going to get into service road. I'm not going to take El Camino Real. I'm not going to try something else. I'm going to stay on the 101. Just let me know how long it's going to take." So certainty creates way more value than saving time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
I want to talk through a couple other of the chapters in your book. So chapter four is around the different phases of a startup journey and your core advice is that it's important to focus on one thing at a time in each of these phases, and the first phase, you call it the all over the place phase, I think, or yeah, the all over phase, and the idea is you need to get out of that as soon as you can and then focus. Can you just kind of talk through these different phases and what you think people do wrong along the phases? Maybe they get them wrong or they focus on the wrong things in each phase.

Uri Levine (00:30:17):
So initially you think about your new idea from multiple perspective, right? This is the problem. This is how this solution is going to look like. This is what I'm going to do next year. This is my 10 years vision. This is my business model and so forth. So you think about everything, but you actually need to execute only one thing. Now this one thing is figuring out product market fit. It's not one thing, right? Wait a minute. You also need to build an organization and you want that organization to be something that you really like and so there are a lot of operational stuff, but you need to figure out product market fit. As we said earlier, if you don't figure out product market fit, you will die. If you do, then you get to live and die another day and the other day is whether or not you're going to figure out how to grow your business and whether or not you're going to figure out your business model.

(00:31:11):
Now the good news is that I will tell you that if you create value, you will figure out a business model, at least for the people that you create value for them. They are most likely willing to pay. Now in general, I'm not saying that this is the only business model that is viable, but if you create value, you will figure out a business model. But figuring out a business model is a journey by itself, and guess what? It's going to be a long roller coaster journey of failures. When we started Waze, we thought that we're going to sell map data and traffic information and we ended up with doing advertisement. Very different business model. Because we realized that it's not for us. It's too long sales cycles. We were very mobile internet dynamic company and selling to government is not exactly what we wanted to do, and so we ended up with a different business model, but with a lot of reasoning why this is the right business model for us.

(00:32:14):
And figuring out growth, look, if I would ask a hundred people on the street, how did you hear about Waze? They, 95 of them, if not 99 of them, will tell me, "Someone told me." Word-of-mouth, right? So everyone wants to have word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth you can only have if you have high frequency of use. If you're doing tax returns once a year, even if you really like the experience, then once a year you're going to tell someone else. If you're using Waze every day, then every day you have an opportunity to tell someone else. So word-of-mouth, even though that everyone would like that, it's only going to happen if you have high frequency of use.

(00:33:01):
So those phases requires different focus of the company, right? Initially if you focus on product market fit, then you don't need sales. You have no product to sell. You don't need business development. You don't need even marketing. You need product. You need developers and you need product lead to define the product and lead through the iterations of the product until we get to the level that it's good enough. Once you get there, you shift gears. If the product doesn't change, if we search Google the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life, then the product development is now not going to be focused about value creation. It's going to be focused about either figuring out business model or figuring out scale, and the entire company shift gears and move to a different phase.

(00:33:54):
Now, this is really hard. Just think about it. If up until now the product development group was the only things that matters, all of a sudden we think about marketing now because we are now in the go-to-market phase that this is the most important thing of the company. Occasionally I found companies that have challenging and shifting gears so they didn't figure out where the clutch is and you have to because otherwise you're stuck in the previous phase that you kind of finished that journey. This journey is nearly done and you need to shift gears, and if you don't do that, then you get stuck. If you do that, if you try to do multiple things at the same time, you will fail. Focus is not about what we are doing, it's about what we are not doing. These are the hard decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
I like that. So the four phases, just to briefly summarize, it's kind of like come up with the idea, find product market fit, then it's a question of should you keep focusing on growth or should you figure out the business model before focusing heavily on growth? In your advice, it sounds like if it's high frequency, word-of-mouth driven, focus on growth and then you figure out business model later. If not, figure out how you're going to make money and then figure out growth.

Uri Levine (00:35:14):
Exactly. Because if you have high frequency of use, you will end up with growth coming by itself, right, for word-of-mouth, and therefore you should do that at the beginning. If you don't have high frequency of use, you are sentenced to acquire users or customers all of your lifetime. If this is the case, then you really want to figure out the business model before you start and go and do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):
That's really helpful. I think actually a counter example to your point about how frequency of use is necessary for word-of-mouth growth is Airbnb. Something like 70% of Airbnb growth is word-of-mouth and frequency of use is actually really low. It's like once or twice a year. I wonder if it's because the experience is so unique and special that it still works and enough people travel enough times, slash if it was a higher frequency, it would've grown even faster, I imagine.

Uri Levine (00:36:09):
High frequency of use is the simplest way for word-of-mouth. The other thing is coolness. If it's really cool, then you'll tell more people, and Airbnb was really cool at the beginning of the journey, so now everyone knows about Airbnb, but when they started that was way cheaper and really unique experience than hotels.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
It's still actually mostly word-of-mouth. I think it was probably higher initially, but it's still almost 70, 80% driven by word-of-mouth. So it's still cool enough. Good for them. You have a couple of quotes that I wanted to share, which are along the lines of things you shared. One is just, you have this kind of, what's the most important stage at a company? They all are, but one at a time. I love that line. The other is the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. The same advice you just shared. Just like focus. So you're in the PM, product market fit phase. Focus on that. Don't think about growth yet. Don't think about business model yet necessarily. I know investors are going to push you to figure these things out and you'll have to have some story of like, "Here's how it might make money. Here's how we think we're going to grow." Right? You need to think about that a little bit, but maybe don't make that the focus.

Uri Levine (00:37:22):
So this is one of the areas that investors don't like to hear the truth, right? The truth is that I don't know how I'm going to bring the users. I will figure that out once I get there, but the reality is that right now I don't know, but they don't want to hear that. What they want to hear is that, "Oh, I know exactly how I'm going to bring them." And what I will say is that I know exactly where I'm going to start my experiments, but most of the investors would like to see a coherent story that makes sense, right? This is our business model. This is how we going to make money. This is what we're going to sell. This is how much they're going to pay. This is why it's a simple business model and these are the comparable to this business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
Yeah. But investors have the final word, unfortunately. They decide if they want to invest or not, and so if your story is not compelling, they're going to be like, "All right. We'll find someone else."

Uri Levine (00:38:13):
You know, it's seasonality, right? There are periods of time that raising capital is easier and then many of the entrepreneurs will be choosers are not beggars, and there are periods of time that is that way around, and most of the entrepreneurs will be beggars and not choosers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B.

(00:39:24):
In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to LinkedIn.com/podLenny to claim your credit. That's LinkedIn.com/podLenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:39:52):
Let's actually talk about fundraising as a topic I wanted to spend a little time on. How much money have you raised for the companies that you've started total, roughly?

Uri Levine (00:40:02):
So Waze raised about $50 million throughout the entire journey. We started by raising 12. That was the first investment round, and then we raised the 30, and then there was the last round that we raised actually not a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
That's a surprising small amount of money to raise for the outcome.

Uri Levine (00:40:28):
In general, I would say Israeli startups are leaner than American startups, so you can raise less money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
Yeah, that's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:37):
At way lower valuation, unfortunately, and end up with pretty successful results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):
That's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:45):
Raising capital, it's a journey by itself and different from the other journeys that you need only once. Raising capital is going to happen multiple times. And if we say that building a startup is a roller coaster journey, then I will say raising capital is a roller coaster journey in the dark.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
It's like Space Mountain.

Uri Levine (00:41:09):
Yeah, sort of. And one of the reason is that this is a different ballgame and you don't know how to play at the beginning. I would say a few things about raising capital for the first time. Number one, I spoke with many investors and one of the conversations that I had that they really, really resonate with me was when I spoke with one of the leading VC in Israel and asked their partner, "How long does it take you to decide if you like the entrepreneur or not?" And he asked me, "Do you want the right answer or the real answer?" Say, "You know, I heard the right answer so many times, give me the real answer." And we were sitting in a small meeting room, so the guy is looking at me and then looking at the door and looking at me again and say, "It's before they sit down." Say, "Oh, no, no, no. Say that again, right?"

(00:42:02):
That's the first impression. Now we all have first impression. How long does it take you to decide if you like a candidate or not? Second, you go on a date. How long does it take you to decide if you like the date? Seconds. And then maybe there are a few more minutes that you allow yourself to either change your mind or let that first impression solidifies. Now if this is the case and you're looking to raise capital, start with the strongest point at the beginning. Whatever it is, and I don't care if this is the size of the problem. This is the faction that you have. This is the team that you have built. I don't care what it is, start with that, because by the time you'll get there, they might be already setting up their mind. Then start with the strongest point at the beginning. And by the way, finish with that as well.

(00:42:53):
So this is the first conclusion. The second conclusion is that I spoke with early stage investors, those that invest the first money in. So company has a story to tell. That's about it, right? No traction, nothing yet is built and so forth, and I asked him, "Why did you decide to invest in this company and this company and this company?" And I spoke with many investors, and what I heard was actually pretty consistent. I like the CEO. I like the story. That's it. I like the CEO. I like the story. Now if this is the case, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that the CEO goes alone to the meeting. I need the headlight on me. I don't need any distractions. I don't need my team members. I don't need anything else in the room, just me. Because if I bring other people, then at the end of the day they might say, "Yeah, I like the team, but the CEO was not specific, right? Was not unique. Was not jumping out of the pages." So CEO goes along and tell the story.

(00:44:02):
The other part is that they need to tell a good story, and good story is not about facts. It's about creating emotional engagement. It's about creating the sense that the listener would like to be part of this story. And for investor, it's two things. Number one is that they want to believe that this is usable, and number two, they want to believe that you can build it and this is the story that you need to tell. Now, I would say always start with the problem, right? Because guess what? Investors are also users. If they don't think that they're going to use it, so it's relevant for them, and they don't think that they're going to use it? They will basically dismiss that. They will basically say the market is not there.

(00:44:52):
So these are two main things. The third thing is it's a different ball game, right? So if you have product and you tell the story to potential customers, the right order of magnitude is that about one third of the listeners will buy. So in a more mature company, their pipeline is going to be three eggs in order to sell at the end of the year one eggs. One third are going to say yes. In investors, it's 1%. Not one third, 1%. So you're going to hear a hundred times no until you hear one yes. And that a hundred times no is something that you need to understand from the beginning because that's really discouraging, right? You go and speak with investors and they tell you... I call that they open up the big book of excuses why not. But in general, they are not going to invest, right?

(00:45:54):
Now you look at it from the other side, a venture capital partner is likely to see between a hundred and 200 companies a year and invest in one or two. 1%. That's it. So if this is the case, then it's going to be the same case for you. One out of a hundred. If you want to increase the likelihood, learn how to tell a good story, start at the strongest point at the beginning, remember that they are users, too, so their emotional engagement is going to come through the usage, the use case, and not through how big the business is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:34):
I love the summary at the end. I love that you summarized your points, because I try to do that. You did my job. I love this phrase you have in your book, "The dance of 100 nos."

Uri Levine (00:46:44):
At the beginning you look at it and you say, "Okay, they say they decided not to invest because of X, Y, Z," right? Whatever it is, right? Google can do that in no time or the market is not big enough or the market is complex or whatever it is, and then you try to argue, and you don't know that it's useless, right? It's like you go on a date and she said no, and you try to argue, right? No, there is nothing to argue anymore, right? That's no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
Yeah. I look at a lot of startups too. I do a bunch of angel investing, and yeah, if it's not going to be a fit, it's just not going to work, and I could spend all this time trying to explain it to you, but nothing's going to change. And because there's other startups out there is a big part of it, right? You just want to pick the things you can that are the best, not necessarily things that are good ideas. I really like this idea of starting with your strongest point. That's such an important tactical piece of advice. To your point, investors make decisions really quickly, and so starting with something that really catches their attention, it makes so much sense because once you feel like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is a thing," your whole brain is starting to look at it from a, oh, yeah, okay, like you have a positive bend on everything you're hearing versus like, "No, no, no, this is never going to work and everything is already biased."

Uri Levine (00:48:00):
So I would add here another very strong advice. Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation. The most important slide of your presentation is the first slide, not the one that you think about it. The first slide. The one that says Company XYZ intro. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:29):
Wow, that's a good point.

Uri Levine (00:48:31):
The longest period of time in the presentation, this slide is going to be presented on the screen and you didn't say anything there. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):
I love that. Is there an example of someone that did that or did you do that, one of your startups? What do you put there?

Uri Levine (00:48:51):
I do that all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
What's an example of something you put on that slide that's such a good idea?

Uri Levine (00:48:56):
Maybe size of the market. Maybe description of the problem. Whatever it is, right, the strongest point is there. Now the second most important slide is the last one. Not the summary. The one that says thank you. That's the time to repeat that. So most of their presentations will end up with thank you and my email, right, and this is going to be the last slide, right? Which makes sense. You just missed the opportunity. This is going to be the second-longest displayed slide of the presentation. Maybe the first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:39):
Yeah. Everyone's sitting there chatting, asking you questions. That's so smart. Are there any more of these tips sitting in your head to share, because these are awesome.

Uri Levine (00:49:48):
I do a lot of public speaking and usually my last slide says one more story and I decide on the story based on the audience and the dialogue so far and so forth. But I have many of stories, many last stories that I would like to tell. The important part is that no one is going to cut you off the stage if you have just one more story, and so this is where you can recap everything. This is where you can do whatever you want, right? Because no one is going to tell you, "Okay, time is up."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):
Right, and they're not impatient because they're like, "Okay, it's almost over. Let's just let him finish."

Uri Levine (00:50:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:31):
Yeah. I love that. Speaking of stories, what's the wildest fundraising story that you've been through? Is there one that comes to mind of like, "Holy shit. I can't believe that happened," or, "I can't believe that worked out"?

Uri Levine (00:50:43):
One of the earlier startups that I was guiding was about, eventually rolled into gift cards, but in Israel, when you return something to the store, you don't get your money back. What you get is a gift card for that particular store, right, and obviously if you return something, then it's not necessarily that you have something to buy in the store and you ended up with having a gift card that is never being used, and so why not sell this gift card? What happened is that I heard the story of the CEO and I thought that the story is not good enough, and I told him, "Look, you have to tell a better story," and asked, "Can you give me an example?" And I said, "Yeah, just imagine that," and then there was a long story about the microwave stuff working, and I bought a new one and really long, long, long story about with the details, right? How do you make a story make believe? With details. Right? The more details people think that this is real. Right?

(00:51:48):
If there are no details, then this is not real. So I told him this story that was like five minutes explaining, trying to fit the microwave into the closet and it didn't fit in into the cabinet, and it didn't fit in, and I had to return it to the box and so forth and whole story. And then I spoke with an investor in Israel and I told him about this new company that I'm going to invest, and I told him the same story about this microwave, right, and he said, "This is interesting. I would like to meet the CEO." Then he met the CO and CEO told him exactly the same story about the microwave. When I tell that, this is my microwave, right?This is personal. This has happened to me. And so he told me, the investor called me up later, he said, "He told me exactly the same story." So that was really funny.

(00:52:44):
But at the end of the day, one of the things that makes story authentic is details, because otherwise it's not, right? If you're going to tell me, okay, this is the use case of the product and you end up with explaining a use case in three lines, this is not authentic. If you watch your real users, then what happens is that you actually, and you speak with them, then you have the audacity to tell a good story. Really, really critical. If you want to tell user story, these needs to be, real or you have to learn how to tell a story with many details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:29):
But interestingly, it sounds like the story itself doesn't have to have happened to you in real life. It could be a made-up story, but with a lot of details is the lesson there. Interesting.

Uri Levine (00:53:38):
Yep. If you tell it very briefly, then it doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Amazing. Any other advice along those lines? I want to talk about two more chapters before we wrap up. Is there anything else around fundraising that you think is important for people to know?

Uri Levine (00:53:54):
So I will tell you which chapters I would like to speak about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Let's do it. I wonder what they are. I wonder if they're the same.

Uri Levine (00:54:02):
Understanding users and firing and hiring.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:04):
Okay, firing and hiring. That was on my list. Okay. Let's start there and then understanding users wasn't, but I'm excited to hear what you have to say there.

Uri Levine (00:54:14):
So I send the book proposal to many publisher, and there is one chapter that says firing and hiring, and many of them came back and say, "Oh, it should be hiring and firing." And I said, "No. Firing is hard decision. Hiring is easy decisions." You have to first of all learn how to make the hard decisions. Now, the inspirations for this chapter came from many dialogues that I had with entrepreneurs that their startup failed, and I asked them, "Why, what happened?" And about half told me the team was not right, and I kept on asking, "Okay, what do you mean the team was not right?" And what I heard the most is, "We had this guy not good enough and this guy not good enough." So this is what I heard the most.

(00:54:58):
Another thing that I heard quite often is that we had communication issues, right? Something that I actually called ego management issues. And then asked them the most interesting question, "When did you know that the team is not right?" Now the answer was actually rather scary. All of them told me within the first month. Then you said, "Wait a minute. If you knew within the first month that the team is not right and you didn't do anything, the problem was not that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decision." Making hard decisions is hard. Making easy decisions. This is why no one likes to make the hard decisions, because you need to live with the consequences. In a small place like a startup, the hard decisions will always go to the top. Now, if the CEO does not make that hard decisions, the result is always the same. The top performing people would leave. Now, they would leave because they don't want to be in a place that is unable to make hard decisions and they have a choice.

(00:56:02):
The nature of the beast is different. Startup is a small organization. Just imagine that you are a small organization, like could be a team, whatever it is, right? 10, 20, 30 people, and there is someone that shouldn't be there, and I don't care if that someone shouldn't be there because they are way underperforming or because they are assholes. I don't really care. They shouldn't be there. Everyone knows. Everyone knows and the CEO doesn't do anything. That's the nature of the beast and this is why top performing people would leave. Now, building a startup is really, really hard, right? It's hard if you have the right team, but if you have people that shouldn't be there that are still there and the top performing people are leaving, then it's going to be mission impossible. The conclusion of this chapter is really, really interesting. If everyone knows within a month and every time that you hire someone new, what I really want you to do is mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?"

(00:57:16):
At the end of the day, I'd like to nail that into yes or no, right? Because this is where decisions are being made easily. If you ask yourself that question, if the answer is yes, then go to this person and tell them that you are really excited that they've joined, they are exceeding your expectations, and give them more equity, and you buy their loyalty for life. If the answer is no, fire them immediately. They're already set on a trajectory of not being successful and they're creating damage to you, to the rest of the team and to themselves, right? They deserve to be successful, but it's not going to happen here. They deserve to find someplace else that they can be successful, but it's not going to happen here, and that decision is really, really dramatic.

(00:58:08):
Now, in many cases with hard decisions, we know what is the right decisions. We are looking for confirmation. If you look for confirmation, then go and speak with the top performing people and tell them, ask them the following, right? "Assuming XYZ person is going to leave, how sore are you going to feel?" And you will be surprised that they are going to tell you, "Oh, it's not a big deal." This is your confirmation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:40):
Yeah. We had Elizabeth Stone from Netflix, the CTO of Netflix on, and she talked about this thing they called a keeper test, which is exactly that, where every manager is always asking themselves, "If this person were to leave tomorrow and tell me they're leaving, would I fight to keep them? And if not, I should just, I need to let them go," and that's always top of mind for managers there.

Uri Levine (00:58:59):
You know, one of my companies had a pretty good year and they decided to have an annual bonuses by and large to nearly all of the employees. And then I asked the CEO, "So how did you end up with the list?" And he said, "Okay. We had these people that getting twice as much the others, and then the others, and then there are four people that are not going to get anything." And I asked them, "Are they still here?" They shouldn't be here, right? If they are so much underperforming, then they shouldn't be here. But generally you need the time to ask yourself the tough questions because only then you can answer them, right? If you don't ask the tough questions, then you don't answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):
Yeah. I really love this very tactical piece of advice, which I was definitely going to touch on, of putting a calendar entry into your calendar when you hire someone 30 days in to remind yourself, asking yourself, "Would I hire this person knowing what I know now? And if not, you should probably let them go."

Uri Levine (01:00:06):
By the way, I can tell you that for everything in your life, right? Everything in your life, ask yourself, "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Wow.

Uri Levine (01:00:17):
If the answer is yes, then do something different today. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):
That is powerful advice. So what I'm thinking there is if I bought something, maybe return it. What else have you applied that to in your life?

Uri Levine (01:00:31):
Relationship in general. Directions that you're going, right? Do you still like that? I have five children and they're all in their twenties and beginning of thirties and they struggle with their career path, and I basically tell them, "Look, if you are going to work in a place and you don't like it, then what I want you to do is ask yourself why you are not liking it and whether or not there is something that you can change, and I'm going to ask you the same question in 90 days from now, and if this still is the case, then quit."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):
It's interestingly you make that 90 days, which it kind of applies some decisions. You need to wait a little bit more. You need more data. You need more time than necessarily 30 days, but set some kind of timeline.

Uri Levine (01:01:24):
If you don't set a timeline, it'll never happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):
I think the other really interesting implication here is most decisions are a two-way door. Most decisions, you can change your mind. You can quit. You can leave a relationship. I was thinking you were going to say with your five kids 30 days after they're born, "Do I still want this kid 30 days with knowing what I know now?" I'm glad you didn't go there.

Uri Levine (01:01:52):
No, this is different, right? You go into this journey of having children with the understanding that this is long journey. Go into this journey of building a startup with the understanding that this is a long journey, right? The fact that it's going to be hard? Okay, so it's hard. It is hard, by the way. But yeah, the decisions that obviously they need to be relative to their duration, right? So yeah, raising kids is a long journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
And a one-way door, also. Is there anything else you wanted to say around the hiring and firing concept? Clearly firing is the main lesson here, is get really good at firing, firing quickly and decisively.

Uri Levine (01:02:41):
You know, there are tons of advices in the book and eventually I will tell, even in the hiring process, right, most of us are going to interview candidates and then decide that they like or dislike the candidate, but they don't know. Then speak with someone that does know. Speak with the reference.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:02):
Do you have a favorite question you like to ask references? Is there something that you find is really helpful to tell you? Give you honest insight?

Uri Levine (01:03:09):
For reference?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
Yeah.

Uri Levine (01:03:11):
That's really simple. Would you hire him? Or would you hire her, right? So essentially at the end of the day you want to nail it into yes or no.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:26):
Yeah. And hope that they're being honest. That's sometimes a challenge.

Uri Levine (01:03:31):
No, if they will tell me yes, then I would ask them, "Why didn't you?" Someone asked me for a reference on someone that I really enjoyed working with. I really think highly of them, and he asked me if they can schedule a call for half an hour and I said, "Look, I'm traveling. I don't really have time. But if you want an email in one word, take the guy." And then he was trying to outsmart and ask me back, "Can I have that in two words?" And I said, "Yeah, take the guy fast." When you know, you know. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
I like that. That's what you want to be looking for. Okay. Amazing. So let's do one more chapter. The one I was going to pick, you choose what you're more excited about, is selling a company. Your last chapter exit. The one you were thinking about going to is talking to users. I imagine that's much more applicable to more people, so that's probably the better choice, but your choice.

Uri Levine (01:04:28):
Okay, then let's stick with understanding users. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, wrote the foreword to my book and he called it the Bible for entrepreneurs, and when I sent him the first chapter, he said, "Wow, I wish I had that When I started." I met Steve Wozniak for the first time about 10 years ago. We spoke at the same conference in Guatemala, and look, when I grew up, Steve Wozniak was my technological guru, right so he was the most important person in the technology space in my mind. And then we spoke at the same conference and we had dinner the night before, and the only thing that actually was really important for me is to have a selfie with my idol, right? And so I took up my iPhone and with the iPhone you can take pictures by clicking here on the screen or using the volume button on the side, right?

(01:05:34):
And so I took a selfie with him holding the phone like that and clicking on the volume button and he said, "Finally." And I said, "Finally what?" "Finally someone using it the way that I meant it to be." Now you realize that there is no right or wrong. There are different people that are using different products in different ways, and occasionally if I would have large audience, then I would ask the people, "Okay, how do you use Waze?" Right? "So you go to your destination and you enter destination, and then Waze guides you through the screen with the display of the maneuvers that needs to be made or with the audio guidance of turn right, turn left and so forth. If you are watching the screen, raise your hand." And then I would have about 70% of the people raise their hand." Then I ask people to watch around them and see those people. Then I ask, "If you are listening to the audio prompt, raise your hand." Then I have about 20 or 30 more percent of the people raising their hand. And again, I send people to watch around and see those hands.

(01:06:41):
There is no right or wrong. Different people are using it differently. Now, if you are using Waze in a certain way, up until this moment, you didn't know that there are other people that are using it differently, and to be frank, you don't care. You getting your own value the way that you get it, then you don't really care that there are other people that are getting it differently. But if you are building a product and you don't know that, then you are building the wrong product. You don't know that there are other people that are not like you, and you think that you're building the product for yourself, then you're making a big mistake. And the way to figure it out is, by the way, two things. Number one, watch new users. Simply watch users and see what they're doing. And number two, if they're not doing what you expect them to do, then ask them why, because this why is the one that is going to make your product successful. You understand the why and the next version you're going to address that.

(01:07:42):
Now, this is in particular when it comes to understanding users. Obviously there are a lot of users, but we can group them into several groups of their ability to adapt something new, and something new is not necessarily new technology. We think about it as a new technology, but it's not necessarily about technology. It's about new behavior, right? And then we look at the entire population and every time that we look into large numbers, they will have normal distribution, right? So the bell curve of the distribution, and then we will have about 2% of the populations that they're the innovatives. The innovatives are going to use something new because it's new. That's it. They care about this subject and they going to be the first one to hear about it and they're going to try that out because it's new. The second group is usually what we will get to see as the first users are the early adapters. As soon as they realize that there is value, they're going to give it a try. And if there is value, then they will keep on using it, and if there is no value, then they will quit. Right?

(01:08:55):
The third group is the most important group. This is where market leaders are, right? This is called the early majority. This is about one third of the population, and the one that wins the early majority wins the market. The challenge with this group, with the people in this group, is that they're afraid of change. So their state of mind is, don't rock the boat. Whatever I'm currently doing is good enough for me. So if you have Salesforce.com, which is absolutely amazing, their reaction is going to be, "What's wrong with Excel?" And because they're afraid of change, they are not going to try something new. Now the reason is that at the end of the day, they're afraid that this is going to be too complex for them and they will not get it, and they don't want to be embarrassed and they don't want to feel like idiots. And guess what? People don't like to feel like idiots, and so they are not going to try. And you need to see those people to understand their barriers for starting to use your service.

(01:10:02):
And by the way, the solution is always the same. Simplicity. Leonardo da Vinci said that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. If you want to make it simple, in your journey of building a product, we basically say this is iteration to iteration to iteration. In many of those you add features and you add features and you add features until you all of a sudden you add the features that people are using. What you really want to do next is remove the rest of the features that people are not using because they're adding complexity. Now, most of the product owners, they're either innovators or early adopters. You cannot understand an early majority person. If you belong to one group, you cannot understand a person from that group unless you watch them and [inaudible 01:10:57]. So the most important part of understanding users is actually seeing those users. And they are not wrong. This is how they behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):
So a couple of threads there I'll pull out. One is look for surprising uses of your product because, as you said, you'll realize, "Oh, some people are using this in a way that I didn't expect," and it'll remind you people are not the way you are and don't assume that they're going to want exactly what you're building, so pay attention to things that surprise you. We had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast and he talked through a lot of this stuff, and one of the lessons there to help you bridge that gap from, to the, what is it, the third group? How did you describe it? The late majority?

Uri Levine (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Uri Levine (01:11:44):
Late majority will never use the product. They will use your product only if they have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):
Yeah. The laggards, I think he calls it. They look for basically references. People telling them, "Hey, you really need to use this." A lot of people, just like basically word-of-mouth is the way you described it.

Uri Levine (01:11:58):
No, not just word-of-mouth. Even occasionally someone to show them how to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):
Yeah. That makes sense. Just like, "Here, check out Waze. Here's how it works." Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Amazing. Is there anything else along those lines as you're talking to customers and understanding what you're looking for that you want to share?

Uri Levine (01:12:17):
Occasionally what happens is that we speak with the wrong customers. So just imagine that we have what I call funnel of use, right? So on top of the funnel, we have people that are download the app, let's say, or have entered their website, and then the next phase is that they registered and the next phase that they're trying to use it for the first time and then the next phase is that they're getting the value and they're coming back, right? In this funnel, what we usually try to do is speak with the users at the bottom of the funnels, those that were successful. But in order to improve, we need to speak with those that fail, those that were unsuccessful, those that did not register, or they did register and did not use, or they did use and did not come back, because they know something that we really need to know. Why? This why is what makes a great product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):
Interesting. I imagine you could also fall into danger there if people that just aren't a fit for your product, there's just no point wasting your time on people that are just not going to be a fit. So is the idea there find people that are really far down the funnel but still bounced and churned?

Uri Levine (01:13:34):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
Awesome. Amazing. Okay. So we've gone through all the chapters I was hoping to go through, plus the ones you were excited about. Final thing before we get to our very exciting lightning round, we have a segment on this podcast called Fail Corner, where I ask a guest to share a time they failed in their career and what they learned from that experience, and I'm curious if there is a story that comes to mind of a time that you failed either in a startup or as you were an employee somewhere and how that was important to you.

Uri Levine (01:14:05):
So number one, I reserve the right for my biggest failure yet to come. And look, I keep on trying new things. I keep on doing things, and so eventually I will fail as much as... Maybe I'm more successful statistically than others, but I will fail, and this is very, very important part to realize. Don't be afraid to fail, right? In your journey, you're going to fail multiple times, and when you fail and get up, you get up stronger. This is maybe something that I will tell all the parents in the world. The biggest advice that I can give you is teach your children to fail. Because when they get up, they get up stronger, and when they know that they will get out of their comfort zone and they will eventually discover what makes them happy. At the end of the day, as parents, there's only one thing that we really like. We want our kids to be happy in their own way. We don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. We want them to explore, and they will only explore if they are not afraid to fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
Yeah. This is a very timely advice for me because our kid is always falling down and it's always this balance between helping them not fall and letting them figure things out.

Uri Levine (01:15:27):
Let them fall. There is a Japanese saying, fall seven times and get up eight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Uri Levine (01:15:43):
No, I think that was actually, I really enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):
Amazing. Well, we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Uri Levine (01:15:50):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people other than your own book?

Uri Levine (01:15:58):
Mark Randolph of Netflix. That Will Never Work, right? And by the way, it's funny. Mark Randolph wrote endorsement to my book and I reached out to him because I read someplace that he's answering all of his emails, and I reached, I sent him an email and said, "Look, we have at least three things in common. Number one, I do answer all of my emails as well. Number two, I'm using your product, you are using mine. And number three, I heard more time that will never work than you did." And I think that understanding this journey is really, really important, so this is definitely a book that I would recommend. Atomic Habits. Getting habits and improving them, measuring and improving, is really, really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Very cool choices. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Uri Levine (01:17:02):
I don't watch a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Easy, then. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Uri Levine (01:17:11):
So I can bet that most of the people say the ChatGPT, but actually no. I recently downloaded the Chess App and I returned to play chess with the computer or something that I haven't done for so many years, and I really enjoy that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Amazing. It's actually, I don't think ChatGPT has ever been recommended. Recent choices have been a beautiful Persian rug, a Rivian, a very nice Mercedes, and I think recently it was a course on nervous system regulation.

Uri Levine (01:17:48):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:49):
All over the place. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find really useful in work, your own life? It may be the one on your shirt, but is there any other that you come back to often and find useful?

Uri Levine (01:18:03):
Don't be afraid to fail. I think that in many cases we need to accept the fact that we don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):
Important words. Final question, is there a problem you're starting to fall in love with more recently, maybe tinkering with a new startup idea? Or are you done with starting companies?

Uri Levine (01:18:21):
I probably will never be done. I have 10 different startups in multiple areas. One of them, Pontera helps people to retire richer, which is one of the biggest challenges in the world in general, but also in the U.S. If I would ask a hundred people on the street that have 401k plans, "What is your 401k plan invested at?" 95% of them will tell me, "I don't know." I do know, by the way. In the default. Whatever was the default when they joined, right? Now obviously if you didn't do anything and you think it's right, no, it's not right. It's probably simply not enough. So this is a big problem. I have one in the medical space that is trying to create, I would call that the AI of the medical knowledge, so trying to improve doctors, and in particular in clinical decisions. That is going to change the world.

(01:19:27):
But if you would ask me, then I will give you some examples, right? So mobility is still a problem, right? You look at many areas in our lifetime and mobility is still, every year it's, instead of getting better, it's getting lesser. So mobility is still a problem. And medical services, right? U.S. medical services are five to 10 times more expensive than they are in Germany. Now, it's not that they're better. They're simply more expensive. So obviously you ask yourself, "Okay, where is this inefficiency? Where is it?" Right? A lot of places of inefficiency in the medical services if they're so expensive. Education. Okay. Anything that I will tell you that we are still doing the same way that our parents did is probably something that we need to revisit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:22):
I feel like I nerd sniped you with falling in love with problems. Clearly fall in love with a lot of problems. You want to solve them all. You're addicted to startups.

Uri Levine (01:20:29):
The good news is that there are a lot of problems and the bad news that there are lots of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:34):
And you're there to solve it. I love it. Uri, your book is amazing. It's incredibly practical, full of tons of advice that every founder should read, and it goes from idea all the way to exit. So basically, no matter where you're on the journey, the book is going to be useful to you. Tell people where to find it and where they can follow you for more stuff that you share over time, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Uri Levine (01:20:56):
So obviously this is the book. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, basically places that you can find it. You can follow me on LinkedIn. This is pretty much the only network that I'm actually engaged. If you read the book, then you will find my email in the book and then you can email me, as well. And I do answer all of my emails. I want you to read the book. I don't want you to buy the book. I want you to read the book. And the reason is that I have a purpose in life and this is creating value, and I believe that this book is going to be the best return on investment that you ever made. Not the $20 or $30 that it costs, but the time that you're going to spend on reading it, and therefore, I can be valuable for you, and if I can be valuable for you, then I serve my purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):
Amazing. If you weren't on YouTube watching this, the book is called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, if you're trying to Google it and find that on Amazon. And Uri, thank you so much for being here.

# A founder’s guide to crisis management | Uri Levine (Waze co-founder, serial entrepreneur)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's talk about crisis. I think it might be helpful to do a quick taxonomy of the types of crisis founders face.

Uri Levine (00:00:05):
So two, abstractly, two types of crisis. One is I would call that a cash crisis. All of a sudden, your cash program or plan is being jeopardized, losing a customer, disappearing investor. And the other one is lose of product market fit. When product market fit disappear, you actually need to go back to square one. Then you basically say everything that I know so far is irrelevant anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
You also talk along these lines of never give up in a crisis and throughout your journey.

Uri Levine (00:00:35):
Always keep on looking for ways to make it work. Never give up is the most important behavior of successful CEOs of startup. The second one, by the way, is making decisions with conviction. If you don't make them with conviction, then the team is not going to follow. If the team is not going to follow, then you are not going to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
The core part of your advice on crisis, it's always the founders fault if things don't work out.

Uri Levine (00:00:57):
At the end of the day, you cannot rely on someone else, you have only one company, you need to make sure that this company is successful. When you assume responsibility, you're basically saying, "You know what, I control my own destiny."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Any advice for how to avoid falling into a crisis as a founder?

Uri Levine (00:01:14):
Number one answer is no, don't worry, you will face crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):
Today, my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze, along with nine other companies. He's sold two companies for over a billion dollars, he's been on 20 different startup boards, has been an advisor to over 50 different startups. And even more impressively, this is his second time on the podcast.

(00:01:39):
In our first conversation, we walked through the biggest lessons that he's learned over the course of working with all of these different startups that he chronicled in his beloved book, Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. In this conversation, we go deep on one very specific topic, crisis. As Uri shares in his book, building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next. And my goal with this conversation is to give you tools to handle the next crisis and the next crisis and the next crisis that you face as a founder. This topic is so important that Uri decided to update and re-release his book with a whole new chapter dedicated to managing crisis. And this new edition is actually going to launch right around the time this episode launches.

(00:02:17):

(00:02:30):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.

(00:02:53):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

(00:03:24):
If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:03:49):
This episode is brought to you by Rippling, a single platform to build and scale your startup on. Rippling handles all the can't get it wrong admin work of payroll and benefits, giving you back hours every week. But it does a lot more than that. Rippling is a game changer for the entire company with tools for HR, IT and spend all built from the ground up and designed to work together seamlessly.

(00:04:13):
Just hired someone, Rippling makes onboarding easy whether your new hire is sitting next to you or halfway across the world. In just a few clicks, Rippling automatically generates an offer letter, ships a laptop with the necessary apps and permissions and even delivers a corporate card. An employee needs to update their benefits contribution, when they do it in Rippling, the change automatically syncs to payroll. CTO forgot her laptop in an Uber, lock it remotely with Rippling.

(00:04:38):
Many startups I've invested in like Sprig, Ellamy and ClassDojo use Rippling because it's a force multiplier for lean teams, helping them eliminate major headaches and operate their business more efficiently. For a limited time, Rippling is giving Lenny's listeners three months off. To redeem, visit rippling.com/lenny. That's rippling.com/lenny.

(00:05:03):
Uri, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Uri Levine (00:05:06):
Thank you. I'm really happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:08):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast, this is your second time here, which is a pretty rare feat. And the reason that you're back is, the first time we chatted in depth about your amazing book. I have it right here, Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. And you decided to re-release the book recently with a new chapter about something that every single founder is going to go through. You actually have this quote I'll read that I think is a good summary of why this is so important. "That building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next." Let me just start with this question of why did you decide to add this chapter, why is it so important to update your book?

Uri Levine (00:05:43):
End of the day, recent years have demonstrated major significant crisises throughout the world, from Covid to interest rate, to inflation, to wars. And then I realized that wait a minute, this is something that I haven't spoke about during my first book and it's time to write a new edition to that or a new chapter that will be added into the new release. And so this is about crisis. And in addition, my publisher told me that, "Oh, you should have a paperback, it's going to sell more and more people are going to read it because it's easier to read." So I do have the new edition already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:25):
There is?

Uri Levine (00:06:26):
It will be published in about a month and it does include a new chapter. And it's a paperback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:34):
I love that you're solving the jobs to be done, make it easier to read, we'll make it paperback. I also, as you described it, it made me realize the reason your book is so great is it's basically a step-by-step guide of all the things you need to know about building a successful company. And what it feels like is you just realize, oh, I forgot this step that every founder goes through, which is crisis.

Uri Levine (00:06:54):
Multiple crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Multiple crisis, we'll get into that. Also, I love that you can actually update a book. Usually people are like, "Oh, books, done." You move on. I love that you have the opportunity actually to update a book. That's inspiring.

Uri Levine (00:07:08):
I'm already thinking of the next one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:11):
The next book or the next update to the book?

Uri Levine (00:07:15):
Not sure yet, not sure. Look, at the end of the day, there is a reason for me to write the book. I wrote the book in order to make a bigger impact. I'm an entrepreneur and everyone knows that, so I built Waze and Moovit and dozens of other startups, but I'm also a teacher. So I feel equally rewarded when I build something myself or I guide someone to build it. And the book is fulfilling my destiny as a teacher, sharing my know-how with entrepreneurs, with business people, with pretty much everyone to help them to become more successful.

(00:07:50):
So the realization that what I really want is people to take out of the book is something that will increase their likelihood of being successful. And the next book is going to be pretty much the same, with the same philosophy of wait a minute, if I can make a bigger impact, I would like to make a bigger impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:13):
It's a beautiful mission. I think we're going to do that. Let's talk about crisis. Maybe to make this very real and visceral for people to get a sense of, you hear the word crisis, you're like, oh yeah, sure. Can you maybe share a story of a crisis that you experienced that might be illustrative of the types of crisis that founders face across the many companies you've started and advised, what comes to mind?

Uri Levine (00:08:34):
Covid was an excellent example. And one of my startups back then, called Order.chat, and actually it was the first AI chat back in 2020. And that was meant to help people to make reservations to restaurants. As simple as, "Oh, I would like to make a reservations for six people for tomorrow night at XYZ restaurant." And that chat was actually very, very successful in Israel. And the reason is that we actually built an engine that had facing the user with a chat but also facing the restaurant with a chat. So we did not require any integration, we could go online anywhere and actually cover all the restaurants in no time. And that turned out to be pretty successful and then Covid hit. And guess what? All the restaurants were shut down for hosting guests and there were no more reservations for restaurants.

(00:09:41):
Now we were really good at that, but we did not have enough funding to actually pivot into something completely different. And the result is that we had to shut it down. And still people still ask me what happened to that? What happened to that was Covid.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
I feel like Covid happened to a lot of companies. And it feels like that's kind of an impetus to this chapter. I think you even said that, it created so many crisis across so many companies you were involved with, helped you realize a lot of companies and founders are just not prepared.

Uri Levine (00:10:13):
So by and large I would say end of the day, we look at the global crisises and we say, "Oh, this is going to impact an industry." But as an entrepreneur, you don't care about the industry, you care about your own startup, that's it. And if the rest of the world is suffering from the same problem, doesn't help you, not even a single bit. So your problem is your problem, that's it.

(00:10:39):
And then you need to abstract that and basically realize, okay, wait a minute, I will define a crisis as something that you already had that is significant, disappears. So let's say that you already have millions of dollars in revenues and all of a sudden your biggest customer decide not to continue and you lose half of your revenues. All of a sudden you basically say, "Wait a minute, I have to adapt, something significant happened."

(00:11:10):
And that something significant is that your revenues disappear or maybe your funding disappeared or maybe ... So in general, the first type of crisis will be around cash. All of a sudden your cash is not the same as you expected, something happened, maybe funding, maybe revenues, maybe projection, maybe you lost a big customers, a cash crisis. And then you need to adapt.

(00:11:43):
The second one, which is even more significant, is that you lost product market fit. And that might happen, it might happen because of regulations, because of competition, because of something dramatic happened that there is no more value into your product. And we are going back to basic, product market fit is very simple. That means that you create value to your customers, this is what it is. And you never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died, that's it.

(00:12:20):
And by the way, product market fit in general have only one metric, only one metric, retention. Look, it's really simple, if you create value, they will come back, that's it. If they are not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. And so in your startup journey, this is going to be the first phase, and it's going to require a lot of iterations and it's a journey of failures. So we're going to try something and it doesn't work, we're going to try something else. And we keep on trying until we find one thing that does work.

(00:12:54):
But once you figure that out, you're ready to move to the next part of your journey. But what if it's all disappeared? What if all of a sudden someone changed their regulation? Someone you rely on, a very unique data, that you were able to build and all of a sudden someone create a way to access this data for everyone. What if there is a competitor that makes you irrelevant?

(00:13:22):
I'm using iPhone, obviously a lot of people using iPhone and I'm using that for a long while. iPhone is born in 2007. Before that we used to have different phones with keypads. And when iPhone was introduced, Microsoft basically say this will never work. They were in a position of a market leader, they own Windows mobile operating system that was running on pretty much all the phones in the world. All the smartphones in the world, from Nokia to Motorola, to Samsung, to pretty much everything. And they look at it and say this will never work. They haven't realized how impactful it is. So this is a competition coming out to the market with something that is completely different. And not only disrupt the market but actually create crisis for pretty much everyone else.

(00:14:15):
And the result is that today Microsoft is not a player in the mobile operating system and Nokia disappeared or pretty much disappeared and Motorola disappeared and pretty much everyone that was really significant in this industry, they were not adapted fast enough to the change. And the change was that their product market fit disappeared. Now it's not that their product all of a sudden become irrelevant, people simply wanted something else.

(00:14:48):
So when product market fit disappeared, you actually need to go back to square one. And the faster that you realize and you basically say everything that I know so far, everything that I knew so far is irrelevant anymore. Can I restart? Can I go back to square one and restart? Because if you cannot, you will die. You're following your own solution and you believe that this solution is going to be marketed better than what the market wants. And what the market wants is different.

(00:15:25):
It can be also a matter of regulation change. One of my startups called Fibo died because of change in regulation. So Fibo was doing tax returns, something that everyone hates, but we have to do that. And when we started we basically say wait a minute, when I speak with people and ask them how is tax returns being done in your country, what I heard was pretty consistent, it's either complex or expensive or both, that's it. And I said wait a minute, what if I can simplify that? What if we can make it really, really simple?

(00:16:08):
And we define simplification by filing in less than five minutes. Whatever you do, if you can do that in less than five minutes, it's simple enough. And we ended up with building a platform in Israel that people were able to file in less than three minutes. And that was actually pretty amazing. Now the result was that in about ... In Israel filing is not mandatory. So we actually enable people that were not filing up until now to file because it's simple. And we increased the size of the market by 25% over one year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:42):
Of people filing taxes?

Uri Levine (00:16:43):
Yep. Because it was simple. So you go into the platform, you realize that wait a minute, I actually entitled to get a return, so let me file. If I'm not entitled to get a return, then I'm not going to file because it's not mandatory. And the result is that we increased the load of the taxation system. And all of a sudden the Israeli tax authority didn't like us anymore and they basically shut us down. So changing the regulation and we lost product market fit overnight. They basically say, "Oh, we are going to shut you down and that's tomorrow." And that's it.

(00:17:22):
Now we did not have enough run rate to actually ... because the company was about break even, so we did not have enough funding to go and try to find something else. And we tried to fight the regulator, but fighting regulator requires a long period of time and a lot of funding and we did not have that.

(00:17:49):
So regulation might be a reason why you lose product market fit. And you need to go back to square one. And what we decided is that, okay, what I decided on a personal level is that I'm not going deal with the regulation anymore. I don't want to rely on a regulator to allow me or not allow me to do what I want to do.

(00:18:16):
By the way, with Waze, in the early days we thought that the business model is going to be selling data to authorities, to municipalities, to maybe public transportation systems and so forth. And we basically say wait a minute, we have the best traffic information in the world, I can go to a municipality and tell them how long does it take to make a left turn in each and every traffic light in the city every day of the week, every hour of the day. And therefore they can recalibrate the traffic control system and enable better utilization of the entire road system. And it turns out that this is really, really, really slow business development process. They didn't really care. And that was frustrating. Even if you offer that for free they still don't care. And the result is that we changed the business model and we ended up with advertisement. But the reality is that I don't like to work with regulators, that is all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):
Okay. There's so much here I want to dig into. One is this example, this story about losing product market fit, it reminds me of, I had Drew Houston on the podcast, the founder of Dropbox, and he described a moment where when Apple launched Apple Photos or iCloud, I think it was iCloud, he's like, "It's as if there's this mushroom cloud exploding far in the distance that you don't hear for a long time and we didn't necessarily see exactly how much this will have impacted our business." And I think that's what happens a lot of cases. You see something happen and you're like, "No, this is no problem, we're going to win anyway." Like Blackberry I think did the same thing with iPhone.

Uri Levine (00:20:01):
We had the same thing with Waze, because when we started Waze was free and it was the only one that was offering turn-by-turn navigation free. And the reason is that we created our own maps. And then one day in 2010, Google announced their free turn-by-turn navigation. Turns out that they were working for the last two years in building maps of the US. And they enabled that on Google Maps, turn-by-turn navigation with audio guidance to turn right, turn left and so forth.

(00:20:38):
And two companies were actually shocked, the entire industry, but two companies were impacted. The first one is actually TomTom. TomTom was the provider of the maps for Google to do navigation. And they basically say, "No, we have our own maps, we are going to terminate the contract." And TomTom said, "Wait a minute, you are paying us $18 million a year and we have five years contract." And Google say, "Yeah, we will keep on paying you that amount of money that we are committed, but we are not going to use your product anymore."

(00:21:11):
And that one was Waze because basically everyone in the industry told us that we are doomed. Our own investors told us that, "Look, if we can sell the company for $20 or $30 million today, do it because you are not going to be successful."

(00:21:27):
Now obviously we turned the corner and turned out to be very successful. And to that level that eventually Google acquired us. And the reason is that the use case was different. Waze was focusing on the daily commuters. So we wanted people to use our application twice a day, when you go to the office and when you come back home. And Google Maps is something that you are being used not that frequent, you are in general I would say if I ask a hundred people how often they use Waze, they will tell me every day. If I ask them how often they use Google Maps, they will tell me, "When I need it." So a different use case and obviously different product that is built for the specificity of the use case. So Waze is way simpler and the map looks almost abstractive, they're not, but looks like abstractive and way less details. And the result is the ability to create something that is simpler and people are using every day.

(00:22:34):
But when Google announced turn-by-turn navigation, all the investors in the world turn their back on us. And that was 2010. We were looking for new funding. I remember that night, because we were just about to go and meet with all partners meeting at Khosla Ventures. And we had multiple meetings beforehand and that was like, okay, this is the final seal.

(00:23:07):
And the evening before we had dinner with the partners that was promoting us at Khosla Ventures and he told us, "Look, I have a lot of relationship in the industry, and I spoke with my friends at Google and they told me that they are at least two years away from building their own maps." And the next morning they simply announced this turn-by-turn navigation. Going to that meeting was a waste of time already. And we had very, very hard time to raise capital because of that.

(00:23:38):
But eventually we were lucky in the sense that once Google announced their turn-by-turn navigation, turns out that the rest of the industry were took by surprise. And Microsoft decided that wait a minute, we don't have our own maps, so let's invest in Waze. So we ended up getting investment from someone that we did not expect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):
Okay. So first of all, you've shared all these types of crisis, I think it might be helpful to do a quick taxonomy of the types of crisis founders face. You shared regulation changes, competitors coming at you, investors not wanting to invest.

Uri Levine (00:24:14):
So two types of, abstractly, two types of crisis. One is that I would call that a cash crisis. So all of a sudden your cash program or plan is being jeopardized, for losing a customer, disappearing investor, not meeting your expectation, dramatic price change in the market and so forth. And the other one is lose of product market fit. So all of a sudden whatever you have is irrelevant anymore and you actually need to go back to square one.

(00:24:54):
For the first type of crisis, if this is a cash crisis, then what you really need to ask yourself, and in any type crisis, first of all is what is actually being impacted? Is that my run rate, is that my product, is that my revenue stream? If I'm still relevant?

(00:25:19):
With Order.chat, we were irrelevant, that's it. And so the first thing that you need to do is what is really being impacted? And then the second thing is how long it's going to last? Is that a temporary thing? Is that forever? Is that the new future? And then you ask yourself, okay, so how much run rate do I have? And you re-plan accordingly.

(00:25:52):
And I'll give you some examples, and this is really important, because let's say that you're a company that we have $5 million of revenues a year, say 400,000 per month, and your burn rate, your net burn rate is 200,000. So you actually at the end of the year, in order to run for a year, you need about two and a half million dollars to run. If you lose half of the revenues, and you only had two and a half million in the bank, you now have six month to run. So obviously you need to re-adapt.

(00:26:36):
Now, one of the things that you might say to yourself, "I'm going to remain on the same course and I'm going to deal with the crisis in five month from now." Or you can basically say, "No, I'm going to change my expense to adjust to the current revenue stream that I have and still have 12 month of run rate."

(00:26:58):
Whatever you are going to decide, you are going to decide, you need to decide today, right now. And the reason is very simple, if you want to reduce the burn, the expenses in order to extend the run rate, if you wait two more month, then it's going to become nearly impossible to do. If you wait six more month, then obviously this is impossible to do. So the longer that you wait, you actually lose options. The only ability to choose is today. This is one of the most challenging part of a crisis. You actually need to make a decision rapidly, like today.

(00:27:41):
There are few reasons to that. Number one is that if you don't then you might lose options. Number two, and this is about communicating within the organization that decision. Look, if there is a crisis everyone knows, everyone knows, and you don't do anything about it, this is not a good practice. Now you might want to decide, no, we're going to keep on running full steam ahead until we hit the wall because by that we increase the likelihood that we will have enough velocity to bypass the wall. But you need to communicate that with your team because the one that is really suffer is not just you, it's the entire team. They know that there is a crisis and they want to know that someone that holds the steering wheel is making the decisions. And if you don't, then guess what? You are then a sinking ship. And what's going to happen is that the top performing people, they would leave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:46):
Let me do a quick summary of what you've shared to give people a landscape and then let's keep going down this route. So there's basically two types of crisis. And there's small crisis, I imagine someone's pissed off at something. These are how you describe major crisis, like existential crisis for your startup. Is that the way to think about it?

Uri Levine (00:29:04):
Right. Because if an A-player leaves, I hate it, but it's not a crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:10):
Yeah. Okay, cool. So there's two, cash crisis, which is either a bunch of revenue disappears or investors bail or don't want to keep supporting you. Those are the two major buckets. And then there's product market fit crisis, could be a competitor launches, could be the market changes, things like that.

(00:29:28):
And within the cash crisis, so say you realize we don't have as much cash as we planned or need, the three steps you just described, what is really being impacted? Just be really real with what is the impact to our business with this change. How long do we think this cash crisis will last? And how long do we have before we run out of cash essentially?

Uri Levine (00:29:51):
Yep. And then you need to decide, and then you need to decide on your action and your new plan and maybe it's a new strategy. If all of a sudden I would say if this is about product market fit disappeared, then this is a new strategy. And maybe it's about deciding on extending the run rate or keep on trying or whatever. And this is something that is really interesting.

(00:30:17):
And we go back to Covid and I look at two of my startups that were in the travel space, one of them is WeSki, and it's essentially the booking.com of ski vacations. And guess what? Covid started. And there was no more ski trips to Europe. Europe were shut down completely. And all the ski areas were shut down. And you know that I'm an avid skier? For me that was a disaster on a personal level. And eventually by the way, what happened is that I was back in Tel Aviv and I was unable to travel to Europe, and it was only somewhere in 2022 that I was able to travel to the US after vaccination and so forth. And in March, 2022, I actually moved myself to Utah to Salt Lake City and I basically say, "No, I'm going to ski every day that I'm not busy." And I skied until the end of the season.

(00:31:22):
So what happened is that Covid started and we realized that we have major problem. And the problem was actually, the first thing that you face is cancellation because all of a sudden out of very few cancellations per day, you ended up with hundreds of cancellations per day because this is it. And after you dealt with that, then the next question that we ask ourselves, okay, so how bad is it, how long it's going to last?

(00:31:54):
Now that was supposed to be the first year that we were profitable. So we did not have a lot of cash in the bank because we expected to become profitable this year. And we basically told our ourself, okay, this season is over, next season is not going to happen. We don't know, but we need to plan for something that is going to last longer than that. And then we basically say, okay, how can we deal with it?

(00:32:21):
Now, because of WeSki had a lot of strategic investors from the travel industry, in the travel industry, they didn't really care about WeSki, they care about their own product. If you are a hotel chain, then guess what? You have no travelers. If you're an airline, guess what? You have no flyers. So anyone in the travel industry suffered from the same problem. And the last thing on earth that they care about is a startup that they invested at. And we realized that, okay, wait a minute, we don't have enough cash to survive for two seasons without revenues, we need to raise additional capital.

(00:33:00):
Now, no one, no new investor is going to speak with us, because there's no ski, so what are you talking about? And we approached the existing investor, and by the way I'm one of them, and we basically say, "Okay, you know what? We need your help." And everyone told us, "Oh, we are busy. We have other problems to deal with. We have our own problems. I don't see how is that going to become a good investment and so forth." And then we basically decided that, okay, wait a minute, we're going to do a pay to play.

(00:33:37):
The pay to play is actually sort of forcing new investors at the expense of the existing one. So for example, doing a major down round is sort of pay to play, because if you're not participate your position in the company is going to be diluted severely. And this is what we decided to do. And that was way more complex, I describe that in the book, way more complex than that because we also had safe instruments that we need to convert before we can actually do something like that. And that was really complex. But we ended up doing that. And today the company is actually very successful.

(00:34:20):
After Covid, we used the time of Covid to actually improve the product, and as soon as Covid was over then we started to grow rapidly. And the company is profitable, is growing rapidly, is actually providing very, very good service to its customers. To a certain extent I would say we ended up getting out of this crisis successfully.

(00:34:49):
But if you are in the middle of it and you ask yourself, so what are the chances that we will end up being successful? It looks way smaller. Way smaller. So what happened here is that you realize that, okay, this is not forever, so ski is going to come back but we don't know how long and therefore we assume that it's going to be for two seasons until it's coming back, until 2022. And for that we need to adapt. And so we resized the company to be very, very lean and small and we raise just enough capital to survive those two years. And it ended up to be working very well. But in that sense now, if you would ask me how much luck was in there, luck is always good.

(00:35:43):
I think that I heard ... maybe the most significant real estate developers in New York is Silverstein, and he built the World Trade Center and pretty much everything on the Hudson. And he was asked how he becomes such a successful developer and he said, "Tell you the truth, this is 85% luck and 15% skills and know-how and so forth." And then he was asked if he can change one thing, what exactly it's going to be, and he said, "You know what? I'm going to replace the 15% skills with additional 15% luck." So luck is good. For me luck, I will define luck as opportunity meets readiness. Readiness is up to you; opportunity, not always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):
Beautifully said. I also agree with luck being so core to most people's success, most company's success. But I feel like you're not giving people enough credit for the hard work that's also involved in the skills and timing and stuff.

Uri Levine (00:36:47):
On the readiness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:47):
That's the readiness.

Uri Levine (00:36:49):
Of being ready to take advantage of opportunity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
That makes sense. Okay, there's a bunch of stuff I want to dig into here. So one is, and this is something, it's kind of a tangent, but I think it's a core part of your advice on crisis, which is that it's always the founder's fault if things don't work out, even if they're completely out of your control, even if the whole world is changing, it's still your responsibility and your fault if things don't work out.

Uri Levine (00:37:18):
I wouldn't say fault, I would say responsibility.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):
Responsibility.

Uri Levine (00:37:25):
It might not end up beautiful, in some cases you will die. But at the end of the day you cannot rely on someone else. The fact that the interest rate is going up and the result is that it's becoming very, very hard to raise capital, the fact that this is industry-wide, so what? You have only one company, you need to make sure that this company is successful. And later on if you fail, then you can rely to then basically say, "This is my excuse, it was not just me." Not just me is not going to help you to become successful. Just me is going to help you to become successful. When you assume responsibility, then you are able to ... you're basically saying, "You know what? I control my own destiny. I'm going to make the decisions and I control my own destiny." When this happens, you increase the likelihood of being successful regardless what happen to the rest of the market, and you don't really care.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:31):
You also talk along these lines, you have this in your chapter, the section of never give up in a crisis and throughout your journey, this is by far the most important behavior of a startup CEO. Can you just talk about that. Because a lot of times it's like maybe just stop, maybe just give up. You shared one example where it's like I don't want to deal with regulation, other companies, I'm just going to stop. Any advice there, just like, okay, maybe it does make sense just to stop and try to give the investor's money back versus, yeah, it's just part of your job not to give up.

Uri Levine (00:38:58):
I heard of cases that you basically say our underlining assumptions didn't work out and our thesis is wrong and therefore we would like to return the investors their money. But entrepreneurs never give up. And this is the most successful behavior of startup CEO, never give up, always keep on looking for ways to make it work. And so it is going to be a journey of failures, and in particular during crisis, but you still need to keep on trying to make it work even though it's way harder. So never give up is the most important behavior of successful CEO of startup.

(00:39:41):
The second one, by the way, is making decisions with conviction. This is true for all CEOs or for all companies, not just startups. Now startups, those decisions are probably more frequent and there are a lot of them. But during crisis, all CEOs in the world need to make hard decisions. And you need to make them with conviction because if you don't make them with conviction, then what will happen is that the team is not going to follow. If the team is not going to follow, then you are not going to be successful.

(00:40:14):
But never give up. You ask entrepreneurs what will happen and they will basically tell you, "No, we keep on fighting." One of my other startups in the travel industry called Oversee, back then they called FairFly. And the CEO told me that a cat might have nine souls. We are a cat in that sense, we have nine souls. And the reason that I know that is that we already died nine times or almost died nine times. And so the reality is that you don't give up, you keep on as long as ...

(00:40:56):
And for a second I would say, look, there are only two reasons that you would like to give up. One is that your mission is wrong. So the problem disappears. And if the problem disappears, your mission is no longer relevant or no longer valid, and you might want to consider to give up.

(00:41:19):
The other one is that if the team is not right and you are unable to change it. So you brought toxic investors into the board and they started to control the company and obviously in many cases they create more damage than help. And you're unable to change that anymore, then this is a good reason to give up.

(00:41:43):
Other than that, never give up. Crisis, not crisis, hardship, no money to pay, no ... anything that might happen, anything that you might want to think that might happen will happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:06):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:08):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:23):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. And not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:57):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:16):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:43:30):
This idea of never give up, it's very similar to Dalton Caldwell was on the podcast, he's a partner at YC, and his whole ... he has a famous talk, I guess, at YC, and this was the title of this podcast episode, is just don't die. That's his main advice to a startup, just don't die.

Uri Levine (00:43:45):
Never give up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:45):
Never give up.

Uri Levine (00:43:46):
You might die by the way, you might die, you'll never give up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:50):
Then be reborn. And to be clear, the way a startup dies is they run out of money, is that the simplest way to think about that?

Uri Levine (00:43:57):
That's the only way that they die. By the way, all the companies in the world, they are unable to pay their bills and therefore they die.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:06):
And many of the tactics you share is just ways to not run out of money. Oftentimes it involves down rounds, creating strange cap structures just to keep it alive, losing equity percentage just to keep it going, that's part of the job basically, and that's what you have to deal with.

Uri Levine (00:44:24):
In many cases, we had to engage the employees, "No, we don't have cash." So what we did is that we diluted all shareholders in order to give employees way more equity. So five times more equity than they had before. And we told them, we need you to trust us and believe in the cause and believe in our ability to recover. And if we don't, then everyone loses. But if we do, then everyone wins big time. And so this will be a way to actually reengage employees if you are unable to pay them their regular pay. And that was the case in most of the startups that almost run out of cash.

(00:45:08):
Occasionally you can do, if you will tell me that you're going to run out of cash next month and therefore you need to shut down, I would like to imagine that you have at least six more month of run rate. You don't know that, but this is through leadership. So you basically tell your people, "Stay with me, you believed in the cause, you believed in my leadership, I still believe in the cause and I still believe in you. And maybe we are going to have some hard time, maybe we are going to have some month that unable to pay, but eventually we will get out of that." And in many cases, most people will stay.

(00:45:55):
Now, leadership, you don't build leadership during crisis, you might, but in particular you build leadership through transparency, through recognitions of your team, through actually putting your team as the top priority. At the end of the day, you are going to be successful if your team delivers. And in order for the team to deliver, then they need you to trust them to deliver.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):
This is really powerful advice and I want to spend a little more time here, which is keeping people on board and engaged and motivated through a crisis. So this kind of almost script you just shared is really great. Is there anything else that you found useful or any advice you could share for helping a founder keep the team on board, keep people excited, driven? These words you shared I think is a really good example, is there anything else?

Uri Levine (00:46:53):
So during crisis, people will appreciate more than anything else transparency. And if you hide information from them, then they would leave, they don't trust you anymore. But if there is a crisis, and look, if there is a crisis then everyone knows that there is a crisis, it's not surprising for anyone. And this is where they expect your leadership the most. This is where they expect you to be there for them. And tell them that this is what we're going to do. And if ABC happens, then we will be successful. And if it's not, then we will die. And I want you to believe that we can deliver A, B and C, and I want you to stay here for that part of the journey. And this is really, really dramatic, this is perhaps the most important part. Look, during crisis, the team is the one that is going to take you out of the crisis, and you need them more than ever. And guess what? They need you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):
When you talk about being transparent and open about everything, what's an example of just how far you recommend people go? Because you could just be like, here's all of our data and metrics and numbers, here's what our investors are emailing me. How real do you recommend people get? I know it's hard to just summarize in a couple sentences, but what's a good way to illustrate that?

Uri Levine (00:48:19):
So number one, don't sugarcoat. So you basically you don't need to share all the feedbacks from all the investors. You can tell them, "Look, I met dozens of investors in the last couple of weeks and they're all saying no." Or we had a signed term sheet and the investor disappeared. Okay, that's fine. It is what it is. Look, the fact that it's ugly, if you don't tell that it's ugly, it's still ugly.

(00:48:49):
And so I would share the essence. And if we have metrics, then what I would like to do is believe that everyone is aware of the metrics, of the key metrics of the company. This is something that in general I would say, "Oh, in the lobby of the office, we should have the key metrics displayed for everyone to understand this is what we stand for, this is how well we are executing anyhow." And so when they will see the numbers drop, they know that the numbers drop. And this is something that I will in general I would say, look, key metrics, they should be shared anyhow. And so in particular during crisis, we should keep on sharing them. Definitely not hiding information. So if you have a major customer leave or investor disappear or we are unable to sign a term sheet. And so this is the highlight, this is the major issue. And the details themselves, it's less critical. Now if people ask, then answer. If someone ask, "Okay, so how many investors have you met?" I'd say no, then start counting, 37, be specific.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:11):
That's a great answer. I want to come back to something you said that I think is so important but so hard, which is to act fast. If I was a founder, something changes in the market, it's easy to say, "Okay, you need to cut burn, you need go raise money, down round." It's so hard to do, to lay people off, to do all these challenging things for your company. Can you again just help people understand why it's so important to act fast? You talked about optionality goes away. Just like what actually happens there if you don't?

Uri Levine (00:50:42):
So I'll give you an example. So let's say that you are almost run out of cash and you believe that you're going to raise capital in the next two month. And if not, then you run out of cash. One of the things that you might want to do is extend the run rate. One other thing that you might want to do is actually tell the people that we will be running out of cash in two month. And number one, I want you to help me even if we run out of cash because there are good chances that we eventually will be able to raise capital and recover that. And number two, in order to get your support and belief in the company I am going to offer you more equity. So, the more equity is something that I will do twice, once today, once you realize that this is going to be challenging, and then again if we need to ask people to reduce their salary or do something dramatic around that.

(00:51:59):
And the first one is actually preventive action. So you share the know-how, you share the challenges that we are going to face. And you demonstrate generosity not out of you have to, but you demonstrate that. And then you essentially dramatically increase their loyalty and their commitment. And when you will need them, they will be there. So this is one example.

(00:52:35):
The other example is about calculating end of cash. And this is really, really important. So let's say that you have run rate of X month, six month. If you reduce burn by 50% today, then you simply increase your run rate to a year. If you don't do it today and you wait three more month, then you only can do that for the ... so the first three month you burn the same way that you did up until now, and now you reduce that to half, so you have six more month, total of nine month. If you decided today that you need 12 month, and you don't act today, you will never have 12 month.

(00:53:32):
Now, is that the only way to do that? No, it's not the only way, but it's one of the ways that by the way most companies will do. So they will reduce burn rate today in order to extend the run rate. Is that going to be more helpful? Don't know. Really depending on the case.

(00:53:53):
If you had asked me if you reduce the burn rate, increase the run rate, so now you have 12 month to raise new capital, is that going to have higher likelihood of remaining with the current plan and growth and raise capital within six month? I don't know that. But this is exactly the decision that you need to make.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:17):
That's a really great way of putting it. Just the math means the leverage you have now to extend runway is so much higher the sooner you make the decision. And the key, just going back to your algorithm of deciding if we need to act in this way quickly, is first think about what's being impacted, then how long is this impact going to last, and then how long do I have before you run out of money. And those questions is your advice for deciding, do we let people go now, do we raise money now.

Uri Levine (00:54:51):
There is always, by the way, there is always alternative for let people go. In general, I would say letting people go is probably better than reducing salary for everyone. But let's say that you need cost reduction of 30%. One of the options is let 30% of the people go. Another option is actually reduce salary by 30% for everyone. And it's going to have the same impact. Not exactly, the same impact on the balance sheet and on the P&L, but not necessarily on the organization. If the organization feels that they are committed to each other, they will prefer the second way. If this is more of individuals, then obviously they will prefer the first way.

(00:55:45):
Is there a different way? What about if management gives up on their salary? That might make the same impact. And definitely demonstration of leadership. And by the way, increasing the commitment of the rest of the organization.

(00:56:06):
So in that sense, I would say there are multiple ways of reducing the cost. But in general, this is always about impacting people. If you look at the startup and you look at the budget, 70% of the budget is people, maybe 75% of the budget is people. Everything else is nickels and dimes. If you're going to tell me, "Oh no, we are going to start the supply of coffee to the office and this is how we are going to reduce cost." No, this is how you create dissatisfaction with the team and you would reduce costs because some people would leave because of that, not because of lack of coffee, but because of inability to determine and to make hard decisions. So end of the day, if you need to reduce costs that means people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:58):
That was really good advice and really good set of options to consider versus laying people off. So most of what we've been talking about right now has been the cash crisis route. We've spent a little time on the product market fit crisis route. But I want to spend a little more time there. So for the cash crisis route, you have these kind of three questions and then it's like, cool, this will tell you how quickly to act and how severely to make cuts. In the product market fit route, is it essentially if you've lost product market fit, it's to pivot, is that basically the question? And then it's a question of where to pivot and what to do?

Uri Levine (00:57:32):
So the first question is, am I still relevant? And probably the answer is no. And then the next question that you basically say, "Okay, do I want to pivot?" And for that I will say, "If I would start today, is this is what I'm going to do?" And if the answer is yes, then do it.

(00:57:54):
Now in many cases you say, "Oh, wait a minute, I already have the organization and I already have money in the bank and this is what I'm going to do instead." I wouldn't necessarily do that. The way that I would look at it is different. Because the other alternative is basically say, "Wait a minute, all of my underlining assumptions have gone, they are wrong." I lost product market fit. The value proposition that I had is wrong or is no longer valid or no longer relevant. And therefore I need to start from scratch. Do I really have the assets to become successful on the new path?

(00:58:44):
And the assets could be technology that you already developed, could be the team that you already built, could be the know-how that you have in that specific market that gives you a significant advantage. And if any of those is really, really significant, then it's possible that you want to pivot. Pivot basically say major fuck up, all of our underlining assumptions have gone.

(00:59:13):
And because everything else, if it's not, then that's part of the journey of failure. If you'll tell me, "Oh, we tried this product or we tried this feature and didn't work," then this journey of fail. This is going to be your journey.

(00:59:27):
But once you figure out product market fit, if it disappears, then pivot is one option, shutting down is another option. And for shutting down, there are two things that you need to ask yourself. Do I have the energy to keep on going? Maybe you basically say, "I spent the last seven years trying to do that and now it's gone and you know what? I need some time off."

(00:59:53):
And the other one is that do I really have the assets to become dramatically successful? Pontera is one of my startups that I started back in 2012. And back then we called that FeeX. And we were dealing with financial fees in Israel and we were actually pretty successful. And then we decided, okay, wait a minute, Israel is a small market, let's move to the US. And we moved to the US. And one day the CEO came to me and said, "Look, we need to focus, I cannot do both, so we need to pivot." And we stopped the Israeli operation completely in order to focus all of our effort on the US operation. And then we realized that the nature of the beast is different and therefore we need to re-look for product market fit. And eventually we found that with the regulations of the Obama administration, and that was our product back in 2016 or 17.

(01:00:59):
And then the administration have changed and now it's going to change again. And they changed the regulation. And overnight we figured out that ... And we were actually on being a successful path. And we had to reinvent ourself. Now, what we basically said is, "Look, we have the energy to keep on going, we have something, a thesis that we believe might be relevant for us. We have the technology that can serve the thesis and we have enough cash to try it out." And we went back to the board and we offered them two options. Number one, we give you your money back. And number two, this is what we're going to try.

(01:01:43):
And the interesting part is that investors don't want their money back. They did not invest in order to have their money back, they invest in order to make a significant impact. And obviously they don't want to go back to their investors and tell them, guess what? And so we had all the support to keep trying something else. And since 2018, we are actually being pretty successful on this path. And all of a sudden, company is 12 years old, and we pivoted twice. And now we are end of the day helping Americans to retire richer. Helping financial advisors to support you on your 401k plans, on retirement saving plans. And the result is pretty significant. So this company is on a path of being successful, but we almost died twice.

(01:02:44):
And look, all the CEOs in the world, if you would ask them, have you nearly died already? And they will tell you yes. And then the next question would be how many times? And they will tell you multiple times. And if they're not, that means that they're simply too early on their journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
That's such an important point. It came up, I just had Toby from Shopify on the podcast, and he said exactly the same thing. That just like the number of times Shopify almost died, people have no idea. It's important to know, that's very common.

Uri Levine (01:03:17):
Yeah. And I'm a good friend with Harley Finkelstein, the president of Shopify, and he told ... we exchanged horror stories about nearly dying. And we are still here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:30):
Just never give up. To double down on this pivot point real quick. So the things you should look at to help you decide if a pivot is a good idea, you shared, you have some tech that might be helpful in this new direction, you have a team that's really well suited to this new idea or you have some knowledge. Is there anything else, just like what's that list of things you should look at to see, to come up with ideas/decide this is a good idea for us to pursue?

Uri Levine (01:03:57):
So going back to basic, but now you are already running, so you probably have already validated the problem or the value proposition. About pivoting, so when you start you think that, okay, I have this brilliant idea. And what I really encourage people is first of all, go and validate the problem, speak with people, understand their perception of the problem. And only then start to think about the solution. Now, this is still not the case in most startups. And this is fall in love with the problem, not the solution. And for a few reasons, and maybe number one reason is, look, entrepreneurship journey is about creating value. Simplest way to create value, seel a product, that's it, simplest way. And I like simple.

(01:04:50):
But then in addition, when you focus on the problem, then the problem is going to serve as the north star of your journey. And when you have a north star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and increase the likelihood of being successful. But by and large, your story is going to be way more compelling. If we will be here in 2007, and I will tell you that I'm going to build an AI crowdsourced based navigation system, you're going to say, "Oh yeah, very interesting," But you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care. When your customer care, they want you to be successful. And when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.

(01:05:31):
And so this is going back into pivoting the same way, first of all, validate what's your value proposition, what's the problem you're going to solve. Now, in most cases you already validated that because you in the market for some years and you had dialogues with customers and you already realized that. And maybe you already told yourself, you know what? In my next startup this is what I'm going to do. And so it's possible that you already validated. And if you haven't, then this is exactly the time to revalidate the value proposition. So this is the first thing that you need to do.

(01:06:06):
And then the second thing that you want to do is ask yourself, do I really have a significant advantage here? Do I really have the team, the technology, the know-how to make a leap from here and really lead the market?

(01:06:22):
And then the other part of it is, okay, do I have the energy and the passion to go and do it all over again? Because this is going back to square one, trying to figure out product market fit and then figuring out business model and then figuring out growth and so forth. So the entire journey from scratch. And if you answer yes to all of those, so you have the very significant value proposition and you think that you have something that is going to accelerate you dramatically because of the know-how, the technology, the team, then the next thing that you're going to do is validate it with the team.

(01:07:05):
In your underlining assumptions the team is going to continue. Maybe, maybe not. This is exactly the time that you would like to validate that. And the way that you're going to validate that is you basically say to them, "Guess what? We are fucked. Our underlining assumptions are no longer valid. And this is our new opportunity and we can go this path or we can die." And let's see what people, if they believe in the new path, then this is a good idea.

(01:07:36):
In many cases, by the way, it's possible that the new path will come from them. They're the one that are closer to the customers, they're the one that are closer to the technology. They're the one that are probably know better than you if this new path is actually valid or not. And if this is the case, then you go and do it.

(01:07:56):
The last one that you want to ... Look, even if you don't have the money for it, let's say that you don't have plenty of cash in the bank, go back to the investors and go back to raise capital because now you actually have a very significant advantage. You already have a technology, you already have a team, you already have the know-how, you are already second time entrepreneur because pivot is like restarting from scratch or you are already multiple times entrepreneur, so you are way more attractive today than when you were a few years back. And so go back to existing investors and new investors and raise more capital for this new journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):
I like this algorithm. I was writing it down as you're talking. So basically when you're deciding to pivot, looking for opportunities to pivot, step one is find a problem, validate there's a problem that exists. Step two is figure out if you have the tech, team or know-how that gives you an advantage to win at solving this problem. Then ask yourself, do you have the passion and energy to be spending your life and the many number of years attacking this problem? Then validate your team, wants to also go after this problem. And then check with your investors and try to get money to fund you going after this problem.

Uri Levine (01:09:16):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
Awesome.

Uri Levine (01:09:17):
And I like this order now. Some people will tell you, "Oh, my order is different." And I'm not saying if this is the right thing or the wrong thing, but I think that ... One of the reason that I say this is the order is, look, when you validate the problem and the value proposition, even if you don't have the passion, if it's been validated, your passion will be built up. Because then you speak with potential customers and you tell them, "This is what I'm thinking of doing and this is how it's going to help you." They will say, "Yes, I need that. Can you do it tomorrow?" Then all of a sudden you get excited about it.

(01:10:05):
And usually when I speak about consumers then I tell people, look, when you go and speak about the problem, if the answer that you are going to get is, "Oh, I know someone that had this problem," don't follow this path. If they will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no, this is not the problem, the problem is," and they will give you their version of the problem, this is where you want to follow that. To a certain point, if you speak with enough people, you would have the sense that you are being sent on a mission. And this is where your passion is going to go through the roof. And so don't start with the passion, let the passion be built.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):
I totally feel that. I have friends who started this company Zip, which is a procurement, a really good procurement platform. And I don't know if they were growing up wanting to be building a business that helps procurement experiences be better. And they pivoted six times before they picked this idea. But through that, I think found how big of a deal this was and how much happier people can be in their day to day with a better product and got excited about it. And now that's what they're building.

Uri Levine (01:11:14):
The best thing happen when you try to validate a problem is that you speak with someone and they will tell you in a very strong emotional word, "I hate that," or something like that. Yeah, this is exactly what you're looking for, you're looking for something that people will engage emotionally and with strong emotions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:34):
Someone once described it as you want to look for their pupils to dilate when you tell them, when you talk about this problem.

Uri Levine (01:11:39):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:40):
There was a quote I wrote down as you were talking earlier that I think is really great. It's kind of a framework for ... the way you used it is to help you pick which direction to go. But I think it's a useful framework in general for companies and founders is ask yourself, if I were to start today, what would I have done and what would I do if I were to start this company again today? I think that's such a powerful thing to always think about even when everything's going great.

Uri Levine (01:12:03):
I agree. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. And this is pretty much everything in your life. So ask yourself, knowing what I know today, would I do something different? Now, if the answer is yes, then do something different today. Don't wait until next life or next company or next relationship or next something. If you basically know today that you should be doing something different, then change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:33):
I think that's extra important because somebody will do that probably and compete with you and put you out of business, and it's better that you do that first.

Uri Levine (01:12:42):
But this is true for everything in your life. Look, if you are working in a place and you are not happy and you suffer there, then I would say ... The guidance that I give to my children is very simple. If you're not happy at your working place, then ask yourself, is there something that I can do to change that? Then try to change that for the next three month. If you're unable to change that, then leave. You don't deserve to be unhappy. And you need to control your own destiny. For me, quitting your job, do you know what it means? You fire your own job boss, that's what it means. You fire your boss by quitting, that's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
That's empowering, I like that. Okay, just, okay, two more questions. One is I want to close the loop on the Waze story. So you talked about how Google launched, a competitor basically, free turn-by-turn directions, that was the business you were building and you essentially had to change direction. What did you actually do, how did you decide and realize this?

Uri Levine (01:13:57):
We didn't change. Back in 2010, we were simply not good enough, we were still in the product market fit iterations and iterations and iterations, and we were not good enough. And we kept on building and we kept on iterating and iterating and iterating. But we almost ran out of cash. And then we had this lucky day that Microsoft decided to invest, and so did Qualcomm. The funny part is that I had this dialogue with Qualcomm Ventures and they told me that they're not sure why is that important for them. And I read someplace that they did not invest at Twitter at $55 million. And this is exactly what I told them, "May I remind you that you did not invest in Twitter at $55 million valuation. This is where Waze is today." And obviously different story, but that was the fear of missing out, the FOMO was [inaudible 01:14:58]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Yeah, I was going to say, good FOMO.

Uri Levine (01:15:00):
But the result was that we had enough cash to keep on trying and keep on iterating and iterating and iterating. And eventually we ended up to be very successful. So that was not about pivoting or changing directions or doing anything dramatic. We basically say, okay, we will need to reduce costs dramatically. We decided that we are not ... By the way, what we did is we reduced the salary of the management only. And to a certain extent I would say people didn't even know. We decided in the management meeting that this is what we're going to do. And if push come to shovel, then we will do the next step and the next step and the next step. But we were eventually able to raise capital. So in that sense, the nearly die was a matter of state of mind, but we did not run out of cash, we raised capital just before that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:01):
The story is actually really illustrative of a point I was thinking as you were talking, which is that product market fit crisis often also leads to a cash crisis from investors not wanting to invest.

Uri Levine (01:16:12):
In many cases, yes, in many cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:14):
You get a double whammy.

Uri Levine (01:16:18):
But to a certain extent I would say no. Product market fit basically means that you go back to square one. The other alternative that you have, and by the way it's also valid, is if you are unable to convince your existing investors to reinvest in the company in order to build the new part of the journey, the new journey, then you know what? Shut down the company and restart a new company that is doing exactly that. And that's a bigger threat for investors because they are not part of the new journey. Now, they might want to say, "Oh, the company owns the IP." The know-how is the people, owned by the people, not the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
How do you avoid the crisis? A lot this advice is here, you have a crisis, here's how to deal with it. Any advice for how to avoid falling into a crisis as a founder?

Uri Levine (01:17:17):
Number one answer is no. Don't worry, you will face crisis. And if you worry, you're still going to face crisis. Number two is that, look, it's way easier to deal with a crisis if you have plenty of cash in the bank. So if you can raise capital and maintain higher level of cash in the bank, it will help you to go through the next crisis, but it's not going to avoid it. So always be funded is a good advice. But in general, look, you do not prepare for the next crisis because you don't know what kind of crisis it's going to be next. And you can assume that there will be the next crisis. Trust me, there will be the next crisis. And then the most important part is that you analyze that fast and then you act fast. But you cannot prepare for it because you don't know where it's going to come from. And this is really, really important. The best preparation is that if you have plenty of cash. In general I would say if you have plenty of cash, then this is going to help you for many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:36):
When you say plenty of cash, do you have any advice, kind of common advice of have 18 months of runway, is there anything there you'd recommend for founders?

Uri Levine (01:18:44):
And this is really depending on the CEOs and their risk attitude. Some of my CEOs prefer to have two to three years of run rate. They basically say, "This is my comfort zone. I know that I can restart if I need to. I know that I can suffer major crisis. I know that I can go into new direction if I want to. I know that I can expand and try something completely different if I want to." And this is not necessarily as a result of a crisis. So maybe you basically say here is an opportunity and I have the cash to do that.

(01:19:22):
My general rule will be around 18 month. Are you okay with 12 month? Yeah, if you risk taker, bigger risk taker then you can survive with 12 month. But the challenge is that, look, if you have shorter period of time, then you don't have enough time to execute, you need to focus on fundraising all the time. And you want to focus on creating value and not just bringing cash into the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:53):
Yeah. Obviously the downside of raising more runway is you're giving away more of your company, but it's always this trade off, how much to sell, how money to get. Being a founder, what a tough gig. And I'm going to come back to this quote you had that I shared at the beginning of the podcast, which is building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next.

Uri Levine (01:20:13):
Yeah. It goes back into how ... the other three dimensions of a startup, it's a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs, and it's a journey of failures because we are trying to build something new that no one did before so we tried multiple things. For that, Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed that because you haven't tried new things before. And it's a long journey, it's a very long journey. In particular, the longest part is until you figure out product market fit. And now I add the fourth dimension of that, that this is a journey from one crisis to the next one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):
How many companies have you started, 10 last time I saw?

Uri Levine (01:20:54):
Yeah, about, a little bit more than that, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:57):
A little bit more than that.

Uri Levine (01:21:02):
Not all of them are going to be successful, but most of them are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:07):
In some form. And you just keep doing it. You're a glutton for crisis is what I'm hearing here.

Uri Levine (01:21:15):
I'm not here for the crisis, I'm there for the value creation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share that you think might be helpful to get into before we wrap up?

Uri Levine (01:21:31):
I really like this podcast, I really like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
Me too.

Uri Levine (01:21:36):
And hopefully, in my mind, this is my mindset of a teacher, my destiny is about value creation, and if this podcast or this book, this one, can help people to become more successful, then I fulfill my destiny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:58):
Uri, I'm so delighted to be helping you fulfill your destiny. Two final questions. Where can folks find the book? When is it for sale? And then just how can listeners be useful to you?

Uri Levine (01:22:08):
The book is going to be published in about a month from now. And it is already available for pre-orders on Amazon, but later on it will be on bookstores throughout the US and Canada and so forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
What's the date it'll be published because we're recording this ... Maybe it's coming out around the time we publish this. So what's the date?

Uri Levine (01:22:26):
I think it's February 15th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:29):
Okay, great. I think this is coming out right around there, so perfect timing.

Uri Levine (01:22:32):
So perfect timing. And you can follow me on LinkedIn or you can go to my website, urilevine.com. And I want you to read the book. End of the day, you asked me at the beginning what do I want to accomplish? Do I want people to buy the book or read the book? And I told you, "Look, everything that I'm trying to do in my life is about doing good and doing well." So buying the book is the doing well part of it and reading the book is the doing good part of it. And I want you to read the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:10):
That's so good. Uri, thank you so much for being here.

Uri Levine (01:23:15):
Thank you, appreciate it.

# An inside look at Mixpanel’s product journey | Vijay Iyengar

## Transcript

Vijay Iyengar (00:00):
The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself right for disruption in your core because someone else can out invests you in that core. And so if you are the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invests everyone else in that core and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
Lenny (00:40):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Vijay Iyengar. Vijay is currently head of product at Mixpanel. He actually has a very similar career trajectory to myself where he started as an eng intern at Amazon. Then he was an engineer for a while at Uber, then he became an eng manager at Mixpanel. But then he shifted from an ENG manager to director of product, and now head of product at Mixpanel. You don't often see people moving from an leadership role straight to director of product, so it was really interesting to hear what he took from his eng experience and brought into his approach to product leadership. But we spent the bulk of our time talking about what he's learned from the journey that Mixpanel has been on, where they started with a simple product, then scaled to a number of different products, solving many problems for customers, and then made the hard decision to scale back to just a single core focused analytics product.
(01:33):
We talk about why they made that choice, what they learned about when it makes sense to expand a new product and when you probably shouldn't, and how they approach that organizationally. We also talk about how Mixpanel builds product, how they think about products philosophy, how they prioritize, and also what you're probably doing wrong in how you set up your analytics for your own product. With that, I bring you Vijay Iyengar after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming subjective bias, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers.

Vijay Iyengar (03:52):
Thank you, Lenny. Great to be here. Huge fan of the pod, and so glad I can contribute.
Lenny (03:57):
I definitely want to talk about Mixpanel's journey both as a product team and a product. But before we get there, as an engineer, you were in a longtime engineer and then you became a product leader, is there anything you had to unlearn as an engineer in the way you thought about leadership and product and business?
Vijay Iyengar (04:13):
One of the things after you've been in engineering for a while is that develop this tendency to immediately respond with no to new ideas. And I think from the engineering perspective, this is because you spend a lot of your time building and maintaining ideas that maybe are half thought out or didn't really go anywhere, and you just feel like the full brunt of the maintenance cost of that. And so you build up the scar tissue and this immune response to say no to new ideas, and it's a hard no, like no, we're definitely not going to do it. And I think I had to unlearn that moving into product because you get a lot of ideas coming from a lot more places in the organization, and ideas are fragile in their agency and it's a hard no can really kill a whole direction that you could potentially go.
(04:55):
They could be very high reach and high impact. So, one thing that I've found is the best way to get to a no, if you ultimately need to get there, is to try to make it work. Start trying to make yes work and document how you've tried to make yes work. And do that earnestly, not as an exercise of just an alternative that you're considering. Try to do it sincerely and get to know after trying to make yes work. And so that's one thing I've been trying to just apply my engineer problem solving brain to do that instead of thinking about how it might not work and saying no.
Lenny (05:25):
Is that something that you recommend engineers work on looking back? I know as a PM, it's like, oh, I love when engineers say yes. This is awesome. I'm going to actually help everyone learn to say yes. But as an engineer, obviously that's a challenge often. What do you recommend to folks that are engineers currently that maybe want to improve on this or shift in how they think about saying yes, saying no when they're asked about something new?
Vijay Iyengar (05:48):
I think some of the best engineers that I've worked with actually already do this, but [inaudible 00:05:53] they're able to balance both in their head. So, ultimately this balancing act, you just want on-call, you were woken up three times at 3:00 AM due to various bad ideas, and the next morning you wake up and then stand up, it's like, "Hey, can we do this new thing?" You kind of have to have that empathy and do that. So yeah, I think the exercise is just take 10 minutes to consider the idea and just sincerely consider how might we make it work. And if at the end of those 10 minutes, it's like futile and there's no path, it's fine to say no. And it's a good instinct to say no, actually in a lot of cases. But yeah, I would recommend that to engineers. I think it would've been better in my career, for sure, if I had learned that sooner.
Lenny (06:26):
I want to spend some time on the Mixpanel product journey. It's been an interesting rollercoaster. I think the company's been around for how many years? Since 2010? 2009?
Vijay Iyengar (06:34):
20009, yeah.
Lenny (06:35):
So, I know it started as kind of a very simple product analytics product back in the day. And then as you do with ambitious companies, you look for more problems to solve. You look for more problems to solve from your customers. So as I understand it, you guys added a lot more products to the suite of Mixpanel products. And then I know that there are some challenges with scaling that, and maybe the products didn't stick as much as you're hoping. And what I understand is recently, you moved back to just the single core analytics product. And so I'd love to just hear that journey of what that process was like, what you learned as a product leader and as a company about scaling, expanding, trying to solve a lot of problems, and then coming back to one core straightforward problem.
Vijay Iyengar (07:15):
Mixpanel started in 2009 as provide product analytics to EPD teams. And I think early on, it saw a lot of success because it built this in-house database called Arb, which stands for arbitrary segmentation. And that was necessary because events data, which is the fuel for product analytics, is few orders of magnitude larger than most other types of data that people collect, and so you need a specialized approach to deal with it. And so that I think spurred the first wave of explosive growth, because product analytics was a really burning problem at the time. People were shipping mobile apps like crazy and they needed a solution that could scale, and that was kind of a durable mode for Mixpanel for a while. And I think because we had this SDK that was installed in so many apps and we had this really scalable event collection and analytic interface, it was just natural to expand into a few adjacencies that would leverage those same technologies.
(08:04):
So, the first one was messaging, being able to send targeted messages to users, which is something that's fairly natural, you might want to do, especially if you have an SDK already installed. Yeah. The other aspect that we've added into was data infrastructure and trying to be the single source of truth of data in companies. And what ended up happening was that by 2018, we had this big churn problem. We had something like 40% churn, revenue churn, our core product. And when we dug into, it wasn't that people were churning because they didn't need product analytics anymore. They had the need. They were just churning to competition because we were just not up to the market in terms of the features we had in our core. And when we dug into why that was, it was just that we had a 50% engineering team that was building products across three domains, product analytics, messaging, and data engineering stuff.
(08:52):
Our engineering team was just spread too thin to address all of those core gaps in functionality. And so we made a really hard call at the time. We said the hard no to those two other categories and decided to focus our entire engineering team on closing the gap on product analytics and innovating there. And from a process standpoint, how we operationalize this was we threw away all our planning and all the execution and that we work that we'd planned to do so far, and we did something very simple. We took all the churn reasons that our customer success and sales teams had been painstakingly collecting for years, grouped them by category, which was roughly product features we needed to build, sorted descending by ARR, took the top 10 things and made that our roadmap, just give every engineer direct access to customers and give them a bucket to go work on, which I think goes against about a million product best practices out there of just doing that.
(09:41):
But I think given the context at the time, we needed to optimize for speed, and speed comes when you have extreme clarity on what you want to do and focus. And so we really just optimize for speed in that time. And so in that first year we moved really quickly and we shipped something like a hundred features in that year and closed a lot of gaps. Again, these are all vanity metrics. Measuring number of features doesn't mean anything.
Lenny (10:04):
And what year was this by the way?
Vijay Iyengar (10:06):
This is 2018 to 2019.
Lenny (10:09):
Got it.
Vijay Iyengar (10:09):
Yeah. So, we moved really fast shipping all these features and instantly saw the improvements to win rate and to retention. But one of the cracks that started to emerge was we neglected the holistic design of our product at the time, right? And if you're shipping features that quick leads, you don't have time to stop and think, where does this go, and how does this fit into our overall system architecture? And what started to happen was that we were hitting diminishing returns with some of these features. And not considering the holistic design and consistency meant the reach of every feature was low. You had to rebuild it for every part of the product that we were in. And so at the time we made... We spun up the second stream that was very design led. And I think this was also coincided around the time we adopted Figma, and it's a really broad design at seat at the table of the company, and we just set up this goal to make design one of our key differentiators.
(10:53):
So, this design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step? And then how will users discover them and how do they relate to each other? But I think this realization was born out of the fact that so many great products win or lose based on their architecture. I think Notion, for example, that pages in blocks architecture is so strong, and you can hang so many features off of those core building blocks in a way that has such high impact on region and discovery of those features.
(11:26):
So anyway, we did that in parallel with the.... And continued that grind on core jabs. And so the end result of that phase, which is from 2018 to maybe late 2021, 2022, was our retention went from about 60% to 90%, and our NPS went from 16 to 50. So I think, yeah, there's a lot in there to unpack, but refocusing on the core really helped us achieve those results.
Lenny (11:52):
Got it. Yeah. I have a lot of questions about this. So interesting. So, that phase that you went through where you sorted things by potential ARR, was that the phase of expanding to multiple products or that was post we're going to focus on analytics and go all in there?
Vijay Iyengar (12:06):
Oh, that was post focusing on analytics.
Lenny (12:08):
Okay.
Vijay Iyengar (12:08):
Yeah. Yeah.
Lenny (12:09):
And you're saying that you had a stream of just builds all the features that were lacking that are causing customers to churn, and in parallel, there was a track of let's build this product, such that it all connects and works together well and it's really well thought through long term?
Vijay Iyengar (12:24):
The first thing, I might have made it seem like it was just the buckets were features. We did take the step of turning them into problems and being clear, exposing engineers directly to the customers that had those problems and then invent a solution to solve them. So I mean, loosely there were features involved, but a lot of them were kind of core problems we needed to solve.
Lenny (12:40):
That first approach is so interesting. It's kind of like, yes, we will make more money if we focus on these features. To your point, it ends up being just a bunch of features and products that kind of maybe don't synergize. Looking back, was that a good idea to approach it that way, at least for a while?
Vijay Iyengar (12:54):
It highly depends on your context. In a very competitive context where there are just table stakes features that customers need and that it's been validated by the market, you need to optimize for speed more so than anything else. But it is an approach that outlives it's usefulness pretty fast, and we've put that approach behind us relatively quickly after that phase. And I would actually say that design driven phase was the next phase, where it was, okay, we're not bleeding on the table stakes anymore, but we want to make a holistic product that has high reach, high impact on the features and is actually usable. And so that was I think a follow-on phase that's necessary. Obviously, depending on your particular circumstances and competitive dynamics, you can sequence them differently, but I think it was the right call to just... Sort of the on-call thing again where when you're in trouble, you got to get out of trouble. You can't mow your lawn while your house is on fire. You kind of put out the fire and then deal with everything else.
Lenny (13:47):
Yeah.
Vijay Iyengar (13:47):
So, that's kind of the approach we took.
Lenny (13:49):
What's an example of a feature or product that you launched within that first track? And then what's an example of something that came out of the designer led approach, if anything comes to mind?
Vijay Iyengar (14:00):
I think out of the first track, oh man, there's so many that were just core. We didn't have a good cohorts product at the time, just being able to create behavioral cohorts users and create them from any report that we built, right? And I think that, I mean it's just table stakes and analytics to be able to do that. So, that was one of the first things we built, and it was fairly obvious. There's a lot of other things in more advanced types of funnel analytics and a flows and visualization that was really interactive. I think on the design-led phase, the biggest thing I think was visualization consistency and making our charts interactive in a consistent way across our entire product. And so there's two things that enabled. One was that every time we added a new visualization or a new enhancement to a visualization or how something is sorted in one report, it just instantly applied everywhere.
(14:46):
So, just the reach was multiplied for everything we added. And the other thing is it just made the product more accessible, let us add dark mode. So, it made our visualizations really stunning and really easy to see what the takeaways were. And then every new visualization we added inherited all those benefits.
Lenny (14:59):
I'm trying to think about being at a company that goes through this phase of, "Hey, we're just going to build a bunch of stuff that we know we need." And it feels like hearing it, it's like, "Oh yeah, and then we're just going to make it all look great and connect and work well." I imagine that wasn't planned, and I imagine that wasn't easy to get people to maybe slow down on just building more products and features or push it in a direction where it's all going to make sense. Can you talk at all about what that process was, how hard it was to shift from we're just going to knock through all this checklist of things to let's just bigger, let's slow down, let's spend a lot of time designing?
Vijay Iyengar (15:35):
It was definitely more messy internally than I described it. One of the key junctures was when we had this really talented design team and we were putting them on these very tactical projects that was, frankly, that was very engineering led, right? And design would often come in at the end and be asked like, "Hey, can you just make this look nice and put some pixels on it?" And it's just such a waste of your design team to have them do that. But at the same time, the pace was so high that they didn't have time to come up for air and do anything else. And so there's actually this moment where I was an engineering manager at part of this.
(16:05):
And had a meeting with our BM and our head of design at the time, and we said, "Hey, we can actually do the next three months of projects about any design," which was a kind of controversial thing to say, "but we're doing this so that you can take three months with a set of designers and go think about the system architecture of the product, and we'll wait for that to be done before we do any architectural things that might impact the architecture." And I think that gave designers a bit of breathing room to go do that, just separating them for a bit from the tactical fire. Because what was happening instead was we would get towards the end of the project, bring design in, and they would use each project as an opportunity to squeeze in like, oh, and we can simplify here. And that's just a classic way to blow up scope at the end of the project because there wasn't a dedicated space for design led projects.
(16:48):
And I think that that was kind of a key friction point that we ultimately had to decouple for a bit, and then regroup and say, "Okay, now we'll look what's our strategy," and just take on projects purely for the sake of improving consistency, reach depth of our UX.
Lenny (17:02):
Also, looking back, the process you went through adding a bunch of products to solve more customer problems, something every founder and product team thinks about, when should we add new product lines? When should we expand beyond the core? I'm curious what you take away as a lesson and what you'd advise other founders and companies when it comes to when is the time to expand and think about a new product and a third product and a fourth product?
Vijay Iyengar (17:28):
I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule here. I can just maybe say what made sense and didn't make sense in our context. The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself ripe for disruption in your core because someone else can out invest you in that core. And so if you, you're the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invest everyone else in that core, and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
(18:10):
And the other aspect of that is that those secondary products we took on were in categories of their own. And it's really tempting and you'll often get dragged into accidentally entering another category, and then you'll end up building these bolt-on products that are the best in their category, right? And the adjacent categories for analytics are CDPs or message targeting or feature flagging or something, but there's not that many people that need the sixth best CDP or the eighth best feature flagging or the 10th best message targeting tool. And it ends up being, in aggregate will contribute five to 10% to your revenue, won't seriously accelerate your growth rate, and then takes engineers away from the core product. And so those were the circumstances that we were.
(18:50):
And I think if you're seeing churn to your competitor on your core product and you're not best in class on any of the other ones, then maybe it's time to reevaluate. And then the last thing I'll say there is that it's also 10x more painful than you think to cut mild successes than anything else, and just organizationally painful. And there's teams that have whole roadmaps, and it's a really painful experience, so you have to think really hard before you kick those off.
Lenny (19:18):
That is really, really insightful advice, makes me think about if you bundle good enough solutions, there needs to be kind of this anchored tenant that I will not give this thing up and I'll use the third best version of something else, if you have it. But if you're not that valuable and important, you're not going to convince people to use something because they're competing against the best in every category.
Vijay Iyengar (19:39):
Exactly. Yeah.
Lenny (19:40):
That is really interesting. I've been doing this kind of series on how different companies approach building product and I have a few questions I'd love to ask around the product development process and Mixpanel.
Vijay Iyengar (19:50):
Sure.
Lenny (19:51):
The first is just like, how do you plan? How do you plan? I know it evolves, but just how do you plan currently? How long are your planning cycles? How far ahead do you plan in detail? Do you use OKRs? Maybe let's start there, those three kind of sub-questions.
Vijay Iyengar (20:04):
We have these unsolved problems and analytics that we're going after. For us that’s like, people always want more power, more simplicity, better data trust, faster onboarding, better collaboration, better price performance. And so we largely organize our teams around those problems and those missions. One quick aside there is that some of those problems have attention with each other. Power and simplicity, there's a trade off there, right? And we want one team to own both, so that they're kind of forced to confront that tension and beat that trade off. And so that's kind of how we think about generally our product team, is these cross-functional EPD teams, each of which that's focused on solving these long-lived paired problems for customers [inaudible 00:20:41] our core analysis team focused on that power, simplicity, trade off problem. In terms of planning, the way it works is that we plan on a six month time horizon. And I can talk about our most recent planning cycle actually, because we're just completing it.
Lenny (20:53):
Yeah, let's do it.
Vijay Iyengar (20:54):
Yeah, basically it started out with this strategy memo that our leadership team wrote that basically just conveys this is where we want to go as a company in the next year, and here's how the product team can contribute most of that and just established these key pillars. We shared that with the teams, and they took that and also combined that with all the quantitative and qualitative context they're constantly consuming about the problem they're working on and our customers, and ideated and developed the series of bets for the next six months, which I think are some extent similar to OKRs, where ABET... The anatomy of ABET is that it's problem we want to solve, our hypothesis on the solution, and then some plan to win, some plan to actually get there and a way to measure that you got there.
(21:32):
And I think one of the unique things that we did relative to other companies that do planning is... I think it usually is sort of this W process of there's the strategy memo, and then teams generate bets and there's a review, and then they go back and I iterate and then they finalize. And we kind of collapsed the middle part of the W where myself and our head of design actually spend time with each of the teams actually ideating on the bets and participating in the solution discovery process, going into the jam sessions and adding fig must keys ourselves with ideas and thoughts on things, which we did because we aren't a huge product team, and we are not going to do 50 things and a half. We're going to do maybe 10 to 12 things.
(22:12):
And so that's enough that we don't... We can do something that doesn't scale if that enables high bandwidth communication between us and the teams. And it ends up being more messy and unstructured ABET in that phase because we're in there contributing ideas as well. But by the end of it, I think the team leaves feeling both more competent in their bets because there's more thought that's gone into it, and then more aligned top to bottom line why we made certain decisions. And so I think that that's one thing that's different. And then we conclude that process with the roadshow where we presented the rest of the company, and then get their feedback as well.
Lenny (22:41):
How long is this process generally?
Vijay Iyengar (22:43):
The teams did pre-work for a couple of weeks, like two weeks in December, and then we did a two week sort of sprint on solutioning and ideation in January, the first two weeks of January.
Lenny (22:53):
Awesome. And what's the end result of planning for each team? Did they deliver a document with, here's our strategy, here's the big bets, here's a roadmap? Is there a template you pass around? How do you get to a thing that people share and present and comment on?
Vijay Iyengar (23:10):
Yeah, I think there's basically three artifacts that are kind of linked to each other. So, the first is we use Notion, and so we have a database in notion called bets, which is where each page in the database is [inaudible 00:23:22]. And that has a template, yeah. So, it's kind of roughly what I described with a few more sections of what problem we're solving? What's the evidence of demand? What's the region impact of this problem? How do we know we're successful? And then what's the key driving hypothesis behind the solution? And then a rough line. And then that's tied with a presentation that's kind of like a tight summary of that that has one slide per bet, and then is also tied with more of an execution focused, how do we sequence and staff this thing and eliminate dependencies, which the engineering team contributes to. So, I think those are the three artifacts that are linked together.

(25:08):
I know you have some insights on prioritization and some strong opinions on how to prioritize. Can you talk a bit about that and how you advise your product teams to prioritize?
Vijay Iyengar (25:17):
One really common framework in prioritization is RICE, reach, impact, confidence, effort. And I think it's simple and fairly robust, which is generally good qualities of a framework. But one of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets, really innovative things. And we encountered this on one of our teams early last year were we just RICE'd everything, all the ideas, and a lot of the high reach, high impact things ended up at the bottom because confidence and effort were just so murky for them, as they should be typically for high reach, high impact ideas.
(25:55):
And so one exercise that we push our teams on is just ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas with engineers and designers in the room committed to actually trying to solve them. Give it a fair shot. And you'll often find if you spend a week on that set of ideas, you can get pretty far in understanding the confidence and the effort. You can probably find a higher confident lower effort way to do them. Then add the C and E back in, and then RICE as usual. And the goal is to end up with a reasonable mix of innovative bets, incremental bets, and then ones that are technical debt or product debt that you need to address.
Lenny (26:31):
I usually just cut out the C myself. I find that it's not that powerful. Do you do this in a Google Sheet? Do you use this in Notion? How do you actually recommend teams do this prioritization, or just eyeball it?
Vijay Iyengar (26:43):
I'm not super opinionated on the exact tools that teams use. I think this is a team local exercise typically, but most teams use Notion and just simple tables or databases in Notion-
Lenny (26:51):
Sweet.
Vijay Iyengar (26:52):
... work fine for this. I think the other thing on prioritization that's always tricky is estimation. And every engineer will value you estimates are all lies, and if you say it'll take eight weeks, it'll take eight months. But I think the core problem with estimation is you're asked to estimate things before what the thing is, and it's just a strange output to be expected to produce. And one approach that I found really interesting is from this book called Shape Up by Basecamp, which this idea of appetite overestimates, where instead of making the estimate an output of planning, you make the time box or an appetite the input, and you say, "We want to solve X problem and we're willing to invest six weeks solving that problem."
(27:31):
The obvious question there is how do you pick that time window? It just seems arbitrary. And so the base camp people suggest just pick six weeks for everything, and they're really austere about if you can't scope hammer something down to six weeks, you're doing it wrong, which I think is... It can work and has a lot of benefits if you creates a rhythm in your company, but one approach I found that works better is pick a reasonable sounding appetite and just explore the two to three options around it. Pick six weeks, and then say, "What would we do differently if we only had four weeks or eight weeks?" And you'll kind of naturally find the efficient frontier of cost and impact, and then align on that. And the important thing is that you check in after that time period and say, "Is there any new information that's just we should continue? Did we uncover the biggest risks, and are we just on the long tail of things?" And actually be honest with yourself about that. I think that's important regardless of what framework you use.
Lenny (28:23):
I really like that. So, is that how you actually operate, you create a time box, we have four weeks for this project, whatever we get done, we ship whatever we don't, we push out?
Vijay Iyengar (28:30):
We operated that way in engineering, particularly on the infrastructure side, because we have this series of projects that would just take forever, and the longer it takes, the longer it's going to take. And so we've done that exercise quite a bit. I'd say more on the more engineering heavy projects than others, but we're starting to adopt it more in the product side as well. The main exercise we've taken on the product side is more the consider, what would you do differently with different time boxes approach?
Lenny (28:56):
Just a thought exercise.
Vijay Iyengar (28:58):
Yeah, it's a good thought exercise. Then it just forces everyone to truly score the requirements. Critical, nice to have, is nice, but really if in two weeks, you're going to get pulled off to do something completely different, what would be a complete solution that addresses the core problem. And it forces you to peel the meat of the problem in first, as opposed to just doing the things that are surrounding it.
Lenny (29:17):
That's cool. I really like that. I've done that myself. I'm curious if anyone ever does the shape up process for real or it's just like we will ship anything that is ready within six weeks and not actually have specific deadlines or kind of concrete goals of products they need to ship in specific ways.
Vijay Iyengar (29:32):
Yeah. Well, I think the shape up process, if you run it all the way. They do... Their idea is that you can actually predict on a six week time horizon. So, you can just hammer down scope to something that is complete. It needs to be complete. It can't be milestone one that's like a half baked thing in six weeks, which I think that rigor... The rigor they applied to that across the board, you need to do it all the way. You can't adopt the process halfway. I think the is the challenge. Otherwise you end up with people shipping milestone one and then moving on, which is not the complete product.
Lenny (30:01):
Makes sense. A couple more questions around how you build product. You mentioned that you have a unique approach to keeping product teams close to customers. And I'm curious what you've learned there, what you found to be helpful and just kind of keeping product teams close to your customers.
Vijay Iyengar (30:15):
I think this is one thing that is something we invested in pretty early on at Mixpanel. Actually around that time, in 2018, when we refocused on our core product, one of our sales engineers, Aaron, built this automation where he piped all these customer gaps that we got that were reported by our customer success and sales teams, piped that into Slack and just a feed. And what this created was this culture where all engineers and designers could consume that raw feed of direct points of customer with no gatekeeper, no process to access it, no pre-aggregation, right? And I think this scale's pretty far. At a product team of our scale and with our reach of customers, we don't get so much feedback that someone couldn't read it in 20 minutes every day. And for four or five years in engineering, every day I would read all the gaps that we got, and many engineers would do that.
(31:04):
And one of the rituals that it's enabled is we'll find that engineers will go into that channel and react with a message with an email emoji, which means I'm going to email this customer and find out more, right? And they'll just email the customer and say, "Hey, I'm the engineer that built this feature. I saw you said this specific thing. Can you tell me more? I'd love to understand." They ask the five why's, and then they improve the product on their own. And I think that culture is just so important, and it just empowers all engineers and designers to think a PM a little bit, which I think takes a little bit of a load off on the PM to be the gatekeeper of all that information.
(31:39):
And then over time, we've evolved it quite a bit as our data stack stack's involved. So, we now not just take customer requests, but we take things that are posted on Twitter and NPS survey feedback and win loss notes from our competitive deals and pipe them both into Slack and into Notion so that we can both get the realtime feed, and then we can sort and aggregate and tag things accordingly. But the key artifact of this is that it's all open. There's no gatekeeper behind that process.
Lenny (32:04):
That sounds both amazing and wild. Do you still allow engineers just to email customers and ask them questions about this stuff, or is that harder to do it as you've grown?
Vijay Iyengar (32:12):
Oh no, we still allow that. Yeah.
Lenny (32:14):
Wow, that's awesome.
Vijay Iyengar (32:15):
One nice thing about the stack actually, the data stack, is that... So, basically all these feeds information land in our data warehouse, which is BigQuery. And from there, they're pushed out via a reverse CTL tool we use called Census to Slack and Notion that make the note code. But one of the benefits of that is that we can enrich all of these feeds with who's the account? What's their ARR? Who's the CSM? And all that other contact information. So, it's usually not an engineer's blindly reaching out to a customer without letting a CSM know if it's a million dollar account or something. The idea is just trust them with that context, and they can tag the right people and make the right call on that.
Lenny (32:50):
I'm so curious how that gets prioritized and how PMs are looped into all that, but we don't have to get too deep in that. That's a really cool process. I haven't seen that before. Our engineers were just emailing customers, digging into questions and problems.
Vijay Iyengar (33:01):
The trap of course is what you just called out is you can't be reacting to everything all the time. And certainly if you ship a redesign, the first two weeks of that, there's going to be a bunch of feedback that's like, I hate this. Go back. And I think that's sort of an organizational muscle you have to build, balance the reaction, and that's just a thing we've had to practice doing, but I think the trade offs are worth it.
Lenny (33:20):
Awesome. One last question along these lines, can you just talk about the tools you use, the SaaS products you use to run your product team for collaboration, communication, notes, docs. You mentioned Notion as an example.
Vijay Iyengar (33:31):
I think our stack is actually fairly standard these days. So, we have Slack, Zoom for communication, Notion for docs and any long form writing, and it's a [inaudible 00:33:42] database, and Figma and FigJam for design and whiteboarding. I think what's actually more interesting is our data stack and the productivity we get out of that. I briefly touched on this, where basically all of our data gets EPL'd out of all the systems we have, lands in BigQuery, gets joined and modeled, and then pushed out via census to all the other tools in our stack. And I think that's been a huge productivity unlock because you can build internal tools with very little code. If you can write SQL, you can build an internal tool basically, and that pushes information to the teams that need it. And so that, I think, just has unlocked a lot of these types of things like automating qualitative signals with no code in a reliable way.
(34:22):
And then if someone like, "Oh, can I get ARR on this?" Yeah, sure it takes two seconds to do that. So, I think that data stack has been a huge productivity unlock for us.
Lenny (34:29):
Awesome. Have you guys shared that anywhere online, just to show kind of the stack you guys have built?
Vijay Iyengar (34:33):
We have a couple blog posts that talks about our stack for... We use this both for our PLG infrastructure and our product, let sales, defining a PQL and alerting a new user who fits that criteria, but then we also use it for internal tools. We have a few blog posts on that topic.
Lenny (34:48):
Sweet. We'll follow up and include some of that in the show notes.
Vijay Iyengar (34:51):
Yeah, definitely.
Lenny (34:53):
Final line of questioning, you're one of the smartest people in the world on product analytics heading product for Mixpanel. I'm curious what you think most people get wrong when they're setting up product analytics for their site, their product, their company.
Vijay Iyengar (35:08):
It's maybe a bit of a hot take because I think so many people-
Lenny (35:11):
There we go.
Vijay Iyengar (35:12):
Yeah, so many people still do this, but I think the biggest mistake is setting up analytics using client side SDKs, client side tracking. So, web and mobile SDKs, putting a mixpanel.track or segment.track in your web app or your mobile apps. And reason it's a hot take is that for many people that's product analytics and SDK tracking are synonymous. They're like, "All right, Mixpanel means SDK, I have to put an SDK in my web and mobile app. But that's a mistake because it... We've just seen time and time again, it leads to poor data quality and difficulty to maintain that data. So, the problem on web is, just due to app blockers and other unreliable things, in the JavaScript world, you end up dropping 20 to 30% of your events, and so it just doesn't match your internal databases.
(35:55):
And then on mobile there's two problems. The first is that you have to reinvent tracking for both iOS and Android because it's two different languages and two different platforms, generally speaking. And so you end up with many duplicate events that semantically mean the same thing, but are just different because of the two platforms, and you might have two teams owning that. And the second issue, which is I think even worse, is that you are kind of beholden to clients updating their mobile app to get to the latest version that has your latest tracking. So if you want to add new tracking, it'll only apply to people at the latest version and beyond. Whereas yet all of your old tracking, whether it's broken or you made a mistake, is still out there in the wild, and so you're constantly getting events that are old and broken.
(36:32):
And so what we recommend instead, and that we've seen a lot more customers adopt recently is just track events from your servers instead of your clients. And that has three benefits. One, it's instantly cross platform. Web and mobile and TV and whatever other platform, they're all going to go through your servers, so you instantly get a hundred percent reach. The second is it's in an environment you control. So if you want to update tracking, you can update it and updates for a hundred percent of users. And then the third thing is that... And this is I think maybe unintuitive, but it's true, is that engineers have been tracking events from servers forever. It's called logs, right? And events are just logs where they user ID in them. And so they don't need to deal with learning a new SDK and dealing with all of that. They just have to track logs that have some structure and a user ID in them. They're tracking events.
(37:18):
And so if it's easier for the developer, it'll get done in a higher quality way. So, I think the really simple advice there is just start tracking events from your servers instead of from your clients. And if you need to supplement it later on with context that's only on the client, you can add that on later, but server side should be the default.
Lenny (37:34):
Maybe a last question is just what's changed most and how companies work with analytics in the past few years? And then just where do you think things are going in the space of analytics?
Vijay Iyengar (37:43):
Yeah, so I think one huge trend is the rise of the data warehouse. So these are Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and they're really scalable and they speak this SQL standard, which has led to this explosion of tools that have emerged around them and make it really easy and cheap to load data into the data warehouse, and then also easy to push data out of the data warehouse by tools that can just do that. And this has a few implications. So, the first is that the data warehouse becomes the center of gravity for all data in your company. Whether it's product marketing and sales data, they all land there. And I think that's really valuable today in this product led growth world, and a lot of incus filled my bad. But from a data standpoint, that means all these teams need to be operating off of the same version of the truth, and that version of the truth is sitting in the warehouse, and it just needs to be joined correctly.
(38:33):
The second thing in terms of where things are going is the events, a time series of users at this action at this time, are the universal data model for analytics. And the reason for that is every action, every interaction a customer has, whether it's with your sales team, like a gong call, or with your marketing team, they clicked on that or viewed marketing article or their product, which is more well known, those are all events. They can all be modeled as events. And it's super granular, super intuitive as a way to understand what people are doing. And it's really powerful, because oftentimes you want to ask questions about sequences of events, right? Which user has spent this much time on my pricing page and then looked at three developer docs? That's probably a user I want to reach out to. So many things can be modeled off of that.
(39:17):
And so I think data warehouse is becoming the loading dock for all this data, which can be very easily modeled this events, but it's not a very great analytical tool for events because SQL is optimized for rows and tables and joints, and not events and sequences of events and segmentations of events. And so one of the things that we're spending a lot of time thinking about is how do we get that really rich, trusted, comprehensive dataset from the data warehouse into a tool that's optimized from the UI down to the data model for events, because that unlocks really fast intuitive exploration of data on dataset that people already have in trust? So, that's, I think, one of the big trends we're excited about and what we see as the future.
Lenny (39:56):
Interesting. And you think Mixpanel is in a good place to help people do that? Is that how see this, there's something that companies like yours will help people solve, or is this something everyone's going to have to figure out for themselves, or there's like a whole new class of startups launching to help them make the mess out of data warehouses?
Vijay Iyengar (40:11):
No, there's always a new class of startups joining in the analytics space. It's never dull moment. Yeah, I think this is something that we are looking to solve, because I mean, analytics only as good as the data. And if people are already collecting great data in the warehouse, I mean we integrate with the warehouse really well, then we get access to that good data. Increasingly, what we've been seeing is that companies like in the reverse ETL phase, like Census and Hightouch are effectively reinventing the CDP reinventing, data movement tool like segment on top of the data warehouse. And so really our strategy there is just tightening our integration with those tools. And we've seen just huge growth and people using their data warehouse as the source for events, not adding SDK tracking anywhere, and just saying, "I already have events sitting here. I trust all of them. They're from all parts of my business. Why can't I do analytics on my support tickets and my gong calls just as easily as I can do it about my user behavior." And so I think that's something we're seeing and we're investing in.
Lenny (41:04):
Awesome. Anything else you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Vijay Iyengar (41:09):
Yeah, we opened talking about the transition from engineering to product, and I think one of the things that's just been really fruitful in my career, both on the engineering side and product side, is just adopting that product mindset and getting closer to customers, consuming the raw feed of customer context, taking every opportunity to talk to them. And I'm really excited to see things like this podcast and your newsletter and other forums for engineers to also develop that product mindset then and get closer to customers, because I think long term, that just means better products and services at lower and lower prices, which is just innovation. So, I'm really excited to see more of that in the world.
Lenny (41:45):
Here, here. With that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got six quick questions for you. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast. Whatever comes to mind, just share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good?
Vijay Iyengar (41:57):
Sure. Let's do it.
Lenny (41:58):
Okay. What are couple books that you recommend most to other people?
Vijay Iyengar (42:02):
On the business book standpoint, there's this book called The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. And it's kind of an old book, but I like it because it's sort of written in this fast-paced thriller model. It's like a fiction book, but it's about this idea of the theory of constraints, finding constraints in a system and how you can remove them to improve productivity. So, I found it's just a fun read, and also really insightful non-technical books that I recommend to folks, particularly those that live in SF, which is Cool Gray City of Love by Gary Kamiya, who is a longtime SF president. And it just goes into the history and the communities, and even the geography of San Francisco, and I've just discovered so many little pockets in the city from reading that book, so it's something I recommend to people who live in San Francisco.
Lenny (42:46):
What's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than this podcast?
Vijay Iyengar (42:50):
I'll do non-tech one for this. So, I'm a huge fan of the show The West Wing, and so there's this podcast called The West Wing Weekly that goes into each episode of the West Wing and brings in actors from the show, as well as folks from government to talk about each episode, and it's just a delight to listen to if you love The West Wing.
Lenny (43:06):
Wait, so they go back to the old show, The West Wing and talk about old episodes with politicians?
Vijay Iyengar (43:11):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:12):
That's cool.
Vijay Iyengar (43:12):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:13):
Wow.
Vijay Iyengar (43:14):
Exactly. So, the show's over. The podcast is over.
Lenny (43:18):
Oh, okay.
Vijay Iyengar (43:18):
You have all seven seasons, but I think it started in 2016 or 2015 or something.
Lenny (43:22):
Got it. So cool. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Vijay Iyengar (43:27):
Pretty mainstream TV tastes. So, I really enjoyed We Crushed and Severance. Those are two good shows I really enjoyed last year.
Lenny (43:35):
Awesome. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're interviewing?
Vijay Iyengar (43:39):
I'm a big fan of open-ended questions, and so one of the questions I ask in the behavioral interview at the start is, walk me through the story of you from college to now, or high school to now, if they're a more junior candidate. And couple interesting things here, interesting to see where people spend most of their time talking and where they don't, and also how they describe the other people on that journey. And do they use a standard framework to describe everyone, or do they go into each person uniquely? So, just tons of follow up questions from that.
Lenny (44:09):
Final question is, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?
Vijay Iyengar (44:14):
Got a lot of inspiration from Gibson Biddle and his product strategy medium thing. And in particular, there's a piece on proxy metrics and the shape of metrics you should use, which I found is a really... The way he frames it is a really elegant way to measure, reach and impact at the same time of your metrics. And then also a big fan of Shishir from Coda, specifically his essays liaison on [inaudible 00:44:37] questions, framing problems, and the one on marginal churn contribution. It's really interesting.
Lenny (44:42):
Amazing. Both guests of this podcast and people I love. Great choices. Vijay, this was awesome. Thank you so much for joining me. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about what you're up to? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Vijay Iyengar (44:57):
I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. I think my handles will be in the show notes. Not super active there, but I definitely check DMs and would love to connect on either of those. And then how can listeners be useful to me? Yeah, I mean, ultimately at Mixpanel, we're building a product for product teams. So, two things. If you haven't used Mixpanel in the last four years, we've changed a lot, as I've described on the pod, so check it out, and happy to take any feedback to help us improve the product.
Lenny (45:23):
Awesome, Vijay, thank you so much.

## Transcript

Wes Kao (00:00:00):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy. I'm a big proponent of asking myself, if I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing? How could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach in writing. Any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:00:35):
I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you are just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people, and it's confusing, you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You have an awesome framework called MOO.

Wes Kao (00:00:54):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. A lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get especially in meetings, we feel blindsided. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. Are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):
Today my guest is Wes Kao. Wes co-created the Alt-MBA program with Seth Godin. She Co-Founded a company called Maven, which I often collaborate with, which makes it easy for people to host live cohort-based courses. She recently left Maven to launch her own course on Executive Communication and Influence. There's a quote that came to mind after I stopped recording this conversation with Wes by George Bernard Shaw, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

(00:01:51):
By the end of this podcast if you listen to what Wes suggests, you'll be a lot closer to becoming a world-class communicator.

Wes Kao (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm very honored to be a second-time guest.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
Very rare honor. No pressure, but I think this is going to be one of the highest leverage episodes I've done and let me tell you why I think that's the case in the newsletter and on the podcast, I often talk about just how important and how high leverage the skill of communication is to product leaders, to leaders, just to people in general. There's this quote that Boz, the CTO of Meta, he's been on the podcast, he wrote this famous blog post, "Communication is the job." And I think that's true for product people, but it's true for basically any sort of leadership role. Anyone trying to get ahead. And you are one of the best communicators I've ever met. You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. You have one of the most popular courses on Maven, on executive communication, so I'm really excited to have you here and to help people become better communicators, better at influence and all these things. So thank you again for being here.

Wes Kao (00:05:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
Okay. So something that I often do with guests on the podcast, not even often, always, I ping people that the guests have worked with and ask them, "What should I ask Wes? What should I know about Wes?" Let me read a few quotes about you in regards to your communication skills from folks that have worked with you-

Wes Kao (00:05:34):
All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
And these are three different people. Okay, so first, "Wes single handedly raised the quality of the entire company's writing by like two X across the board. I always say the best writing course I ever took was working with Wes for a year."

Wes Kao (00:06:07):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:09):
Okay. That's one.

Wes Kao (00:06:10):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:10):
"Wes never just throws things out there, she's precise with her use of language, meticulous about examining her own ideas before bringing them in front of others and knows how to make her points in a way that people will understand them and buy into them." Okay. And third, "Wes includes a reasoning with every proposal in the context behind all of her recommendations so that everyone around her learns in order of magnitude faster. This also makes her an exceptional teacher because she can clearly define what excellence is and why something is the goal, and then break down the steps and principles involved." Okay, reactions.

Wes Kao (00:06:46):
Those are really nice things. That's amazing. Yeah, thank you so much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
And these are people across different companies, so.

Wes Kao (00:06:52):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Okay, so that was just to highlight of how good you are at this stuff. And what we're going to be doing with our chat is going through a bunch of your tactics that you teach and that have helped people become better communicators, executive communicators, better at influence. Before we get into the specific tactics, is there anything that you think is important for people to understand just broadly around the skill of becoming a better communicator?

Wes Kao (00:07:17):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy, there's a lot of avoidable questions, and I'm a big proponent of asking myself, "If I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing to that?" So, you know, instead of blaming other people for not understanding me, I think about how could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have? So I'm a big proponent of agency. And realizing that we can only control our own behavior. And so the best place to start, if you're not getting the reaction you're looking for, is reflecting on how can I get better at the skill of communicating? And it absolutely is a skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
So what I'm hearing is if you're having a hard time people buying into what you're trying to convince them to do or you're finding people are doing not what you asked them to do, it's likely an issue with your ability to communicate, it's probably not their fault.

Wes Kao (00:08:28):
Yeah, I would say so. You can't solve everything with improving your communication, but you can increase the likelihood of getting what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
Cool. Okay. Anything else along these lines of just things that are important to understand just broadly around communication, executive communication?

Wes Kao (00:08:46):
I think another big one that I teach in my course and really kick off with is practicing like it's game day, playing like it's game day. So I see a lot of operators who save their best behavior for executives only. So you know, they want to shine when they're presenting to senior leadership, but with everyone else, they're kind of calling it. And I just don't think that you're going to be able to get enough reps to actually get good at executive communication if you are only doing it with executives. Because many of us only present to execs once a month, right? Or a couple of times a quarter. And that's just not a lot of chance to practice. So really treating every single stakeholder as if they are important because they are, and you shouldn't be if you don't want to waste your CEO's time, you also shouldn't waste your cross-functional team members' time or your manager's time or your direct reports' time. So that's something else that I ask to keep in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
And maybe a last question before we get into the tactics. When people think communication, they think email, they think meeting presentations, things like that. How do you think about, when you talk about executive communication and communication in general, what's kind of the umbrella of things that includes?

Wes Kao (00:09:53):
Yeah, I would say broadly the two mediums are verbal communication and written. So verbal being meetings, conversations, presentations. And written being emails, strategy docs, notion docs, Slack messages, text messages, those two categories broadly. And I also think about communication as more of a means to an end, which might be interesting for some people because I teach a course on communication. So you would think that's like the end in and of itself, but I really see it as a means to an end where the end is getting the ideal outcome you're looking for. So whether that is buy-in or making a good decision as a team or moving to the next step, whatever that might be, communication is really in service of that end goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:43):
Awesome. Okay. So I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach, and talking to folks that you've taught and folks that you've worked with. So I'm just going to go through a bunch and let's just help people get better at these things.

Wes Kao (00:10:58):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
Okay. So the first is something you call sales, then logistics. What is that about?

Wes Kao (00:11:07):
Yes. So a common mistake that I see is overestimating the amount of buy-in that you have from your audience. So that looks like jumping straight into talking about the logistics, the details of the how to do something, of the process. When in reality your audience has not yet decided if they even want to do the thing. So what I see operators do in response then is go even deeper into the logistics and the how, thinking that, "Oh, if I just explain this more than that person will want to do it." When really a sales note is different than a logistics note. A sales note is meant to get people excited to do the thing you want them to do, and to agree to do it. And only then after they have bought in, does it make sense to share the logistics.

(00:11:57):
So there's an order of operations here. If you switch the order of operations, you will likely get a slow response or just no response, right? We've all put a Slack message in a channel and got crickets and tumbleweed. So really starting off with selling the person and making sure that they know why we're doing this, why this matters to the company, why now, and then sharing the logistics tends to be a lot more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Is there an example of that that might help illustrate that point or that approach?

Wes Kao (00:12:27):
Yeah. So one of my clients is a head of operations and she was trying to get the rest of her executive team, which she was a part of, to fill in some wins for the week so that they could share this out with the whole company. And this was going to be motivating, it was going to shine a light on folks. And she led with the logistics of which document to send, to put the details in, what time to put it in by, the format that you should put these wins and didn't really get much of a response from the leadership team, which makes sense, right? Because this totally sounds like one of those things that's another item to check off on your list when you already have so many other things to do and here's this other process that like we're all supposed to do now, like yay, right? And so she wasn't really getting response. And that's because she dove straight into logistics.

(00:13:20):
Whereas what she could have done is start by selling folks, selling the other executives on why are we doing this? Well, we're doing this because this is a chance to shine a light on your team members who are doing amazing work, for them to feel motivated and to feel like the rest of the company really sees them and understands what they're doing. And this is all something that is going to motivate your team, right? So sharing why this is helpful and useful and how this is in service of you and your team versus like, "Oh, this is a favor that you're doing for me to fill out this form and fill it out this way and by this date," et cetera, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
I know that execs often want the opposite where they're just like, "Okay, I know, just tell me what you want to do. Just like, okay, just get to the point. I don't want time for all this context and background." Any advice on when to spend any time on the sales? Like what are signs that, okay, maybe you don't have them sold yet, or what are maybe contexts where you should probably still try to sell them first?

Wes Kao (00:14:20):
Yeah. So I actually think that you should always do a little bit of selling even for situations where people have generally bought in. Because most of us have a lot going on and we're not actively thinking about whatever you're talking about. So even though I agreed to something two weeks ago, by the time you're telling me about it again, like I thought about a billion other things since then, right? So reminding me of why are we talking about this? Why does this matter? And then getting into it and framing that conversation upfront is way more likely for us to not get stuck in a cold start and not kind of go two steps back one step forward.

(00:14:55):
The other thing is, you can frame a conversation and sell a bit at the beginning very concisely. So I'm not talking about spending 15 minutes out of a 30 minute meeting selling, I'm talking about one to two minutes, even a couple sentences, and then transitioning into the main thing you want to talk about. So I'm a huge proponent of doing that and basically reminding people, why are we doing this? Why are we here today? Why does this matter? And then getting into the meat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:24):
I love that. So basically you can do this really briefly, it doesn't have to be a whole pitch for half an hour. It's just a reminder, "Here's why we think this is important." And I think that's such a good point because a lot of times it's like a leader is looking at this thing you're asking them to do and they're like, "Why are we even, why am I spending time on this?" And just a reminder of like, "Okay, I see, I forgot this was going to be, this a part of our strategy, this has this much impact potential or here's how it could help our team be more efficient."

Wes Kao (00:15:52):
Yeah. And you can really do that in like 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
Is there like a, I don't know, structure to this? Is it just like why? Is there a kind of a template you like or some way you recommend of selling first? Is it like, "Here's why we're doing this." Starting like that? Anything along those lines?

Wes Kao (00:16:09):
Yeah. I think explaining why we're doing this, why this benefits the business, what problem this is solving. Again, you can do a lot of this in a couple of sentences. And then I also like asking or stating what I need from the other person upfront. So saying, "Hey, we're here today because two weeks ago we were reviewing the product flow and realized that there were a couple of parts that were kind of confusing. So I took a stab at fixing those areas, rewriting the microcopy, and I want to present them to you today, see if you agree with these changes, and then we're going to roll them out. What I'm looking for from you is feedback on the changes and if you agree." So like that was like 15 seconds, right? Super fast. And then now we're all on the same page about why we're here. And you can listen more intently knowing that I'm looking for a certain kind of feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
I would love to hear it that way. I think there's like an implication here that maybe is worth sharing of just, a lot of this is about communicating effectively to execs, which will make you communicate better to most people. But especially with folks up the ladder. They don't have a lot of time, they have a million things in their head. Maybe just share like why this is so important, like what the state of mind of a leader is that you need to kind of break through.

Wes Kao (00:17:25):
Yeah. So I call it the yes, yes, yes, next, next, next mindset where if I'm listening to direct reports present something to me, very often I find myself thinking, "Got it. All right, yes, let's keep going." Right? And you know, on the other side of that, I've often presented to executives where I had a 15 slide deck and execs would do that and I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like I have a whole sequence, I have a whole order, you know? And sometimes they would give me buy or make the decision by slide four, you know? And I'd be like, "Okay, well you know, slide 13, I want to show you this great graph I put together." Right? And what was really helpful for me was realizing that I should take the win. Okay, if five seconds already agreed, take the win and keep it moving, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):
Yeah. What's that quote like? "If you've sold them, stop talking."

Wes Kao (00:18:16):
Right. Yes. Yeah, you might talk them out of agreeing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
Yeah. Okay. You mentioned being concise. Let's talk about that. You have some really good advice on just how to effectively be concise and not too concise. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:18:31):
Yes. One of my pet peeves is when people are too concise and they equate being concise with brief, being brief. And being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about economy of words. It's about the density of the insight that you're sharing. And so you can have a 300 word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise. And so not equating concision with briefness I think is a really big one to understand.

(00:19:05):
The second thing is a lot of advice about being concise, I think misses an important point. So we've all heard, "Don't bury the lead, cut to the chase." Main point, put the main point at the top, bottom line up front, right? And all of these pithy aphorisms assume that you actually know what your core point is. So you can't cut to the chase unless you know what the chase is. You can't unbury the lead unless you know what the lead is. And so that I found is the bottleneck to being concise. It's actually not really being clear of what you are thinking, that's what's leading to being long-winded.

(00:19:49):
And you can kind of test this theory because most of us have a go-to story that we've told a bunch of times, right? We're like, you know exactly when people are going to laugh, you know when they're going to gasp or hold their breath, right? And why are you so good at telling that story and why are you so concise about it? Because you've told it a bunch of times, you know all of the beats. So in meetings though, at work, we are very rarely talking about the same thing that many times it's always something new. It's something that we are also probably likely processing ourselves and are in the midst of processing as we are in a quick turnaround time, telling someone else about it, telling our team about it. And so you are basically asking your brain to do a lot of different processes, especially in a real time conversation. You're listening to the other person absorbing, making sense of it, processing it, figuring out what you think and how you would react.

(00:20:39):
And then trying to say something cohesive that makes sense, right? And then trying to be concise about it. So it's just a lot of different processes. And so the only solution I found consistently to being concise is preparation. It's not a very glamorous solution by any means, but the clearer I am going into a meeting, going into a conversation, going into a pitch, the better I am at being concise and being able to bring the conversation back to the most important points at being able to stay flexible, but also firm and preparation. I don't mean spending hours and hours preparing for a weekly meeting, even a couple of minutes really makes a huge difference.

(00:21:25):
Most of us are so back to back in meetings that we're doing zero preparation. It's like the meeting has started 30 seconds in and you're still unwinding from the last Zoom call that you were on, right? So most of us are in that mental state. So if you even take 30 seconds to one minute to ground yourself on why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across in the time that we have, you're going to go in there so much more focused and so much more able to be concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
So the advice there, so this is for meetings and I want to talk about writing also, but for meetings, the advice here is before you get into a meeting, actually think about why am I in this meeting? What do I want to get out of it? Instead of in the meeting figuring out a lot as you go, which to your point, you're just going to ramble and be like, "Oh, okay, here's what I actually want to say."

Wes Kao (00:22:10):
Yeah. And what might I want to share in the meeting too? You know, especially for more introverted folks. Sometimes you need to decide beforehand that you want to speak and you want to make sure you get a certain point across. So even deciding that beforehand makes a huge difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:25):
Yeah, I found this extremely powerful just like five minutes before you get into a meeting. And it could happen earlier in the day, right? It doesn't have to happen right before the meeting, or worst case, it's right before the meeting. Just, "Okay, what do I want to get out of this? What am I here? What do I want to say?" And just like giving your brain a little bit of time to prepare. Super powerful. In writing, is there like any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:22:50):
I think the main tactic is to remind yourself to be concise. And usually when I do that, I end up trimming 20% at least of what I wrote, tightening up some sentences. I also ask myself, how might I be adding cognitive load to whatever it is that I'm saying? So is there a tighter, clearer, cleaner way that I can ask what I'm asking or present the information I'm presenting or make the recommendation that I'm making? And usually if you even ask yourself that, your brain automatically comes up with stuff. You just see whatever you wrote differently and you're like, "Oh shit, I could trim this entire paragraph because that's secondary." And maybe you have your primary message in Slack, and then within the thread add some of the secondary stuff, right? So I find that most of us, it's reminding yourself to be concise. And once you think of it, your brain naturally will see places where you can trim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
There's a layer of advice under this that you're not saying that I'm going to say, which is actually look at the thing you wrote at least once before you share it. Because I used to be really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. I wrote this doc, send it, get feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. We wrote this doc, send it, get feedback. All right. Send this email. I don't have time to read this email." And I find just forcing yourself to look at it solves so much of this.

Wes Kao (00:24:10):
Oh, yes, yes, definitely. I was assuming before doing that, but you're right, some people might not be. And yes, definitely reading your own message first is huge. And yeah, I find that even doing that you can often spot a lot of low-hanging fruit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Right. You'll find the typos and grammar issues and you'll be like, "Oh, I don't need this word." Along those lines, let me share two books. People always ask me, "How did you learn to write?" I'm like, "I'm not a writer, I don't know what I'm doing." But two books really helped me write more effectively. And one is specifically to help you write more concisely called On Writing Well. I don't know if you've read that.

Wes Kao (00:24:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Okay. And it's basically chapter after chapter of, "Here's what you can cut. And you can cut more. And look what more you can cut and cut this stuff." And he has screenshots of essays that students have written in his class and he's like, "Look at all those words you cut and nothing has changed. It's exactly the same message and even is better with 40% of the words cut."

Wes Kao (00:25:12):
Is this by Sol Stein or another author?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):
I don't have it... It's somewhere in my bookshelf. So we'll look it up.

Wes Kao (00:25:19):
Yeah, there's a writing book by Sol Stein that I absolutely love. And I feel like it might be called On Writing Well, but then also I could see there being multiple books called On Writing Well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
There's also Writing Well I think by Stephen King, that's another one that people love, but there On Writing Well is the one I really loved because it's very tactical.

Wes Kao (00:25:37):
Going back to something that you were saying earlier with rereading what you wrote, I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. So if you're just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people and it's confusing and you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. All 15 of these people are reading this being like, "Okay, what do I do with this?"

(00:26:05):
Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races. They would've read your message and then known exactly what to do next or what their part was or what you were looking for from them. So I think about that a lot too. It's not just me writing this and sending it off. It's, "Who are all the people who are going to come in contact with this message who are going to refer to it and use it? And if I just take 30 more seconds to make sure that it's clean, how much can I unblock from their work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:34):
That's such a good point. I like that, I love that term blast radius. It's such a good point. Just like there's so much negative leverage in writing inefficiently and inconcisely. If you spend like... Inconcisely? I don't know the word is there, but if you just spend three minutes spending a little more time making it more clear just like the impact and leverage that has, that's such a good point. I looked up the books, it's so funny. Okay, so there's On Writing Well by William Zinsser. There's Stein On Writing by Sol Stein, which is what you said you were talking about. And then Stephen King has a book called On Writing. Everyone's got the same.

Wes Kao (00:27:09):
Yeah. Common title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:12):
Not ideal for SEO but On Writing Well is the one that I love by William Zinsser. There's also one called A Series Of Short Sentences if you haven't seen that one. It's a really good rate too. It's just how to write short sentences and just the power of just keeping sentences short, which I struggle with.

Wes Kao (00:27:27):
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:28):
Okay. Back to our agenda. There's another framework/tactic that I've heard you recommend. It's called signposting. What is signposting?

Wes Kao (00:27:38):
Signposting is using certain words, phrases, formatting, and an overall structure in your writing that helps guide your reader and signals what is coming in the rest of the post. So, this is especially helpful if you have a long memo. It adds structure to where are we going and what certain sections of paragraphs are about. So some of my favorite signposting words are, "for example," shows that you're about to show an example because shows that you're about to share your logic and rationale behind something. "As a next step," is a great one. People's eyes automatically zoom to, "as a next step." Even "First, second, third," kicking off a paragraph with that, you're not needing to rely on rich text formatting with bolding, italics, underlines and all that craziness. If you kick off sentences with signposting words, you can often signal, "Here's what I'm about to talk about in this paragraph."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
These are power words for clarity. There's this whole concept of power words like, "free."

Wes Kao (00:28:47):
Yeah. "A gift."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
"Gift." Yeah. For copywriting and these are basically power words for helping your brain see the structure and get to the thing you want to pay attention to. So I'll read back the words you just used. "For example," " because," "as a next step," and then, "first, second, third."

Wes Kao (00:29:05):
Yeah. Yeah. You can use signposting in writing and verbally too. So if you're doing a product demo, you might say something like, "The most important part to pay attention to is, blank." Or, "The part that we were most surprised by is, blank." Or, "The part that customers are," et cetera. Right? So it's, you're signaling that whatever comes after this thing is something that you may want to pay attention to. So it's a great way not only to add structure, but to also grab people's attention back if it has strayed some time as they were either listening to you or reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:42):
Along those lines, I find I find formatting really helpful here, just bold and bullets. I know you have a pet peeve with too much formatting. How much is too much formatting?

Wes Kao (00:29:51):
I really hate excessive formatting. So, I've seen memos where 30% of the note was bolded. And that just negates the entire point of bolding because if everything is bolded then nothing is being highlighted, right? So I think using formatting in general more sparingly than you think you have to is probably a good rule of thumb. I also dislike when people overuse bullets and sentence fragments, phrases in bullets when they should use complete sentences that actually show the connected tissue between ideas, that show the logical flow of what it is that you're saying.

(00:30:33):
And it feels faster and more concise to put bullets and fragments, but a lot of times your reader on the other end of that is needing to decipher and interpret and guess what you actually meant. So it net, net takes longer. And I also think that it can be a little bit of a crutch, it can be a little bit lazy because you are telling yourself that you're being concise when really, if you had to turn your sentence fragment into a full sentence, a lot of times it actually is harder than you think because you realize that you actually didn't really know exactly what you meant. So as you're trying to turn it into a full sentence, you're actually needing to use brainpower.

(00:31:15):
So that's I think a great litmus test of, "Was that idea fully thought out?" Because if it was, you should be able to really quickly turn it into a complete sentence. And many times, you actually aren't. So I see people like basically think, "Oh, I want to make this easier to read, more skimmable. I'm just going to throw a bunch of formatting and bullets and turn everything into bullets." And it's not quite that easy of a solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:41):
This is very much along the lines of the whole Amazon six-page memo where Jeff Bezos just realized, "If you can't write it out as a long memo and explain yourself in prose, you don't actually know what you're saying." And it's a really good filter for helping people actually crystallize and know themselves, "Okay, I see. I don't actually know what I'm doing here." And I love this is a microcosm of that. Can you just make a bullet point a real sentence versus a fragment of a sentence?

(00:32:06):
I'm thinking about as a listener being like, "Okay, how do I actually get better at this?" So maybe let's take a tangent. I know that you teach a whole course, you do all this stuff hands-on with people to help them actually build these skills. For someone that hasn't taken the course or isn't taking it, what's a good way to start practicing these skills and know if what you're writing is getting better, is good. Is it find a mentor, find someone that you think is a great writer and have them review stuff? Any tips there?

Wes Kao (00:32:34):
Yeah. So I have a pretty first principles driven approach for this, which is to think about how long does it take me right now to get to the reaction I'm looking for from my recipient? If it takes a bunch of back and forth and a bunch of friction, then that's my baseline. And once you start practicing some of these communication skills, how does that speed up? If you would have had seven different touch points of back and forth, does that shrink to two to three?

(00:33:08):
Not every point of friction is going to be avoidable, but a lot of it is if you get better at communicating. So I like watching for the reaction and how quickly and how enthusiastically I'm able to get that reaction. And for the things that are working, do more of that. For things that are not working, adjust your execution because it might not be that the tactic doesn't work, it might be your execution of it wasn't great. And keep trying, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:35):
So the advice here is just see how well you're writing/meeting/suggestion goes, how well it does. And if it's not like there's the ideal immediately, "Yes, let's do it." And then there's the, "I don't really understand." There's the spectrum of response. And what I'm hearing is just pay attention to if the speed to getting what you want is increasing in general.

Wes Kao (00:33:59):
Yeah, yeah. I don't think that there's any single shortcut on how to get better besides that. I do think that being fascinated by a topic and being excited about it makes it more likely that you're going to find it fun to try all these different things and try different ways to get through to people. So, I would approach it with a hypothesis-driven experimental mindset and almost like a game. Like, "When I do this, how does that other person react? If I frame it this way, do I get a different reaction? When I try this, am I able to cut through the noise more?"

(00:34:39):
Yeah. So I really think it's about practicing. And I will say that the way not to do it is to try to incorporate 30 different tactics at the same time and then beat yourself up when you don't remember to do them. It's really easy when you are learning a new field or function to get overwhelmed when you're learning a new skill. And the way to build a habit is usually not changing so many different things at once. It's picking one thing that you want to try and keeping that top of mind, trying it in a bunch of different settings in different ways. And getting it better at that thing before moving on to the next thing.

(00:35:19):
So that's like a really common thing I see in my course is people feeling overwhelmed. And I always remind folks that, "You are building a new habit here. And be patient with yourself, take it step by step."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:31):
There's a lot of stuff we're talking about here that a lot of people might be like, "This is so minor. What? I just bullet point sentences, be a little... Tell them the why at the beginning."

(00:35:41):
And I just want to share in my experience the biggest jump I made in my career was actually getting better at these very specific skills. I had this manager, Vlad, who's been on the podcast and I talk about him regularly, who was such a stickler about communicating well and being very clear and concise and thinking and just spending more time on documents and emails, on strategy docs. Just like, "No, this isn't ready. Spend more time, here's something that's not clear." And just doing that was such an accelerant for me.

(00:36:12):
And it's all these little things. That's what's interesting about it. It's like everything seems really minor but it all adds up to a lot of impact because to your point, people see it, "Okay, cool, I get it, let's go." Versus like, "I don't like this idea." And then it's like it all falls apart. So I guess any reactions to that?

Wes Kao (00:36:29):
Yeah. All these little things compound and make a big difference. I often hear people think, "Well, this individual instance, this individual email, the Slack message is not worth spending a couple more minutes on. It's just an email or it's just a Slack message." The problem with that line of thinking is that no one instance of something is ever going to feel important enough to spend a little bit more time on that. And then, but when you zoom out, that's like, "Well that's all your work then. This is literally everything you've touched. This is all your work output then." because any piece of that process you thought wasn't worth spending time on and now this is just the quality of your work and it's not as good as it could be.

(00:37:15):
So yes, these might seem minor but A, it compounds. And also B, all the "big things," everyone else is already doing. So, there's not a lot of alpha in that. Whereas if you are paying attention to skills that people think are boring or too basic and realizing that's a lever that you can pull, that someone else thought, "Oh, we're hitting diminishing returns on that. I'm not going to spend more time on that." But you realize that there's actually more juice left to squeeze there and you decide to squeeze that juice. Well, now, you have extra juice that the other person doesn't have.

(00:37:56):
So yeah, in my experience I find that people claim the point of diminishing returns way too early. And this isn't just for communication, this is for strategies, tactics, et cetera. They'll try something once, a mediocre attempt and be like, "This channel doesn't work. This tactic doesn't work." It's like, "Really? Because it's working for a lot of other people who are getting really creative with it."

(00:38:19):
I'm not saying that everything has to work for you but for you to claim, "This thing just doesn't work," feels a little bit intellectually dishonest. It's more likely that your skill level, your creativity, your execution ability was not good enough. And that's fine. Let's admit that to ourselves because if we admit that, then we can do the hard work of getting better at those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
It feels like if you really boil this down, all the advice comes down to just spend a little more time on all these things you're putting out.

Wes Kao (00:38:51):
I like thinking about it as a little bit more upfront investment. And it is an investment. It's not just time. It's an investment because yes, it takes a little bit longer to make a Slack message a little bit better, but net, net if you save a bunch of questions and back and forth and people asking you things that you don't think they should be asking, then by investing a little bit of upfront effort, you've prevented all that from happening. So yeah, it is a little bit more time in the moment but reaps a lot of benefits down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):

(00:40:42):
You mentioned Slack. I have a great quote also about you that I didn't read that I'm just going to read right now from someone that worked with you. She said she searched the Slack channel at the company you worked at for old posts from Wes for inspiration for what to ask you. And she said you had zero half-baked thoughts, 100% complete sentences, perfect punctuation, clear takeaways at the top of every message. It's the kind of thing you don't notice in isolation, but once you see everyone else's messages in a remote-first company, it's a stark contrast.

Wes Kao (00:41:14):
Yeah, thank you. I will also say that as someone who tries to walk the talk, I feel like I get a pretty good response rate pretty quickly for the things that I ask for, for the recommendations I'm making. It's not instant, it's not 100%, but over time I've realized that improving my communication has led to people receiving my ideas better. Ideas that used to be locked in my head that I would get frustrated that no one else understood. People were now understanding and that feels really good. That's very, very exciting and it made me want to do it more and pay more attention to that. So that's going back to what I said earlier about watching for what's working. There's momentum is really encouraging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):
And I totally feel that. If you start getting the things you want, that feels great. I'd be like, "Okay, cool."

Wes Kao (00:42:08):
Yeah, more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
"Let's do more of that." Yeah, and again, it's like very minor things. It's like a couple more minutes on the Slack message, a couple more minutes on email.

Wes Kao (00:42:16):
Very doable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):
Yeah, which everyone can do. There's no magic here, it's just spend a little more time and use some of these tactics that we're talking about. Speaking of that, let me talk about another tactic. Apparently you have some really good advice on finding the right level of confidence in what you're saying. There's always this question of, "I come to this leader. How confident should I be about, 'This is the answer,' versus, 'Here's a bunch of ideas'?" What do you think? What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:42:41):
I find that people tend to naturally be on the spectrum a little bit too confident as a baseline or not confident enough. So people who are too confident might state hypotheses as if they are fact. So that really bothers me. That's another one of my pet peeves, where if you say, "This is X," or, "This will X," that is different than saying, "This could X," or, "This might X," or, "This will increase the likelihood of X."

(00:43:12):
So I'm a big proponent of speaking accurately. You can avoid a lot of problems if you speak accurately about your level of conviction and about the actual amount of evidence that you have for something. It's okay for something to be an initial hunch. Say, "It's an initial hunch." Don't act like this is something that you are super sure about. You've proven out that this is absolutely this way because the rest of your team is listening to you at face value. And y'all might spend real headcount and dollars pursuing something that you have advocated for in a way where you overreached with your level of confidence.

(00:43:52):
So, that's for people who are overconfident. It's equally a problem if you're under-confident. So I have some clients who their CEO asked them to share some recommendations with another team because they've run something before and so they share all this amazing information and at the end they're like, "Oh, but you can ignore everything I just said. Obviously, make your own decision. Do what you think is best. And if you want to just ignore everything, that's totally cool too." And it's like you just didn't have to say that. You could say, "Make your own decision, take all this into account," but you don't have to diminish to that degree.

(00:44:31):
And so again, speaking accurately, if you have really strong reasons to recommend something to the cross-functional team, it's almost irresponsible to act like you are not really sure and it's just this random idea, "Hey, try it if you want to." We might lose a lot of money and time if we don't take this idea, right? So again, speaking accurately is so, so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
Is a simple way to think about then the right balance is have a point of view, have a recommendation, present accurate facts, and be clear when you are not? "It's not actually 100% true, but here's a hunch I have, or here's a theory we have."

Wes Kao (00:45:11):
Yeah, I think sharing a point of view, sharing a recommendation, and then backing it up with evidence, with logic, with first principles, with examples, with data, if you have it. Not every situation you're going to have data for, especially if you're building something new. So this is where first principles comes in. Even explaining how you got to where you got to and why you think this is going to work, that all gives your team, your manager, something to push back on, to poke holes on or to align on and say, "Yeah, I agree here, but I disagree on this part."

(00:45:44):
So you can talk about ideas with a lot more specificity when you share your thought process. And you can frame it all kicking off saying, "My initial thinking is," or, "Based on what we know, my hunch is, blank." So speaking accurately and then still bringing up those facts so that we can all make as informed of a decision as we can make given what we know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Advice I got that really helped here for me was to try not to be biased with how you frame everything. You have your suggestion for how to do something. It's easy to just bias all of the data to point in that direction. And if people notice that, they're like, "Oh, okay. Well, I can't really trust this because I see you're just like, you clearly have an agenda." So it's a little bit like having an agenda and a POV, but be clear about what is actually true. Be accurate.

Wes Kao (00:46:36):
Yeah. I think anytime people have to discount what you're saying because you are biased in this way is not great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:45):
Is there an example by any chance that highlights what you're describing here?

Wes Kao (00:46:49):
Yeah, so in my course I talk about not being a single-minded martyr. So single-minded martyr is someone who very much has an agenda, who wants the recommendation to go through and is presenting a bunch of evidence, supporting that direction. And then gets really frustrated when other people are not seeing it or are skeptical. And so one of my clients was a single-minded martyr in a recommendation she was making. So she was on the growth acquisition side of her company. And was having trouble with cross-functional team members lending headcount to her project. And so everyone would say like, " Oh, yes, we believe in this, this is important," but wouldn't want to actually give her half of their engineer for two weeks.

(00:47:36):
And we were talking about it and as we were talking, she revealed that the CEO had at the beginning of the year said that the company-wide goal is retention that year. That their biggest challenges and areas of opportunity were in retention, not necessarily in growth. And once she zoomed out and realized this, she was able to put her recommendation in context. And realized that it's not just-

Wes Kao (00:48:00):
... recommendation in context. And realize that it's not just I'm the only one who cares about this company. Everyone is a hypocrite. They say they believe this, but don't actually want to work on it. Before that was kind of her narrative, but once she zoomed out and realized she was being a single [inaudible 00:48:16], she could better fit her proposal in the context of what else was happening in the organization. I think actually this is a really big difference between more junior people versus more senior people. More junior people are like, "I need to win. I need to get a yes for this proposal and I'm going to keep advocating for it until I get a yes." Whereas really sometimes the best decision for the company is not right now. This doesn't actually fit our priorities right now, right?

(00:48:42):
Or maybe yes, but let's right size the level of investment. So it might look like half whatever the size of what that recommendation actually was, and having the maturity to realize that, to put your idea into context is huge. That took me a really long time to learn and I think that goes under the umbrella of always do what's best for the company, not necessarily what's best for me, my career, my team, my wins. If you prioritize what's best for the company, that helps you have a more right-sized way of still advocating for your ideas, but doing it with a bit more equanimity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
And also just connecting to what the company is. Just this idea of if the thing you're pitching is not aligned with what is important to the company right now, it's unlikely to be prioritized. It makes sense. This is why leaders choose, here's what matters most. We got to do the things that are going to help us drive this thing right now, like retention or revenue. And so that's just, I think, a sub tactic there is just whenever you're pitching something, connect that to the goal of the person you're pitching to so that they're like, "Oh, I see how this is going to help me. That's great. Let's do it. Great advice."

(00:50:01):
And I think this is something a lot of people run into. It's just, "Why aren't they listening to me? Why don't they want... That's such a good idea. They hate me." It's something, "Oh, I bet they hate me. They don't trust me." When it's just like, okay, this isn't a priority right now. Let's come back to it another time. Okay. I'm going to get to a couple more tactics and then I'm going to shift directions to talk about managers and being manager. You have an awesome framework called MOO. What is MOO? What does it stand for and what is it all about?

Wes Kao (00:50:26):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. M-O-O. And the thought there is that a lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get, especially in meetings where we feel blindsided, that was unexpected, and then we're on our back foot. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get when I share this, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. So are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely. And so this is where knowing your own argument in and out, including counterarguments becomes so important. So knowing your counterarguments as well as you know the arguments for doing the thing. When you do that, when you have prepared in that way, you're less likely to feel caught off guard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
When you hear you talk about this, it's like, obviously I shouldn't do this, but very few people actually do this, actually spend a couple minutes, " Okay, here's what I'm going to pitch."

Wes Kao (00:51:31):
Even a couple seconds, really. Really, even a couple seconds, your brain will think of something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:38):
Is there a story or an example of this that you share that highlights this idea of the power of MOO?

Wes Kao (00:51:43):
I use MOO multiple times a day, every day, every single day. Literally whatever I'm about to say I think how might someone disagree with this or what might an objection be? So whatever it is I'm writing, saying, it's a really good mental filter because it encourages you to think a couple steps ahead in kind of a structured way, right? If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me. Well, if I take that into account, I can volunteer that information upfront or I can frame it in a way where they're less likely to think that that's an issue.

(00:52:19):
And so it's muscle memory for me at this point, and this might be something we include at the end is something to start with. But putting MOO on a post-it, Most Obvious Objection, what is someone likely to object about? And then just keeping that top of mind. It's a great way to train yourself to empathize with your audience and with your recipient. We all say that and we all know we should do it, but for me this is a really tactical concrete way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:50):
I think what's great about a lot of the tactics you're sharing is not only is it going to help you communicate it better, but it helps you actually think and crystallize it better for yourself because you may realize, oh, that's a really good objection. Like, oh, the objection's probably going to be this. Will it drive enough impact for the business? Oh, that's a great point. Maybe I should not pitch this right now.

Wes Kao (00:53:10):
Yeah. It definitely helps shape your own thinking. I think communication and thinking are so much more interrelated than we think. I think people think there's a thinking as phase one and then communicating the thinking, and the reality is a lot more intertwined. And I loved your example there that thinking ahead to what might be the most obvious objection actually then prompts you to realize that maybe there was a gap in what you were planning to present and then you now have an opportunity to strengthen that pitch before you say it out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
There's a quote I have highlighted on this podcast a number of times that I love that is exactly along these lines by Joan Didion. "I don't know what I think until I write it down." I know exactly that feeling. Okay. So there's a couple more things that people have shared that you are amazing at helping them get better at. One is just keeping your cool and staying calm during very high stakes, real-time conversations when things maybe aren't going your way or if you disagree with someone, any advice on that, it feels like you're really good at this.

Wes Kao (00:54:17):
I think one thing that tends to throw people off is putting a lot of pressure on themselves to get the exact right answer. So if they are asked a question and they don't know the answer, a lot of people will then kind of freak out. And I was taught early in my career that if you don't know the answer, you should say, "Let me look into it, I'll get back to you." So that's a fine approach. It's definitely better than making something up, right? So definitely don't make something up. But if you are more experienced and have some confidence in your subject matter area, just saying I'll get back to you, is sometimes a missed opportunity. You can ask for a bit more information to be able to continue the conversation in that moment. So let's say that your exec says what percentage of users came from mobile last month and you don't have that number off the top of your head.

(00:55:20):
So person A says, "Let me look into it and I'll get back to you." Person B might say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter the number has been 60 to 70% and it's grown in the past year, so mobile is now a bigger part of our business, et cetera. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately or where's that commission coming from, basically? Right? And so being able to answer a similar question in the direction you think the person is asking about and then validating why they're asking that question allows you to still continue that conversation in the moment. I call it the question behind the question, sometimes you get a question, but underneath there's a deeper underlying concern.

(00:56:10):
And many times people don't even know that it's there, right? Subconscious. So it's not nefarious, they're not withholding anything from you. But when you are explaining something and you're kind of getting multiple questions on the same thing, it's a good sign that there might be a deeper question behind the question and it's our responsibility to figure out what might that be. And so probing, asking for a bit more information, answering in that general direction and then validating these are all techniques you can use when you are in the moment without feeling like, oh, I must have every single thing prepared and the moment that I'm caught off guard, everything goes to shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
Another tactic along these lines that's very similar to what you're describing, but I'll share that I learned that was really helpful is just if you're not sure what to say, basically just reflecting back their question and just being like, let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for. You want to understand monthly retention for, and then maybe clarify. And that one gives you time to think about it as you're talking. Two, it helps the person recognize, "Oh, he hears me. Great. Okay, this is good. He's thinking about this." And then at the end of that you could be like, "Okay. I don't actually have that specific number. Let me think about it." Or, "I have the quarterly number. Okay. That's what I know." So there's an interim step almost that I'll add into your piece of advice of just reflect back their question, just better understand what they're looking for.

Wes Kao (00:57:32):
Yeah, I love that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:34):
Awesome. Okay, let's go back to what I said we do. Let's pick one tactic that you think people should try first, maybe one or two. So let me read the ones we've gone through and then see what you think would be a good first step. So one is starting with sales, before getting to logistics and giving people the why signposting using specific words to help people guide the doc and not get overwhelmed. Finding the right level of confidence, having a POV, that sort of thing. Getting better, being concise, MOO, not overusing formatting, something else you shared. And then this idea of when you don't know the answer, not saying I'll get back to you as the default, maybe giving them a different answer, maybe asking them more questions. Across those, which do you think someone should try to like, "Okay. Let me start here."

Wes Kao (00:58:25):
I would start with Most Obvious Objection and also framing your conversation up front. And that kind of relates to using signposting words if needed to help you frame that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:37):
Sweet. That's such an easy one to remember. Just MOO. Okay. So stick a post it somewhere when you're about to share something in Slack and ask someone for something, present in a meeting, send a strategy, and just think about for a few seconds what might be the most obvious objection to what I'm trying to ask them to do. Great. Okay. So let's talk about management. And there's kind of two sides to it. Being a manager and being a person reporting to a manager, you have a bunch of really good advice here. One is there around managing up. One of my most popular posts in the early days was advice for managing up and just how important it is. What advice do you have for someone to get better at managing up? Why is that even so important? Why do you think people may be under appreciating how important it is to manage your manager, let's say.

Wes Kao (00:59:18):
One of the most common myths about managing up that I definitely felt early on in my career was that I would have to manage up if I were more junior, but eventually I would outgrow it, that I would get senior enough that I would no longer have to do it. And it was a rude awakening that no matter how senior I got, managing up, I not only had to manage up, it actually became more important. So I think managing up is one of those skills that if you invest in learning it, it serves you now and for the rest of your career. And I realize that many senior people are actually the best at managing up. That's partially how they got to be so senior in the first place. But also, the more senior you get, the less likely that your manager is going to give you really well-defined tasks and problems on a silver platter and ask you to solve them.

(01:00:09):
You are going to be dealing with more ambiguity and you're going to be dealing with sometimes a mandate like make this number go up or create this division, right? Where you need to manage up and make sure that your leader, your manager, is in the loop about what you are about to try and what you're about to do and make sure that they're aligned. And so for me, realizing that managing up is something that is ongoing and that it shifts and evolves and looks different as you go in your career, that was a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
Just that even if you become even a VP, if you become a director and still something you want to invest in, any specific tactic or advice for how to manage up well.

Wes Kao (01:00:54):
The biggest one is to share your point of view. So this some people are surprised by because they think I'm going to say do a weekly recap of the tasks that you worked on or what you contributed. And that is a good idea, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I think the more highly leveraged way to contribute and manage up is by being more vocal about sharing your point of view. When you just ask your manager, "Hey manager, what should we do?" You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" You give them something to build off of and that reduces the amount of mental lift that they have to put forth.

(01:01:54):
And so sharing your point of view more readily, backing it up with evidence, that's a wonderful way of making your manager's life easier. And also showing that you are an active rigorous thinker who is thinking strategically about the business. You're not just waiting to be told what to do, you're not expecting them to figure things out and then tell you you are actively looking around the corner trying to solve problems, forming hypotheses in your mind, observing and noticing things. And again, sharing your point of view doesn't mean that you have the perfect answer. You can share that, "Hey, I've noticed this problem popping up in a couple of different places. Here's what I think might be happening."

(01:02:36):
Or when you share a report, don't only share the report and expect your manager to come up with insights and takeaways. You should look at the report too and point out insights and takeaways. So it's really changing that posture from more reactive and more waiting to be told what to do or kind of staying in this narrow box to being willing to share your recommendation, your point of view, share what you're noticing, and this is something that even junior people could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:04):
I was going to say exactly that. I think not only is it something junior people can do, this is a really good way to get promoted and to take on more leadership opportunities. You coming to your manager with, "Here's something I think we should do. Here's a perspective I have. Here's an opportunity." If you were in charge, you're like, how awesome would it be for people to come to me with amazing ideas and have clear recommendations? That sounds great. Everyone wants that. So if you can do that, amazing. Who wouldn't want that? But then what's interesting is similar to how writing helps you crystallize your thinking, you coming in with a recommendation forces you to really think deeply about it because that's putting your reputation on the line. So there's a second order effect of it makes you actually spend more time on the thing and be clear about why you think this is a good idea and do more research. So a lot of wins here.

Wes Kao (01:03:53):
There are a lot of situations where you might have the most visibility into a problem. You might have the most proximity into an issue. And so if you're not speaking up about it and sharing what you're observing, sharing what you're noticing, your manager doesn't necessarily have visibility into that. And so I've heard so many managers say that they want their junior people to speak up more because their junior people have often close contact with customers, with support tickets, with cleaning data, with a bunch of things where the manager would love to hear insights from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
If you're not having success with this, if you're hearing this and be like, but it never worked, my manager doesn't listen to me, listen to the rest of this podcast we just did, which is basically advice on how to effectively convince someone of a thing. It's like, tell them why this is a problem, be really concise about it, sign post words, all these things. That's exactly what this whole conversation's been about. Okay. Let's see. We have a couple more really cool tactics that people have suggested we talk about. One is how to give feedback well, how to do better, how to be more effective at giving feedback. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (01:05:05):
I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression. And so the idea here is that most of the time, by the time we are giving feedback to someone, we have been frustrated for a while. I used to be very conflict diverse, so I would wait and try to convince myself that I wasn't bothered by something until I really couldn't hold it in anymore. Then I would schedule a one-on-one with a coworker to tell them the feedback and it would inevitably turn into a venting session where I was in the name of sharing the impact of what they did would share all my frustrations and all the ways that they have basically harmed me and made my life difficult. And this would be very counterproductive because the person would either feel like and feel really demoralized or they'd get really defensive and they'd want to argue with me about how what they did actually was not that bad or it was partially my fault too or whatever.

(01:05:59):
And so I realized that a better way of giving feedback is thinking about motivating the person's behavior change. The goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change, help them understand the benefit to them as well as to the people around them. And so usually for me, that's trimming 90% of the initial stuff that I want to say and really keeping only that 10%. And that's made a really big difference. Whenever I am giving constructive feedback of any kind, I always keep that in mind. And when I don't do it, I almost always regret it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Someone close to me in my life is working on the skill, which is there's just, "I want people to know how they messed up. Justice. I need this to be fair." And what I always recommend is just think about what you want to get out of this conversation, what do you want from them? And then, okay, what's the best way to get that? Versus just making sure they hear you and making sure they understand how screwed up this was. And that's basically what you're saying is focus on the outcome you want to achieve, not something that's useful, something that will make you just feel better.

Wes Kao (01:07:23):
Yeah. I definitely think that having a space to vent and to share those frustrations is important. So you want to get that out before you go into the conversation with your counterpart. So whether it's talking to your therapist or your partner or friend, you want to basically get all that energy out because otherwise you bring it into the conversation and it doesn't take much to set you off. You might have a whole script, you're controlled, you're calm, and then you start talking and the other person raises an eyebrow and is acting a little incredulous at what you're saying, and that's all it takes for you to snap and be like, "You're surprised? You're incredulous? Why are you incredulous?" Right? And then you're off, right? Yeah. Getting that energy out, I would say step one, so that you can go into the conversation clear, grounded, setting that emotional tone that is more positive and that allows you to stay focused on only the part that will get them to behave in the way you want them to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Such good advice. And I think we come back to are you getting the outcomes you want? If you're not, this is another reason it might be the case is you just need them to hear your mind. I just need you to know. And I think a lesson here is that may not be the best path to getting what you want, but it may feel good. Maybe people are like, "Ah, but I really want them to know this."

Wes Kao (01:08:42):
There's that great Einstein quote about insanity being repeating things that you're doing expecting a different outcome. And I feel like that applies so much to the workplace and to communication. Most of us have certain patterns that we are used to and certain ways of responding, and if you believe that there is untapped upside that whatever you are at is kind of a local maximum and that there's better out there, then that's where switching things up could be useful and not just doing everything that you've been doing and getting the same result that you might be getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
This resonates with Toby Lutke when he is doing the podcast, talked about how... He had this quote that I love that just "No human in history has come anywhere near their potential and everyone is way, way, way better than they think are," and these are really cool tactics and really effective ways to actually get closer to your potential. Okay. Two more things I want to talk about real quick. One is your advice on delegating, but also continuing to have high standards. This is something I spent a lot of time on because a lot of people don't delegate because they're afraid it's not going to be as great. I just want this to be really good. I don't trust that it's going to go as well. If I did it my way, it'd be great. So just advice on how to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards.

Wes Kao (01:10:04):
Yeah. I have a framework called CEDAF. C-E-D-A-F.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:08):
Mm-hmm. I love all these acronyms.

Wes Kao (01:10:09):
It's kind of like Cedar, but with an F at the end. I need acronyms for myself. All of these are really reminders for myself because I need a short way to remind myself. So CEDAF stands for the C is comprehension. So have I given this person that I'm delegating to everything that they need to understand what it is that I want them to do. That includes more simple things like logins to all the right software tools that they need to look up, whatever you need to look up. And understanding what the end result should look like, right? So that's all under C for comprehension. E is excitement. Am I explaining this in a way that is making this as exciting as it could be? There are a lot of tasks that aren't inherently that exciting, but by explaining the why behind we're doing this or why it's important to the project we're working on, that makes people more likely to understand and be excited about how this fits into everything.

(01:11:06):
So E is for excitement. D is for de-risk. Am I de-risking any obvious risks from delegating this? So usually when I ask clients this, they immediately think of something. They're like, "Oh yeah, I wouldn't want my direct report to spend a ton of time going in the wrong direction, filling out a hundred rows of the spreadsheet if actually it took longer than we expected." Okay, great. If that's a risk, then maybe you have them do 10 rows, see how long it takes, see if we need all the information that they're actually gathering, and then regroup, right? So what's an obvious risk? Another might be I can see this person misunderstanding and thinking I'm looking for this where I'm really looking for that. Okay, perfect. Just tell them, "When I explain this, you might think I mean this, but really I don't want that. I actually want this," right? So just vocalize it. The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to-

Wes Kao (01:12:00):
The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to speak up and make sure we are actually aligned, that they're picking up what I'm putting down? Because you might be explaining a bunch of stuff, but how much are they actually absorbing? You won't ever know if you wrap up your little spiel and then say, "Okay, go off. Come back to me when you're done." So give people a chance to ask questions to see what parts are resonating, what parts they might be a little bit confused on. Usually, when I do this, it's amazing. Because my team member will say, "What did you mean by this part? How does this part fit in?" I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot to mention this thing." Or, "Oh yeah, I didn't even really explain that well." Okay, so let's go into that.

(01:12:42):
And then F is feedback. How can you have the shortest feedback loop possible? I am a huge fan of shorting the feedback loop as much as possible and then shortening it again. So even within that initial conversation where I'm delegating something, instead of waiting a week, what if we waited a day and checked in on the initial direction that person was going? And let's do it even more. What if after I finished explaining, at the end of that conversation, we brainstormed a couple things that, that person wants to do? So within this same conversation, I'm delegating, I'm already getting a sense of, where do you want to go with this? Once you start, do you see any bottlenecks?

(01:13:24):
And so just really keeping that feedback loop super tight. I found that when I run through the CDAP acronym, there's usually one letter that I could amp up a little bit more like, oh, I didn't really put much thought into making this exciting for the person. How can I connect this to their career goals or to the company's priorities this quarter or to something else? So it's a nice mental checklist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
So much of your advice comes back to this idea that we've touched on a couple of times. We just spend a little bit more time upfront. Is that how you described it, a little more time upfront?

Wes Kao (01:13:56):
Yeah, a little bit more time. A little bit more of an investment upfront.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
Upfront to save you tons of time later. Okay. So as you described this, I don't know if you're realizing this, but you're basically just helping people work better with AI and agents. This framework is exactly I think what people need to effectively delegate to this future world of this agent world of society of agents doing work for us. Basically, you're going to be delegating to these agents in the future, and this framework is a really cool way to frame it. So think about it. Am I communicating this well, comprehension? So CDAP. Comprehension is, again, can I make this clear? Is that the way to think about that?

Wes Kao (01:14:41):
Yeah. Can I make this clear? Does this person have everything they need to be able to accomplish what I am asking them to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):
Okay. And then it's communicate why you're excited about this, basically the why. And it's interesting, there's this funny prompt technique I've learned, prompting engineering technique of just telling the AI, "This is very important to my job." Just using that sentence, it does it better.

Wes Kao (01:14:47):
Oh, interesting, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:04):
It takes it more seriously. It's just so weird. I have a post about this, and that's one of the pieces of advice, just tell me why this is important. I think people take it to the extreme as someone will die if you don't get this right. That actually works.

Wes Kao (01:15:16):
That is extreme. Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
It's wild. Okay, so CEDF, comprehension, excited, de-risk, think about ways you can de-risk, which is moot, basically. What's the most? It's a similar concept. Just think ahead to what might go wrong. Make sure you're aligned, which is quite important in the AI space. Make sure you're aligned. And feedback, get a quick feedback cycle. And it's interesting with deep research on some of these AI tools now, it's like, "I'm off for half an hour. See you." And I imagine more and more of them will check in with you as it's going and ask you questions. I used deep research recently and it's really good at just like, okay, let me have five questions for you before I go off and do this work just to clarify what you want.

Wes Kao (01:15:58):
Yeah, I found that AI will often shorten the feedback loop and align with you as well. When you prompt it, when it comes back, it will not do the entire task for me, sometimes. It'll say, "I've done the first part of this. Does this sound right? Is this what you're looking for? If so, I will complete the next section." And then sometimes I'm like, "Do the whole thing. Just stop trying to conserve energy and just do. I want you to do the whole thing." But that's what it's doing, it's breaking it into smaller chunks to de-risk that it's going to use all this bandwidth to process this thing and I'm going to say, "Oh, that's not what I was looking for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
I'm going to come back to AI real quick, but before I do that, I have one more question for you, but let me just say, I feel like we've discovered an AI version of your course now. Basically, how to delegate well to AI agents that I think people are going to find really valuable, planting a seed. Okay. Before we get back to AI, you have this other concept that I love that I actually learned from you years ago when I was working on my course called the swipe file. Swipe file, what is a swipe file? What is that about? What can it help you with? Why should people be doing this?

Wes Kao (01:17:03):
Yeah. So swipe files are really common for marketers, and I think other functions haven't caught on as much, but I think it is really, really useful. And basically a swipe file is collecting inspiration that you can refer back to later on. So some marketers will collect examples of copy, landing pages, ads, et cetera. For me, I have a file, an Apple Notes, file called Smart Things People Have Said, where I will basically paste in phrases, words, things people have said that I thought were well articulated or sounded really intelligent or sounded strategic. And I don't actually go back and look through my swipe file very often, I think other people do, but for me, even the act of adding it to my swipe file, I've already gotten value from it because it's training me to be more alert to noticing when something is working well.

(01:18:01):
I think there's so much happening around us all the time that your coworker says something smart and you're like, "Oh, that was nice," and then you keep moving on. But when you stop and pause and think, oh, that was really effective, let me add it to my file, and also think about, why was that effective and is that something I can borrow? So in my course, I encourage folks to create a work journal where they can jot down some of these observations, some of these phrases, and basically encourage yourself to be more alert to things you can borrow from other people all around you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Something else about the swipe file, you use quotes. It could be screenshots of cool designs. It could be strategy docs you found to be really effective. It could be conversion flows that are really cool. It could be just whatever you're interested in.

Wes Kao (01:18:52):
Yeah. And the great thing about that is you can then go back and analyze it and break down the structure, break down the argument, break down why was this so effective? Whereas if you're not capturing it, it's easy to just move on to the next thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Yeah, cool. And I did this for a while. I stopped, to be honest, but I really want to be doing this. So this is maybe some homework or something, because I know a lot of people stick with it, is just start like a folder or a Notes, note, whatever you use for your note-taking, and just start throwing stuff in there. And it could be messy, right? It's just like, throw it in.

Wes Kao (01:19:27):
It can be super messy. I was going to say, my back end system is super messy and it's fine. It's not a problem I need to be solving. It works. I find things I need to find. So I like having as simple of a process as possible. So Apple Notes, I open it. It's just on my home screen, I just add something. I'm not tagging anything, I'm not putting it in certain rows and filling information out. I'm just including it in a file, and if I want to go back and look at it, it served its purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:58):
Awesome. Okay, so last question. AI, I'm going to just come back to this briefly. We have this segment on the podcast called AI Corner, and we touched on this already, but I'm just curious how you have found AI to be useful in your work or your life, whether it's helped you become a better communicator? Is there anything you can share that might be helpful to folks?

Wes Kao (01:20:18):
Yeah. I love Claude. There are days when I talk to Claude for three or four hours prompting as a thought partner. So yeah, I think that AI is really helpful for an initial draft of something to bounce off of. Sometimes I'll paste in an email that I am not quite sure how to respond to and ask Claude, "Tell me draft reply." And I'll usually give it some direction. So I found that sharing my point of view makes the output way better. If I just give it something and say, "What would you say?" It's just not as good. Whereas if I say, "I am not sure about how to tell this person no, because I previously said yes and so I feel on the hook, but history has changed and so is there a nice way where I can be really respectful of our relationship and also make them feel seen and heard, but decline?"

(01:21:19):
So if I explain, "That's the problem I'm dealing with and here's what I would ideally like to be able to do," Claude comes back to something that's pretty good. And then from there I'll edit it to my voice because usually it's a little bit too formal sounding. And so I'll make some edits and then I'll share it back to Claude and say, "What do you think of this version? Would you make any improvements?" And then we go back and forth from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:41):
Wes, this is the most useful thing I've ever heard.

Wes Kao (01:21:44):
[inaudible 01:21:44].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:45):
I need this and I need this immediately, just nice ways to say no to stuff. This needs to be an extension that I can have in my browser, just, "Help me say no to this, please." Wow, such a great idea. Okay, good one. Okay, great. Wes, is there anything else? We've gone through a lot. I imagine the answer is no, but before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Wes Kao (01:22:11):
No, I feel like we covered a bunch of great frameworks, principles, so lots for folks to get started.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
All the things. And I love that so much of this will apply to being more effective with AI tools and I feel like people can go through this again and just through that lens of, how will this helped me get more out of Claude and ChatGPT? I bet so much of this will actually apply and I feel like there's an interesting course there. With that, Wes, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Wes Kao (01:22:39):
All right,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Are you ready?

Wes Kao (01:22:41):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Okay. First question, what are a couple books that you recommend most to other people?

Wes Kao (01:22:46):
One is High Output Management by Andy Grove, which is a classic. Another one is Your Brain At Work by Dr. David Rock. And that one is all about better understanding your own brain and attention span so that you can allocate your mental resources appropriately. So that one's great. Ever since reading that, I hide my phone from view because there have been studies that show that even seeing your phone in the corner of your eye, it's distracting. And I do the hardest things earlier in the day when you have more cognitive resources available. So that one's really good. Yeah, those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
These are great. I completely get that phone thing. I'm just looking at my phone, I'm like, "Dang, get out of here. Just go away."

Wes Kao (01:23:36):
I will stick it under my pillow on the couch or hide it under a notebook. It's huge. I'm always hiding my phone so it's not in my line of sight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:47):
I think Arianna Huffington has a product you can buy that's a little bed for your phone that you put to bed before you go to bed in a different room and it has a charger attached.

Wes Kao (01:23:54):
Oh, that's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:55):
So cute, so cute.

Wes Kao (01:23:57):
I don't know if I need a separate bed for my phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:01):
But it's like a ritual, I guess, and there's some theory behind it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Wes Kao (01:24:08):
I love Anything by Harlan Coben on Netflix. Basically, I don't even remember any specific movies or a TV series, but anything he puts out, he's an author and then they've turned a lot of his books into mystery thriller TV series, and anything he puts out becomes number one on Netflix. And I appreciate that he gives the people what they want, that he knows his craft, he knows his genre. And yeah, he just has so many bangers. And I don't remember any specific one, but if it's a Harlan Coben show, I know it's going to be good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:46):
I'm looking at a list now I just Googled real quick. So it's all scary stuff, right?

Wes Kao (01:24:49):
Yeah, they're mystery thrillers, and I think he does a good job playing with time and revealing information over time. It's usually something about someone's past that is now coming to haunt them, and so he'll skip between present day to the past and then slowly reveal stuff. And there's always a twist at the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:11):
There's a page, the Harlan Coben Collection on Netflix. That we'll link to that has all this stuff. I've never heard of this, so this is great. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Wes Kao (01:25:22):
I recently started using an electric toothbrush and it's been life-changing. So my husband got one and then a couple weeks later he gifted me one, and I was like, "Wow, this is actually really nice."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:34):
Are you a Sonicare person, Oral-B person, or something else?

Wes Kao (01:25:37):
It's Oral-B but I've not tried any other brand. That was one that our dentist gifted my husband this electric toothbrush because he did Invisalign. And I'm sure Invisalign is every dentist's dream.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:51):
Margins.

Wes Kao (01:25:52):
I feel like every time I get a cleaning, the dentist is like, "So have you thought about, are you interested in Invisalign?" I'm like, "No." And so when they get a yes, I'm sure they're really excited, and then they lock you in, the brand locks you in with these replacement toothbrush heads that are way more expensive than they should be. So it's a whole razor and blades, ink cartridge and printer model here. So I was horrified by how expensive these replacement heads were.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:18):
But you got a free toothbrush. I think the Oral-B is what I use, but I think that's what the Wirecutter recommended, but it's so loud. I don't know. One of them is just really loud. I think it's the Oral-B, but it's better, apparently. I went with Wirecutter, but it's so loud. I feel like there needs to be a Wirecutter for good design and experience...

Wes Kao (01:26:37):
Ooh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:37):
... versus just the optimal efficient version. Anyway, let's keep going. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you repeat yourself and share with folks?

Wes Kao (01:26:51):
Yes. I actually have many, but I'll share two. One is everything takes longer than you think. So this applies whether you are calling customer support for something or running an errand or building your career, building skills. I find it's useful to add buffers for yourself. This applies for launches too. Just assume it will take longer than you think and you'll be less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That connects to everything we've been talking about. Just spend a little more time upfront to make it. And maybe if you spend more time front, it'll take less time than you think.

Wes Kao (01:27:25):
The other one is a riff on always be closing, like Glengarry Ross. "It's always be selling." This does not mean pawning your wares, but rather putting forth effort into convincing the other person of whatever your recommendation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):
Love them. Okay, final question. So you've been a long time, I hate this word operator, but I guess that's the way people describe this, where you've just been working at companies, building companies, and you recently left that just to become creative person. Started a course on Maven. You do executive coaching, things like that. Any just lessons or a lesson from that jump that might be helpful to folks that are maybe thinking about that?

Wes Kao (01:28:07):
I think when you are an in-house operator, there's a lot about your role that you have a little bit less control over, basically. There's just certain things you have to do because it comes with the territory. Whereas when you are a solo operator running your own business, doing your own thing, you have a lot of freedom to craft your work around only your strengths, only the part that you are really good at, that adds a lot of value for other people where there's market demand. And so, for me, there was a bit of a shift where when I realized that I could craft my business, my work around only the part that I'm best at, and that can be a narrow-ass slice, that's actually really, really freeing.

(01:28:54):
And so I would encourage folks to think about, what is the thing that you are extremely good at that people find super valuable, the part that you love doing most, if you could not do all the other stuff you don't want to do, and how can you think about doubling down on that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:12):
That's such an important point. And the Claude tip you shared of how to say no well is such an important ingredient into that, because so many things come at you and are interesting and enticing that it's hard to decline, that you realize, why the hell am I doing this? I can actually control where I spend time and why did I say yes to this?

Wes Kao (01:29:33):
I actually credit you with helping me come to this realization. I mentioned you on a podcast the other day about this because, do you remember when Maven was launching an important feature, I think it was our marketplace or something, and I had asked you if you wanted to go on Clubhouse to be part of the launch?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
I remember that, but I am sure I said no.

Wes Kao (01:29:59):
Okay, yeah. You said no. You said no. And I was like, "Wow. Out of curiosity, what's the thought behind it?" And you said, I'm going to bastardize this, you could correct me, but you essentially said, "I don't really like doing live public speaking type things and I've been fortunate enough to build a career where I can write, I do my podcasts, and work only on the part that I love doing. And so I'm okay saying no to these other really interesting opportunities." And I remember at that time thinking it was so groundbreaking that you could say no to something that was legitimately a cool opportunity and be really confident about it because it wasn't your core competency. It wasn't the thing you are best at. And I've really kept that in mind when opportunities come my way of, am I excited about this? Is this what I'm really good at? Can I shine in this setting? Because when you are solo, you get to choose the settings that you want to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):
That's such a cool story. I don't exactly remember that, but I am zero surprised at what I said. And the way I put it now, when folks invite me to stuff like this is I just find the ROI on my time is so not worth doing a talk, doing a fireside thing, doing another podcast. It's just like, if I can spend more time on this newsletter than the podcast, the leverage is so much higher than just doing a talk because that takes so much time. So I just have this template now that basically says what I sent you, that is, that it helps. But it's tough. It's so hard to say no. Sometimes these opportunities are so interesting and the person is like, "Wait, what?"

(01:31:37):
Because I don't think the people asking you for stuff know that I'm getting 10 of them a day, and they're like, "Oh, he said no to my talk. He doesn't want to be on my podcast. What a jerk." That's what I think. I don't know if that's what they think. But anyway. Okay, that's great. Yes, and I think I just had a post about reaching a million subscribers to the newsletter, and actually had this image of the Ikigai concept, which is exactly what you just described, which is you want to try to find the thing that you love doing, that people value, and that you can make money doing. That's the dream. And that's exactly what you have done as well. So thank you for being here, Wes. I actually think we delivered on what I thought we would. I think this is going to be one of the most highest leverage conversations we've had.

(01:32:21):
So two final questions. Where can folks find your course? I know you also do executive coaching. Where can folks learn more? And final question is just, how can folks be useful to you, Wes?

Wes Kao (01:32:33):
You can find out more at weskao.com. I linked my course to my coaching from my main page. I also post on LinkedIn as well, so you can follow me there. And I'm always looking to meet fellow operators who out about communication. So if you put any of these principles into practice, I would love to hear about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:53):
Awesome. We'll do that in the comments. They can DM you. I don't know, what's the best way to reach you on the website or Twitter?

Wes Kao (01:32:59):
Yeah, bunch of platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:02):
All the places. Okay, cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:04):
Website, email, LinkedIn, DM me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:05):
There we go. There we go. Wes, thank you so much for being here.

Wes Kao (01:33:08):
Yeah, thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:09):

## Transcript

Wes Kao (00:00:00):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy. I'm a big proponent of asking myself, if I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing? How could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach in writing. Any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:00:35):
I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. If you are just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people, and it's confusing, you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You have an awesome framework called MOO.

Wes Kao (00:00:54):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. A lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get especially in meetings, we feel blindsided. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. Are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):
Today my guest is Wes Kao. Wes co-created the Alt-MBA program with Seth Godin. She Co-Founded a company called Maven, which I often collaborate with, which makes it easy for people to host live cohort-based courses. She recently left Maven to launch her own course on Executive Communication and Influence. There's a quote that came to mind after I stopped recording this conversation with Wes by George Bernard Shaw, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

(00:01:51):
By the end of this podcast if you listen to what Wes suggests, you'll be a lot closer to becoming a world-class communicator.

With that, I bring you Wes Kao.

(00:02:18):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

Wes Kao (00:04:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm very honored to be a second-time guest.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
Very rare honor. No pressure, but I think this is going to be one of the highest leverage episodes I've done and let me tell you why I think that's the case in the newsletter and on the podcast, I often talk about just how important and how high leverage the skill of communication is to product leaders, to leaders, just to people in general. There's this quote that Boz, the CTO of Meta, he's been on the podcast, he wrote this famous blog post, "Communication is the job." And I think that's true for product people, but it's true for basically any sort of leadership role. Anyone trying to get ahead. And you are one of the best communicators I've ever met. You are one of the best teachers of communication I've ever come across. You have one of the most popular courses on Maven, on executive communication, so I'm really excited to have you here and to help people become better communicators, better at influence and all these things. So thank you again for being here.

Wes Kao (00:05:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
Okay. So something that I often do with guests on the podcast, not even often, always, I ping people that the guests have worked with and ask them, "What should I ask Wes? What should I know about Wes?" Let me read a few quotes about you in regards to your communication skills from folks that have worked with you-

Wes Kao (00:05:34):
All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
And these are three different people. Okay, so first, "Wes single handedly raised the quality of the entire company's writing by like two X across the board. I always say the best writing course I ever took was working with Wes for a year."

Wes Kao (00:06:07):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:09):
Okay. That's one.

Wes Kao (00:06:10):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:10):
"Wes never just throws things out there, she's precise with her use of language, meticulous about examining her own ideas before bringing them in front of others and knows how to make her points in a way that people will understand them and buy into them." Okay. And third, "Wes includes a reasoning with every proposal in the context behind all of her recommendations so that everyone around her learns in order of magnitude faster. This also makes her an exceptional teacher because she can clearly define what excellence is and why something is the goal, and then break down the steps and principles involved." Okay, reactions.

Wes Kao (00:06:46):
Those are really nice things. That's amazing. Yeah, thank you so much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
And these are people across different companies, so.

Wes Kao (00:06:52):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Okay, so that was just to highlight of how good you are at this stuff. And what we're going to be doing with our chat is going through a bunch of your tactics that you teach and that have helped people become better communicators, executive communicators, better at influence. Before we get into the specific tactics, is there anything that you think is important for people to understand just broadly around the skill of becoming a better communicator?

Wes Kao (00:07:17):
I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy, there's a lot of avoidable questions, and I'm a big proponent of asking myself, "If I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing to that?" So, you know, instead of blaming other people for not understanding me, I think about how could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have? So I'm a big proponent of agency. And realizing that we can only control our own behavior. And so the best place to start, if you're not getting the reaction you're looking for, is reflecting on how can I get better at the skill of communicating? And it absolutely is a skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
So what I'm hearing is if you're having a hard time people buying into what you're trying to convince them to do or you're finding people are doing not what you asked them to do, it's likely an issue with your ability to communicate, it's probably not their fault.

Wes Kao (00:08:28):
Yeah, I would say so. You can't solve everything with improving your communication, but you can increase the likelihood of getting what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
Cool. Okay. Anything else along these lines of just things that are important to understand just broadly around communication, executive communication?

Wes Kao (00:08:46):
I think another big one that I teach in my course and really kick off with is practicing like it's game day, playing like it's game day. So I see a lot of operators who save their best behavior for executives only. So you know, they want to shine when they're presenting to senior leadership, but with everyone else, they're kind of calling it. And I just don't think that you're going to be able to get enough reps to actually get good at executive communication if you are only doing it with executives. Because many of us only present to execs once a month, right? Or a couple of times a quarter. And that's just not a lot of chance to practice. So really treating every single stakeholder as if they are important because they are, and you shouldn't be if you don't want to waste your CEO's time, you also shouldn't waste your cross-functional team members' time or your manager's time or your direct reports' time. So that's something else that I ask to keep in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
And maybe a last question before we get into the tactics. When people think communication, they think email, they think meeting presentations, things like that. How do you think about, when you talk about executive communication and communication in general, what's kind of the umbrella of things that includes?

Wes Kao (00:09:53):
Yeah, I would say broadly the two mediums are verbal communication and written. So verbal being meetings, conversations, presentations. And written being emails, strategy docs, notion docs, Slack messages, text messages, those two categories broadly. And I also think about communication as more of a means to an end, which might be interesting for some people because I teach a course on communication. So you would think that's like the end in and of itself, but I really see it as a means to an end where the end is getting the ideal outcome you're looking for. So whether that is buy-in or making a good decision as a team or moving to the next step, whatever that might be, communication is really in service of that end goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:43):
Awesome. Okay. So I made a list of people's favorite tactics and frameworks and approaches that you teach, and talking to folks that you've taught and folks that you've worked with. So I'm just going to go through a bunch and let's just help people get better at these things.

Wes Kao (00:10:58):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):
Okay. So the first is something you call sales, then logistics. What is that about?

Wes Kao (00:11:07):
Yes. So a common mistake that I see is overestimating the amount of buy-in that you have from your audience. So that looks like jumping straight into talking about the logistics, the details of the how to do something, of the process. When in reality your audience has not yet decided if they even want to do the thing. So what I see operators do in response then is go even deeper into the logistics and the how, thinking that, "Oh, if I just explain this more than that person will want to do it." When really a sales note is different than a logistics note. A sales note is meant to get people excited to do the thing you want them to do, and to agree to do it. And only then after they have bought in, does it make sense to share the logistics.

(00:11:57):
So there's an order of operations here. If you switch the order of operations, you will likely get a slow response or just no response, right? We've all put a Slack message in a channel and got crickets and tumbleweed. So really starting off with selling the person and making sure that they know why we're doing this, why this matters to the company, why now, and then sharing the logistics tends to be a lot more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Is there an example of that that might help illustrate that point or that approach?

Wes Kao (00:12:27):
Yeah. So one of my clients is a head of operations and she was trying to get the rest of her executive team, which she was a part of, to fill in some wins for the week so that they could share this out with the whole company. And this was going to be motivating, it was going to shine a light on folks. And she led with the logistics of which document to send, to put the details in, what time to put it in by, the format that you should put these wins and didn't really get much of a response from the leadership team, which makes sense, right? Because this totally sounds like one of those things that's another item to check off on your list when you already have so many other things to do and here's this other process that like we're all supposed to do now, like yay, right? And so she wasn't really getting response. And that's because she dove straight into logistics.

(00:13:20):
Whereas what she could have done is start by selling folks, selling the other executives on why are we doing this? Well, we're doing this because this is a chance to shine a light on your team members who are doing amazing work, for them to feel motivated and to feel like the rest of the company really sees them and understands what they're doing. And this is all something that is going to motivate your team, right? So sharing why this is helpful and useful and how this is in service of you and your team versus like, "Oh, this is a favor that you're doing for me to fill out this form and fill it out this way and by this date," et cetera, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
I know that execs often want the opposite where they're just like, "Okay, I know, just tell me what you want to do. Just like, okay, just get to the point. I don't want time for all this context and background." Any advice on when to spend any time on the sales? Like what are signs that, okay, maybe you don't have them sold yet, or what are maybe contexts where you should probably still try to sell them first?

Wes Kao (00:14:20):
Yeah. So I actually think that you should always do a little bit of selling even for situations where people have generally bought in. Because most of us have a lot going on and we're not actively thinking about whatever you're talking about. So even though I agreed to something two weeks ago, by the time you're telling me about it again, like I thought about a billion other things since then, right? So reminding me of why are we talking about this? Why does this matter? And then getting into it and framing that conversation upfront is way more likely for us to not get stuck in a cold start and not kind of go two steps back one step forward.

(00:14:55):
The other thing is, you can frame a conversation and sell a bit at the beginning very concisely. So I'm not talking about spending 15 minutes out of a 30 minute meeting selling, I'm talking about one to two minutes, even a couple sentences, and then transitioning into the main thing you want to talk about. So I'm a huge proponent of doing that and basically reminding people, why are we doing this? Why are we here today? Why does this matter? And then getting into the meat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:24):
I love that. So basically you can do this really briefly, it doesn't have to be a whole pitch for half an hour. It's just a reminder, "Here's why we think this is important." And I think that's such a good point because a lot of times it's like a leader is looking at this thing you're asking them to do and they're like, "Why are we even, why am I spending time on this?" And just a reminder of like, "Okay, I see, I forgot this was going to be, this a part of our strategy, this has this much impact potential or here's how it could help our team be more efficient."

Wes Kao (00:15:52):
Yeah. And you can really do that in like 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
Is there like a, I don't know, structure to this? Is it just like why? Is there a kind of a template you like or some way you recommend of selling first? Is it like, "Here's why we're doing this." Starting like that? Anything along those lines?

Wes Kao (00:16:09):
Yeah. I think explaining why we're doing this, why this benefits the business, what problem this is solving. Again, you can do a lot of this in a couple of sentences. And then I also like asking or stating what I need from the other person upfront. So saying, "Hey, we're here today because two weeks ago we were reviewing the product flow and realized that there were a couple of parts that were kind of confusing. So I took a stab at fixing those areas, rewriting the microcopy, and I want to present them to you today, see if you agree with these changes, and then we're going to roll them out. What I'm looking for from you is feedback on the changes and if you agree." So like that was like 15 seconds, right? Super fast. And then now we're all on the same page about why we're here. And you can listen more intently knowing that I'm looking for a certain kind of feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
I would love to hear it that way. I think there's like an implication here that maybe is worth sharing of just, a lot of this is about communicating effectively to execs, which will make you communicate better to most people. But especially with folks up the ladder. They don't have a lot of time, they have a million things in their head. Maybe just share like why this is so important, like what the state of mind of a leader is that you need to kind of break through.

Wes Kao (00:17:25):
Yeah. So I call it the yes, yes, yes, next, next, next mindset where if I'm listening to direct reports present something to me, very often I find myself thinking, "Got it. All right, yes, let's keep going." Right? And you know, on the other side of that, I've often presented to executives where I had a 15 slide deck and execs would do that and I'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like I have a whole sequence, I have a whole order, you know? And sometimes they would give me buy or make the decision by slide four, you know? And I'd be like, "Okay, well you know, slide 13, I want to show you this great graph I put together." Right? And what was really helpful for me was realizing that I should take the win. Okay, if five seconds already agreed, take the win and keep it moving, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):
Yeah. What's that quote like? "If you've sold them, stop talking."

Wes Kao (00:18:16):
Right. Yes. Yeah, you might talk them out of agreeing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):
Yeah. Okay. You mentioned being concise. Let's talk about that. You have some really good advice on just how to effectively be concise and not too concise. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:18:31):
Yes. One of my pet peeves is when people are too concise and they equate being concise with brief, being brief. And being concise is not about absolute word count, it's about economy of words. It's about the density of the insight that you're sharing. And so you can have a 300 word memo that's meandering and long-winded and a thousand word memo that is tight and concise. And so not equating concision with briefness I think is a really big one to understand.

(00:19:05):
The second thing is a lot of advice about being concise, I think misses an important point. So we've all heard, "Don't bury the lead, cut to the chase." Main point, put the main point at the top, bottom line up front, right? And all of these pithy aphorisms assume that you actually know what your core point is. So you can't cut to the chase unless you know what the chase is. You can't unbury the lead unless you know what the lead is. And so that I found is the bottleneck to being concise. It's actually not really being clear of what you are thinking, that's what's leading to being long-winded.

(00:19:49):
And you can kind of test this theory because most of us have a go-to story that we've told a bunch of times, right? We're like, you know exactly when people are going to laugh, you know when they're going to gasp or hold their breath, right? And why are you so good at telling that story and why are you so concise about it? Because you've told it a bunch of times, you know all of the beats. So in meetings though, at work, we are very rarely talking about the same thing that many times it's always something new. It's something that we are also probably likely processing ourselves and are in the midst of processing as we are in a quick turnaround time, telling someone else about it, telling our team about it. And so you are basically asking your brain to do a lot of different processes, especially in a real time conversation. You're listening to the other person absorbing, making sense of it, processing it, figuring out what you think and how you would react.

(00:20:39):
And then trying to say something cohesive that makes sense, right? And then trying to be concise about it. So it's just a lot of different processes. And so the only solution I found consistently to being concise is preparation. It's not a very glamorous solution by any means, but the clearer I am going into a meeting, going into a conversation, going into a pitch, the better I am at being concise and being able to bring the conversation back to the most important points at being able to stay flexible, but also firm and preparation. I don't mean spending hours and hours preparing for a weekly meeting, even a couple of minutes really makes a huge difference.

(00:21:25):
Most of us are so back to back in meetings that we're doing zero preparation. It's like the meeting has started 30 seconds in and you're still unwinding from the last Zoom call that you were on, right? So most of us are in that mental state. So if you even take 30 seconds to one minute to ground yourself on why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across in the time that we have, you're going to go in there so much more focused and so much more able to be concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
So the advice there, so this is for meetings and I want to talk about writing also, but for meetings, the advice here is before you get into a meeting, actually think about why am I in this meeting? What do I want to get out of it? Instead of in the meeting figuring out a lot as you go, which to your point, you're just going to ramble and be like, "Oh, okay, here's what I actually want to say."

Wes Kao (00:22:10):
Yeah. And what might I want to share in the meeting too? You know, especially for more introverted folks. Sometimes you need to decide beforehand that you want to speak and you want to make sure you get a certain point across. So even deciding that beforehand makes a huge difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:25):
Yeah, I found this extremely powerful just like five minutes before you get into a meeting. And it could happen earlier in the day, right? It doesn't have to happen right before the meeting, or worst case, it's right before the meeting. Just, "Okay, what do I want to get out of this? What am I here? What do I want to say?" And just like giving your brain a little bit of time to prepare. Super powerful. In writing, is there like any tactics you can share for someone to be a little more concise?

Wes Kao (00:22:50):
I think the main tactic is to remind yourself to be concise. And usually when I do that, I end up trimming 20% at least of what I wrote, tightening up some sentences. I also ask myself, how might I be adding cognitive load to whatever it is that I'm saying? So is there a tighter, clearer, cleaner way that I can ask what I'm asking or present the information I'm presenting or make the recommendation that I'm making? And usually if you even ask yourself that, your brain automatically comes up with stuff. You just see whatever you wrote differently and you're like, "Oh shit, I could trim this entire paragraph because that's secondary." And maybe you have your primary message in Slack, and then within the thread add some of the secondary stuff, right? So I find that most of us, it's reminding yourself to be concise. And once you think of it, your brain naturally will see places where you can trim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
There's a layer of advice under this that you're not saying that I'm going to say, which is actually look at the thing you wrote at least once before you share it. Because I used to be really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. I wrote this doc, send it, get feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
... really bad at this. I just like, "Okay, I don't have time. We wrote this doc, send it, get feedback. All right. Send this email. I don't have time to read this email." And I find just forcing yourself to look at it solves so much of this.

Wes Kao (00:24:10):
Oh, yes, yes, definitely. I was assuming before doing that, but you're right, some people might not be. And yes, definitely reading your own message first is huge. And yeah, I find that even doing that you can often spot a lot of low-hanging fruit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Right. You'll find the typos and grammar issues and you'll be like, "Oh, I don't need this word." Along those lines, let me share two books. People always ask me, "How did you learn to write?" I'm like, "I'm not a writer, I don't know what I'm doing." But two books really helped me write more effectively. And one is specifically to help you write more concisely called On Writing Well. I don't know if you've read that.

Wes Kao (00:24:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Okay. And it's basically chapter after chapter of, "Here's what you can cut. And you can cut more. And look what more you can cut and cut this stuff." And he has screenshots of essays that students have written in his class and he's like, "Look at all those words you cut and nothing has changed. It's exactly the same message and even is better with 40% of the words cut."

Wes Kao (00:25:12):
Is this by Sol Stein or another author?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):
I don't have it... It's somewhere in my bookshelf. So we'll look it up.

Wes Kao (00:25:19):
Yeah, there's a writing book by Sol Stein that I absolutely love. And I feel like it might be called On Writing Well, but then also I could see there being multiple books called On Writing Well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
There's also Writing Well I think by Stephen King, that's another one that people love, but there On Writing Well is the one I really loved because it's very tactical.

Wes Kao (00:25:37):
Going back to something that you were saying earlier with rereading what you wrote, I think the blast radius of a poorly written memo is way bigger than most people think. So if you're just shooting off a message in a Slack channel with 15 other people and it's confusing and you didn't include information you should have included, there's going to be a bunch of back and forth. All 15 of these people are reading this being like, "Okay, what do I do with this?"

(00:26:05):
Whereas if you had just taken another look at it, those 15 people would be off to the races. They would've read your message and then known exactly what to do next or what their part was or what you were looking for from them. So I think about that a lot too. It's not just me writing this and sending it off. It's, "Who are all the people who are going to come in contact with this message who are going to refer to it and use it? And if I just take 30 more seconds to make sure that it's clean, how much can I unblock from their work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:34):
That's such a good point. I like that, I love that term blast radius. It's such a good point. Just like there's so much negative leverage in writing inefficiently and inconcisely. If you spend like... Inconcisely? I don't know the word is there, but if you just spend three minutes spending a little more time making it more clear just like the impact and leverage that has, that's such a good point. I looked up the books, it's so funny. Okay, so there's On Writing Well by William Zinsser. There's Stein On Writing by Sol Stein, which is what you said you were talking about. And then Stephen King has a book called On Writing. Everyone's got the same.

Wes Kao (00:27:09):
Yeah. Common title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:12):
Not ideal for SEO but On Writing Well is the one that I love by William Zinsser. There's also one called A Series Of Short Sentences if you haven't seen that one. It's a really good rate too. It's just how to write short sentences and just the power of just keeping sentences short, which I struggle with.

Wes Kao (00:27:27):
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:28):
Okay. Back to our agenda. There's another framework/tactic that I've heard you recommend. It's called signposting. What is signposting?

Wes Kao (00:27:38):
Signposting is using certain words, phrases, formatting, and an overall structure in your writing that helps guide your reader and signals what is coming in the rest of the post. So, this is especially helpful if you have a long memo. It adds structure to where are we going and what certain sections of paragraphs are about. So some of my favorite signposting words are, "for example," shows that you're about to show an example because shows that you're about to share your logic and rationale behind something. "As a next step," is a great one. People's eyes automatically zoom to, "as a next step." Even "First, second, third," kicking off a paragraph with that, you're not needing to rely on rich text formatting with bolding, italics, underlines and all that craziness. If you kick off sentences with signposting words, you can often signal, "Here's what I'm about to talk about in this paragraph."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
These are power words for clarity. There's this whole concept of power words like, "free."

Wes Kao (00:28:47):
Yeah. "A gift."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
"Gift." Yeah. For copywriting and these are basically power words for helping your brain see the structure and get to the thing you want to pay attention to. So I'll read back the words you just used. "For example," " because," "as a next step," and then, "first, second, third."

Wes Kao (00:29:05):
Yeah. Yeah. You can use signposting in writing and verbally too. So if you're doing a product demo, you might say something like, "The most important part to pay attention to is, blank." Or, "The part that we were most surprised by is, blank." Or, "The part that customers are," et cetera. Right? So it's, you're signaling that whatever comes after this thing is something that you may want to pay attention to. So it's a great way not only to add structure, but to also grab people's attention back if it has strayed some time as they were either listening to you or reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:42):
Along those lines, I find I find formatting really helpful here, just bold and bullets. I know you have a pet peeve with too much formatting. How much is too much formatting?

Wes Kao (00:29:51):
I really hate excessive formatting. So, I've seen memos where 30% of the note was bolded. And that just negates the entire point of bolding because if everything is bolded then nothing is being highlighted, right? So I think using formatting in general more sparingly than you think you have to is probably a good rule of thumb. I also dislike when people overuse bullets and sentence fragments, phrases in bullets when they should use complete sentences that actually show the connected tissue between ideas, that show the logical flow of what it is that you're saying.

(00:30:33):
And it feels faster and more concise to put bullets and fragments, but a lot of times your reader on the other end of that is needing to decipher and interpret and guess what you actually meant. So it net, net takes longer. And I also think that it can be a little bit of a crutch, it can be a little bit lazy because you are telling yourself that you're being concise when really, if you had to turn your sentence fragment into a full sentence, a lot of times it actually is harder than you think because you realize that you actually didn't really know exactly what you meant. So as you're trying to turn it into a full sentence, you're actually needing to use brainpower.

(00:31:15):
So that's I think a great litmus test of, "Was that idea fully thought out?" Because if it was, you should be able to really quickly turn it into a complete sentence. And many times, you actually aren't. So I see people like basically think, "Oh, I want to make this easier to read, more skimmable. I'm just going to throw a bunch of formatting and bullets and turn everything into bullets." And it's not quite that easy of a solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:41):
This is very much along the lines of the whole Amazon six-page memo where Jeff Bezos just realized, "If you can't write it out as a long memo and explain yourself in prose, you don't actually know what you're saying." And it's a really good filter for helping people actually crystallize and know themselves, "Okay, I see. I don't actually know what I'm doing here." And I love this is a microcosm of that. Can you just make a bullet point a real sentence versus a fragment of a sentence?

(00:32:06):
I'm thinking about as a listener being like, "Okay, how do I actually get better at this?" So maybe let's take a tangent. I know that you teach a whole course, you do all this stuff hands-on with people to help them actually build these skills. For someone that hasn't taken the course or isn't taking it, what's a good way to start practicing these skills and know if what you're writing is getting better, is good. Is it find a mentor, find someone that you think is a great writer and have them review stuff? Any tips there?

Wes Kao (00:32:34):
Yeah. So I have a pretty first principles driven approach for this, which is to think about how long does it take me right now to get to the reaction I'm looking for from my recipient? If it takes a bunch of back and forth and a bunch of friction, then that's my baseline. And once you start practicing some of these communication skills, how does that speed up? If you would have had seven different touch points of back and forth, does that shrink to two to three?

(00:33:08):
Not every point of friction is going to be avoidable, but a lot of it is if you get better at communicating. So I like watching for the reaction and how quickly and how enthusiastically I'm able to get that reaction. And for the things that are working, do more of that. For things that are not working, adjust your execution because it might not be that the tactic doesn't work, it might be your execution of it wasn't great. And keep trying, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:35):
So the advice here is just see how well you're writing/meeting/suggestion goes, how well it does. And if it's not like there's the ideal immediately, "Yes, let's do it." And then there's the, "I don't really understand." There's the spectrum of response. And what I'm hearing is just pay attention to if the speed to getting what you want is increasing in general.

Wes Kao (00:33:59):
Yeah, yeah. I don't think that there's any single shortcut on how to get better besides that. I do think that being fascinated by a topic and being excited about it makes it more likely that you're going to find it fun to try all these different things and try different ways to get through to people. So, I would approach it with a hypothesis-driven experimental mindset and almost like a game. Like, "When I do this, how does that other person react? If I frame it this way, do I get a different reaction? When I try this, am I able to cut through the noise more?"

(00:34:39):
Yeah. So I really think it's about practicing. And I will say that the way not to do it is to try to incorporate 30 different tactics at the same time and then beat yourself up when you don't remember to do them. It's really easy when you are learning a new field or function to get overwhelmed when you're learning a new skill. And the way to build a habit is usually not changing so many different things at once. It's picking one thing that you want to try and keeping that top of mind, trying it in a bunch of different settings in different ways. And getting it better at that thing before moving on to the next thing.

(00:35:19):
So that's like a really common thing I see in my course is people feeling overwhelmed. And I always remind folks that, "You are building a new habit here. And be patient with yourself, take it step by step."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:31):
There's a lot of stuff we're talking about here that a lot of people might be like, "This is so minor. What? I just bullet point sentences, be a little... Tell them the why at the beginning."

(00:35:41):
And I just want to share in my experience the biggest jump I made in my career was actually getting better at these very specific skills. I had this manager, Vlad, who's been on the podcast and I talk about him regularly, who was such a stickler about communicating well and being very clear and concise and thinking and just spending more time on documents and emails, on strategy docs. Just like, "No, this isn't ready. Spend more time, here's something that's not clear." And just doing that was such an accelerant for me.

(00:36:12):
And it's all these little things. That's what's interesting about it. It's like everything seems really minor but it all adds up to a lot of impact because to your point, people see it, "Okay, cool, I get it, let's go." Versus like, "I don't like this idea." And then it's like it all falls apart. So I guess any reactions to that?

Wes Kao (00:36:29):
Yeah. All these little things compound and make a big difference. I often hear people think, "Well, this individual instance, this individual email, the Slack message is not worth spending a couple more minutes on. It's just an email or it's just a Slack message." The problem with that line of thinking is that no one instance of something is ever going to feel important enough to spend a little bit more time on that. And then, but when you zoom out, that's like, "Well that's all your work then. This is literally everything you've touched. This is all your work output then." because any piece of that process you thought wasn't worth spending time on and now this is just the quality of your work and it's not as good as it could be.

(00:37:15):
So yes, these might seem minor but A, it compounds. And also B, all the "big things," everyone else is already doing. So, there's not a lot of alpha in that. Whereas if you are paying attention to skills that people think are boring or too basic and realizing that's a lever that you can pull, that someone else thought, "Oh, we're hitting diminishing returns on that. I'm not going to spend more time on that." But you realize that there's actually more juice left to squeeze there and you decide to squeeze that juice. Well, now, you have extra juice that the other person doesn't have.

(00:37:56):
So yeah, in my experience I find that people claim the point of diminishing returns way too early. And this isn't just for communication, this is for strategies, tactics, et cetera. They'll try something once, a mediocre attempt and be like, "This channel doesn't work. This tactic doesn't work." It's like, "Really? Because it's working for a lot of other people who are getting really creative with it."

(00:38:19):
I'm not saying that everything has to work for you but for you to claim, "This thing just doesn't work," feels a little bit intellectually dishonest. It's more likely that your skill level, your creativity, your execution ability was not good enough. And that's fine. Let's admit that to ourselves because if we admit that, then we can do the hard work of getting better at those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
It feels like if you really boil this down, all the advice comes down to just spend a little more time on all these things you're putting out.

Wes Kao (00:38:51):
I like thinking about it as a little bit more upfront investment. And it is an investment. It's not just time. It's an investment because yes, it takes a little bit longer to make a Slack message a little bit better, but net, net if you save a bunch of questions and back and forth and people asking you things that you don't think they should be asking, then by investing a little bit of upfront effort, you've prevented all that from happening. So yeah, it is a little bit more time in the moment but reaps a lot of benefits down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):

(00:40:42):
You mentioned Slack. I have a great quote also about you that I didn't read that I'm just going to read right now from someone that worked with you. She said she searched the Slack channel at the company you worked at for old posts from Wes for inspiration for what to ask you. And she said you had zero half-baked thoughts, 100% complete sentences, perfect punctuation, clear takeaways at the top of every message. It's the kind of thing you don't notice in isolation, but once you see everyone else's messages in a remote-first company, it's a stark contrast.

Wes Kao (00:41:14):
Yeah, thank you. I will also say that as someone who tries to walk the talk, I feel like I get a pretty good response rate pretty quickly for the things that I ask for, for the recommendations I'm making. It's not instant, it's not 100%, but over time I've realized that improving my communication has led to people receiving my ideas better. Ideas that used to be locked in my head that I would get frustrated that no one else understood. People were now understanding and that feels really good. That's very, very exciting and it made me want to do it more and pay more attention to that. So that's going back to what I said earlier about watching for what's working. There's momentum is really encouraging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):
And I totally feel that. If you start getting the things you want, that feels great. I'd be like, "Okay, cool."

Wes Kao (00:42:08):
Yeah, more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
"Let's do more of that." Yeah, and again, it's like very minor things. It's like a couple more minutes on the Slack message, a couple more minutes on email.

Wes Kao (00:42:16):
Very doable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):
Yeah, which everyone can do. There's no magic here, it's just spend a little more time and use some of these tactics that we're talking about. Speaking of that, let me talk about another tactic. Apparently you have some really good advice on finding the right level of confidence in what you're saying. There's always this question of, "I come to this leader. How confident should I be about, 'This is the answer,' versus, 'Here's a bunch of ideas'?" What do you think? What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (00:42:41):
I find that people tend to naturally be on the spectrum a little bit too confident as a baseline or not confident enough. So people who are too confident might state hypotheses as if they are fact. So that really bothers me. That's another one of my pet peeves, where if you say, "This is X," or, "This will X," that is different than saying, "This could X," or, "This might X," or, "This will increase the likelihood of X."

(00:43:12):
So I'm a big proponent of speaking accurately. You can avoid a lot of problems if you speak accurately about your level of conviction and about the actual amount of evidence that you have for something. It's okay for something to be an initial hunch. Say, "It's an initial hunch." Don't act like this is something that you are super sure about. You've proven out that this is absolutely this way because the rest of your team is listening to you at face value. And y'all might spend real headcount and dollars pursuing something that you have advocated for in a way where you overreached with your level of confidence.

(00:43:52):
So, that's for people who are overconfident. It's equally a problem if you're under-confident. So I have some clients who their CEO asked them to share some recommendations with another team because they've run something before and so they share all this amazing information and at the end they're like, "Oh, but you can ignore everything I just said. Obviously, make your own decision. Do what you think is best. And if you want to just ignore everything, that's totally cool too." And it's like you just didn't have to say that. You could say, "Make your own decision, take all this into account," but you don't have to diminish to that degree.

(00:44:31):
And so again, speaking accurately, if you have really strong reasons to recommend something to the cross-functional team, it's almost irresponsible to act like you are not really sure and it's just this random idea, "Hey, try it if you want to." We might lose a lot of money and time if we don't take this idea, right? So again, speaking accurately is so, so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
Is a simple way to think about then the right balance is have a point of view, have a recommendation, present accurate facts, and be clear when you are not? "It's not actually 100% true, but here's a hunch I have, or here's a theory we have."

Wes Kao (00:45:11):
Yeah, I think sharing a point of view, sharing a recommendation, and then backing it up with evidence, with logic, with first principles, with examples, with data, if you have it. Not every situation you're going to have data for, especially if you're building something new. So this is where first principles comes in. Even explaining how you got to where you got to and why you think this is going to work, that all gives your team, your manager, something to push back on, to poke holes on or to align on and say, "Yeah, I agree here, but I disagree on this part."

(00:45:44):
So you can talk about ideas with a lot more specificity when you share your thought process. And you can frame it all kicking off saying, "My initial thinking is," or, "Based on what we know, my hunch is, blank." So speaking accurately and then still bringing up those facts so that we can all make as informed of a decision as we can make given what we know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Advice I got that really helped here for me was to try not to be biased with how you frame everything. You have your suggestion for how to do something. It's easy to just bias all of the data to point in that direction. And if people notice that, they're like, "Oh, okay. Well, I can't really trust this because I see you're just like, you clearly have an agenda." So it's a little bit like having an agenda and a POV, but be clear about what is actually true. Be accurate.

Wes Kao (00:46:36):
Yeah. I think anytime people have to discount what you're saying because you are biased in this way is not great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:45):
Is there an example by any chance that highlights what you're describing here?

Wes Kao (00:46:49):
Yeah, so in my course I talk about not being a single-minded martyr. So single-minded martyr is someone who very much has an agenda, who wants the recommendation to go through and is presenting a bunch of evidence, supporting that direction. And then gets really frustrated when other people are not seeing it or are skeptical. And so one of my clients was a single-minded martyr in a recommendation she was making. So she was on the growth acquisition side of her company. And was having trouble with cross-functional team members lending headcount to her project. And so everyone would say like, " Oh, yes, we believe in this, this is important," but wouldn't want to actually give her half of their engineer for two weeks.

(00:47:36):
And we were talking about it and as we were talking, she revealed that the CEO had at the beginning of the year said that the company-wide goal is retention that year. That their biggest challenges and areas of opportunity were in retention, not necessarily in growth. And once she zoomed out and realized this, she was able to put her recommendation in context. And realized that it's not just-

Wes Kao (00:48:00):
... recommendation in context. And realize that it's not just I'm the only one who cares about this company. Everyone is a hypocrite. They say they believe this, but don't actually want to work on it. Before that was kind of her narrative, but once she zoomed out and realized she was being a single [inaudible 00:48:16], she could better fit her proposal in the context of what else was happening in the organization. I think actually this is a really big difference between more junior people versus more senior people. More junior people are like, "I need to win. I need to get a yes for this proposal and I'm going to keep advocating for it until I get a yes." Whereas really sometimes the best decision for the company is not right now. This doesn't actually fit our priorities right now, right?

(00:48:42):
Or maybe yes, but let's right size the level of investment. So it might look like half whatever the size of what that recommendation actually was, and having the maturity to realize that, to put your idea into context is huge. That took me a really long time to learn and I think that goes under the umbrella of always do what's best for the company, not necessarily what's best for me, my career, my team, my wins. If you prioritize what's best for the company, that helps you have a more right-sized way of still advocating for your ideas, but doing it with a bit more equanimity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
And also just connecting to what the company is. Just this idea of if the thing you're pitching is not aligned with what is important to the company right now, it's unlikely to be prioritized. It makes sense. This is why leaders choose, here's what matters most. We got to do the things that are going to help us drive this thing right now, like retention or revenue. And so that's just, I think, a sub tactic there is just whenever you're pitching something, connect that to the goal of the person you're pitching to so that they're like, "Oh, I see how this is going to help me. That's great. Let's do it. Great advice."

(00:50:01):
And I think this is something a lot of people run into. It's just, "Why aren't they listening to me? Why don't they want... That's such a good idea. They hate me." It's something, "Oh, I bet they hate me. They don't trust me." When it's just like, okay, this isn't a priority right now. Let's come back to it another time. Okay. I'm going to get to a couple more tactics and then I'm going to shift directions to talk about managers and being manager. You have an awesome framework called MOO. What is MOO? What does it stand for and what is it all about?

Wes Kao (00:50:26):
MOO stands for Most Obvious Objection. M-O-O. And the thought there is that a lot of times we're surprised by the questions that we get, especially in meetings where we feel blindsided, that was unexpected, and then we're on our back foot. When really, if you thought for even two minutes about what are obvious objections that I'm likely to get when I share this, you often immediately come up with what some of those things are. So are you going to be able to anticipate every single objection? No. But can you anticipate the obvious ones? Absolutely. And so this is where knowing your own argument in and out, including counterarguments becomes so important. So knowing your counterarguments as well as you know the arguments for doing the thing. When you do that, when you have prepared in that way, you're less likely to feel caught off guard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
When you hear you talk about this, it's like, obviously I shouldn't do this, but very few people actually do this, actually spend a couple minutes, " Okay, here's what I'm going to pitch."

Wes Kao (00:51:31):
Even a couple seconds, really. Really, even a couple seconds, your brain will think of something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:38):
Is there a story or an example of this that you share that highlights this idea of the power of MOO?

Wes Kao (00:51:43):
I use MOO multiple times a day, every day, every single day. Literally whatever I'm about to say I think how might someone disagree with this or what might an objection be? So whatever it is I'm writing, saying, it's a really good mental filter because it encourages you to think a couple steps ahead in kind of a structured way, right? If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me. Well, if I take that into account, I can volunteer that information upfront or I can frame it in a way where they're less likely to think that that's an issue.

(00:52:19):
And so it's muscle memory for me at this point, and this might be something we include at the end is something to start with. But putting MOO on a post-it, Most Obvious Objection, what is someone likely to object about? And then just keeping that top of mind. It's a great way to train yourself to empathize with your audience and with your recipient. We all say that and we all know we should do it, but for me this is a really tactical concrete way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:50):
I think what's great about a lot of the tactics you're sharing is not only is it going to help you communicate it better, but it helps you actually think and crystallize it better for yourself because you may realize, oh, that's a really good objection. Like, oh, the objection's probably going to be this. Will it drive enough impact for the business? Oh, that's a great point. Maybe I should not pitch this right now.

Wes Kao (00:53:10):
Yeah. It definitely helps shape your own thinking. I think communication and thinking are so much more interrelated than we think. I think people think there's a thinking as phase one and then communicating the thinking, and the reality is a lot more intertwined. And I loved your example there that thinking ahead to what might be the most obvious objection actually then prompts you to realize that maybe there was a gap in what you were planning to present and then you now have an opportunity to strengthen that pitch before you say it out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
There's a quote I have highlighted on this podcast a number of times that I love that is exactly along these lines by Joan Didion. "I don't know what I think until I write it down." I know exactly that feeling. Okay. So there's a couple more things that people have shared that you are amazing at helping them get better at. One is just keeping your cool and staying calm during very high stakes, real-time conversations when things maybe aren't going your way or if you disagree with someone, any advice on that, it feels like you're really good at this.

Wes Kao (00:54:17):
I think one thing that tends to throw people off is putting a lot of pressure on themselves to get the exact right answer. So if they are asked a question and they don't know the answer, a lot of people will then kind of freak out. And I was taught early in my career that if you don't know the answer, you should say, "Let me look into it, I'll get back to you." So that's a fine approach. It's definitely better than making something up, right? So definitely don't make something up. But if you are more experienced and have some confidence in your subject matter area, just saying I'll get back to you, is sometimes a missed opportunity. You can ask for a bit more information to be able to continue the conversation in that moment. So let's say that your exec says what percentage of users came from mobile last month and you don't have that number off the top of your head.

(00:55:20):
So person A says, "Let me look into it and I'll get back to you." Person B might say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter the number has been 60 to 70% and it's grown in the past year, so mobile is now a bigger part of our business, et cetera. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately or where's that commission coming from, basically? Right? And so being able to answer a similar question in the direction you think the person is asking about and then validating why they're asking that question allows you to still continue that conversation in the moment. I call it the question behind the question, sometimes you get a question, but underneath there's a deeper underlying concern.

(00:56:10):
And many times people don't even know that it's there, right? Subconscious. So it's not nefarious, they're not withholding anything from you. But when you are explaining something and you're kind of getting multiple questions on the same thing, it's a good sign that there might be a deeper question behind the question and it's our responsibility to figure out what might that be. And so probing, asking for a bit more information, answering in that general direction and then validating these are all techniques you can use when you are in the moment without feeling like, oh, I must have every single thing prepared and the moment that I'm caught off guard, everything goes to shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
Another tactic along these lines that's very similar to what you're describing, but I'll share that I learned that was really helpful is just if you're not sure what to say, basically just reflecting back their question and just being like, let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for. You want to understand monthly retention for, and then maybe clarify. And that one gives you time to think about it as you're talking. Two, it helps the person recognize, "Oh, he hears me. Great. Okay, this is good. He's thinking about this." And then at the end of that you could be like, "Okay. I don't actually have that specific number. Let me think about it." Or, "I have the quarterly number. Okay. That's what I know." So there's an interim step almost that I'll add into your piece of advice of just reflect back their question, just better understand what they're looking for.

Wes Kao (00:57:32):
Yeah, I love that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:34):
Awesome. Okay, let's go back to what I said we do. Let's pick one tactic that you think people should try first, maybe one or two. So let me read the ones we've gone through and then see what you think would be a good first step. So one is starting with sales, before getting to logistics and giving people the why signposting using specific words to help people guide the doc and not get overwhelmed. Finding the right level of confidence, having a POV, that sort of thing. Getting better, being concise, MOO, not overusing formatting, something else you shared. And then this idea of when you don't know the answer, not saying I'll get back to you as the default, maybe giving them a different answer, maybe asking them more questions. Across those, which do you think someone should try to like, "Okay. Let me start here."

Wes Kao (00:58:25):
I would start with Most Obvious Objection and also framing your conversation up front. And that kind of relates to using signposting words if needed to help you frame that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:37):
Sweet. That's such an easy one to remember. Just MOO. Okay. So stick a post it somewhere when you're about to share something in Slack and ask someone for something, present in a meeting, send a strategy, and just think about for a few seconds what might be the most obvious objection to what I'm trying to ask them to do. Great. Okay. So let's talk about management. And there's kind of two sides to it. Being a manager and being a person reporting to a manager, you have a bunch of really good advice here. One is there around managing up. One of my most popular posts in the early days was advice for managing up and just how important it is. What advice do you have for someone to get better at managing up? Why is that even so important? Why do you think people may be under appreciating how important it is to manage your manager, let's say.

Wes Kao (00:59:18):
One of the most common myths about managing up that I definitely felt early on in my career was that I would have to manage up if I were more junior, but eventually I would outgrow it, that I would get senior enough that I would no longer have to do it. And it was a rude awakening that no matter how senior I got, managing up, I not only had to manage up, it actually became more important. So I think managing up is one of those skills that if you invest in learning it, it serves you now and for the rest of your career. And I realize that many senior people are actually the best at managing up. That's partially how they got to be so senior in the first place. But also, the more senior you get, the less likely that your manager is going to give you really well-defined tasks and problems on a silver platter and ask you to solve them.

(01:00:09):
You are going to be dealing with more ambiguity and you're going to be dealing with sometimes a mandate like make this number go up or create this division, right? Where you need to manage up and make sure that your leader, your manager, is in the loop about what you are about to try and what you're about to do and make sure that they're aligned. And so for me, realizing that managing up is something that is ongoing and that it shifts and evolves and looks different as you go in your career, that was a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
Just that even if you become even a VP, if you become a director and still something you want to invest in, any specific tactic or advice for how to manage up well.

Wes Kao (01:00:54):
The biggest one is to share your point of view. So this some people are surprised by because they think I'm going to say do a weekly recap of the tasks that you worked on or what you contributed. And that is a good idea, if you want to do it, you can do it. But I think the more highly leveraged way to contribute and manage up is by being more vocal about sharing your point of view. When you just ask your manager, "Hey manager, what should we do?" You're putting a lot of cognitive load on your manager to need to think about the problem, think about potential solutions, craft the solution, and then tell you what to do. Whereas if you instead said, "Hey manager, here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" You give them something to build off of and that reduces the amount of mental lift that they have to put forth.

(01:01:54):
And so sharing your point of view more readily, backing it up with evidence, that's a wonderful way of making your manager's life easier. And also showing that you are an active rigorous thinker who is thinking strategically about the business. You're not just waiting to be told what to do, you're not expecting them to figure things out and then tell you you are actively looking around the corner trying to solve problems, forming hypotheses in your mind, observing and noticing things. And again, sharing your point of view doesn't mean that you have the perfect answer. You can share that, "Hey, I've noticed this problem popping up in a couple of different places. Here's what I think might be happening."

(01:02:36):
Or when you share a report, don't only share the report and expect your manager to come up with insights and takeaways. You should look at the report too and point out insights and takeaways. So it's really changing that posture from more reactive and more waiting to be told what to do or kind of staying in this narrow box to being willing to share your recommendation, your point of view, share what you're noticing, and this is something that even junior people could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:04):
I was going to say exactly that. I think not only is it something junior people can do, this is a really good way to get promoted and to take on more leadership opportunities. You coming to your manager with, "Here's something I think we should do. Here's a perspective I have. Here's an opportunity." If you were in charge, you're like, how awesome would it be for people to come to me with amazing ideas and have clear recommendations? That sounds great. Everyone wants that. So if you can do that, amazing. Who wouldn't want that? But then what's interesting is similar to how writing helps you crystallize your thinking, you coming in with a recommendation forces you to really think deeply about it because that's putting your reputation on the line. So there's a second order effect of it makes you actually spend more time on the thing and be clear about why you think this is a good idea and do more research. So a lot of wins here.

Wes Kao (01:03:53):
There are a lot of situations where you might have the most visibility into a problem. You might have the most proximity into an issue. And so if you're not speaking up about it and sharing what you're observing, sharing what you're noticing, your manager doesn't necessarily have visibility into that. And so I've heard so many managers say that they want their junior people to speak up more because their junior people have often close contact with customers, with support tickets, with cleaning data, with a bunch of things where the manager would love to hear insights from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
If you're not having success with this, if you're hearing this and be like, but it never worked, my manager doesn't listen to me, listen to the rest of this podcast we just did, which is basically advice on how to effectively convince someone of a thing. It's like, tell them why this is a problem, be really concise about it, sign post words, all these things. That's exactly what this whole conversation's been about. Okay. Let's see. We have a couple more really cool tactics that people have suggested we talk about. One is how to give feedback well, how to do better, how to be more effective at giving feedback. What's your advice there?

Wes Kao (01:05:05):
I have a framework called strategy, not self-expression. And so the idea here is that most of the time, by the time we are giving feedback to someone, we have been frustrated for a while. I used to be very conflict diverse, so I would wait and try to convince myself that I wasn't bothered by something until I really couldn't hold it in anymore. Then I would schedule a one-on-one with a coworker to tell them the feedback and it would inevitably turn into a venting session where I was in the name of sharing the impact of what they did would share all my frustrations and all the ways that they have basically harmed me and made my life difficult. And this would be very counterproductive because the person would either feel like and feel really demoralized or they'd get really defensive and they'd want to argue with me about how what they did actually was not that bad or it was partially my fault too or whatever.

(01:05:59):
And so I realized that a better way of giving feedback is thinking about motivating the person's behavior change. The goal is behavior change. So if that's the goal, trim everything else that you were about to say that does not actually contribute to that goal and only keep the part that will make the person want to change, help them understand the benefit to them as well as to the people around them. And so usually for me, that's trimming 90% of the initial stuff that I want to say and really keeping only that 10%. And that's made a really big difference. Whenever I am giving constructive feedback of any kind, I always keep that in mind. And when I don't do it, I almost always regret it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Someone close to me in my life is working on the skill, which is there's just, "I want people to know how they messed up. Justice. I need this to be fair." And what I always recommend is just think about what you want to get out of this conversation, what do you want from them? And then, okay, what's the best way to get that? Versus just making sure they hear you and making sure they understand how screwed up this was. And that's basically what you're saying is focus on the outcome you want to achieve, not something that's useful, something that will make you just feel better.

Wes Kao (01:07:23):
Yeah. I definitely think that having a space to vent and to share those frustrations is important. So you want to get that out before you go into the conversation with your counterpart. So whether it's talking to your therapist or your partner or friend, you want to basically get all that energy out because otherwise you bring it into the conversation and it doesn't take much to set you off. You might have a whole script, you're controlled, you're calm, and then you start talking and the other person raises an eyebrow and is acting a little incredulous at what you're saying, and that's all it takes for you to snap and be like, "You're surprised? You're incredulous? Why are you incredulous?" Right? And then you're off, right? Yeah. Getting that energy out, I would say step one, so that you can go into the conversation clear, grounded, setting that emotional tone that is more positive and that allows you to stay focused on only the part that will get them to behave in the way you want them to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Such good advice. And I think we come back to are you getting the outcomes you want? If you're not, this is another reason it might be the case is you just need them to hear your mind. I just need you to know. And I think a lesson here is that may not be the best path to getting what you want, but it may feel good. Maybe people are like, "Ah, but I really want them to know this."

Wes Kao (01:08:42):
There's that great Einstein quote about insanity being repeating things that you're doing expecting a different outcome. And I feel like that applies so much to the workplace and to communication. Most of us have certain patterns that we are used to and certain ways of responding, and if you believe that there is untapped upside that whatever you are at is kind of a local maximum and that there's better out there, then that's where switching things up could be useful and not just doing everything that you've been doing and getting the same result that you might be getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
This resonates with Toby Lutke when he is doing the podcast, talked about how... He had this quote that I love that just "No human in history has come anywhere near their potential and everyone is way, way, way better than they think are," and these are really cool tactics and really effective ways to actually get closer to your potential. Okay. Two more things I want to talk about real quick. One is your advice on delegating, but also continuing to have high standards. This is something I spent a lot of time on because a lot of people don't delegate because they're afraid it's not going to be as great. I just want this to be really good. I don't trust that it's going to go as well. If I did it my way, it'd be great. So just advice on how to delegate effectively while maintaining high standards.

Wes Kao (01:10:04):
Yeah. I have a framework called CEDAF. C-E-D-A-F.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:08):
Mm-hmm. I love all these acronyms.

Wes Kao (01:10:09):
It's kind of like Cedar, but with an F at the end. I need acronyms for myself. All of these are really reminders for myself because I need a short way to remind myself. So CEDAF stands for the C is comprehension. So have I given this person that I'm delegating to everything that they need to understand what it is that I want them to do. That includes more simple things like logins to all the right software tools that they need to look up, whatever you need to look up. And understanding what the end result should look like, right? So that's all under C for comprehension. E is excitement. Am I explaining this in a way that is making this as exciting as it could be? There are a lot of tasks that aren't inherently that exciting, but by explaining the why behind we're doing this or why it's important to the project we're working on, that makes people more likely to understand and be excited about how this fits into everything.

(01:11:06):
So E is for excitement. D is for de-risk. Am I de-risking any obvious risks from delegating this? So usually when I ask clients this, they immediately think of something. They're like, "Oh yeah, I wouldn't want my direct report to spend a ton of time going in the wrong direction, filling out a hundred rows of the spreadsheet if actually it took longer than we expected." Okay, great. If that's a risk, then maybe you have them do 10 rows, see how long it takes, see if we need all the information that they're actually gathering, and then regroup, right? So what's an obvious risk? Another might be I can see this person misunderstanding and thinking I'm looking for this where I'm really looking for that. Okay, perfect. Just tell them, "When I explain this, you might think I mean this, but really I don't want that. I actually want this," right? So just vocalize it. The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to-

Wes Kao (01:12:00):
The A is for align. So am I giving the other person a chance to speak up and make sure we are actually aligned, that they're picking up what I'm putting down? Because you might be explaining a bunch of stuff, but how much are they actually absorbing? You won't ever know if you wrap up your little spiel and then say, "Okay, go off. Come back to me when you're done." So give people a chance to ask questions to see what parts are resonating, what parts they might be a little bit confused on. Usually, when I do this, it's amazing. Because my team member will say, "What did you mean by this part? How does this part fit in?" I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot to mention this thing." Or, "Oh yeah, I didn't even really explain that well." Okay, so let's go into that.

(01:12:42):
And then F is feedback. How can you have the shortest feedback loop possible? I am a huge fan of shorting the feedback loop as much as possible and then shortening it again. So even within that initial conversation where I'm delegating something, instead of waiting a week, what if we waited a day and checked in on the initial direction that person was going? And let's do it even more. What if after I finished explaining, at the end of that conversation, we brainstormed a couple things that, that person wants to do? So within this same conversation, I'm delegating, I'm already getting a sense of, where do you want to go with this? Once you start, do you see any bottlenecks?

(01:13:24):
And so just really keeping that feedback loop super tight. I found that when I run through the CDAP acronym, there's usually one letter that I could amp up a little bit more like, oh, I didn't really put much thought into making this exciting for the person. How can I connect this to their career goals or to the company's priorities this quarter or to something else? So it's a nice mental checklist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
So much of your advice comes back to this idea that we've touched on a couple of times. We just spend a little bit more time upfront. Is that how you described it, a little more time upfront?

Wes Kao (01:13:56):
Yeah, a little bit more time. A little bit more of an investment upfront.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
Upfront to save you tons of time later. Okay. So as you described this, I don't know if you're realizing this, but you're basically just helping people work better with AI and agents. This framework is exactly I think what people need to effectively delegate to this future world of this agent world of society of agents doing work for us. Basically, you're going to be delegating to these agents in the future, and this framework is a really cool way to frame it. So think about it. Am I communicating this well, comprehension? So CDAP. Comprehension is, again, can I make this clear? Is that the way to think about that?

Wes Kao (01:14:41):
Yeah. Can I make this clear? Does this person have everything they need to be able to accomplish what I am asking them to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):
Okay. And then it's communicate why you're excited about this, basically the why. And it's interesting, there's this funny prompt technique I've learned, prompting engineering technique of just telling the AI, "This is very important to my job." Just using that sentence, it does it better.

Wes Kao (01:14:47):
Oh, interesting, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:04):
It takes it more seriously. It's just so weird. I have a post about this, and that's one of the pieces of advice, just tell me why this is important. I think people take it to the extreme as someone will die if you don't get this right. That actually works.

Wes Kao (01:15:16):
That is extreme. Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
It's wild. Okay, so CEDF, comprehension, excited, de-risk, think about ways you can de-risk, which is moot, basically. What's the most? It's a similar concept. Just think ahead to what might go wrong. Make sure you're aligned, which is quite important in the AI space. Make sure you're aligned. And feedback, get a quick feedback cycle. And it's interesting with deep research on some of these AI tools now, it's like, "I'm off for half an hour. See you." And I imagine more and more of them will check in with you as it's going and ask you questions. I used deep research recently and it's really good at just like, okay, let me have five questions for you before I go off and do this work just to clarify what you want.

Wes Kao (01:15:58):
Yeah, I found that AI will often shorten the feedback loop and align with you as well. When you prompt it, when it comes back, it will not do the entire task for me, sometimes. It'll say, "I've done the first part of this. Does this sound right? Is this what you're looking for? If so, I will complete the next section." And then sometimes I'm like, "Do the whole thing. Just stop trying to conserve energy and just do. I want you to do the whole thing." But that's what it's doing, it's breaking it into smaller chunks to de-risk that it's going to use all this bandwidth to process this thing and I'm going to say, "Oh, that's not what I was looking for."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
I'm going to come back to AI real quick, but before I do that, I have one more question for you, but let me just say, I feel like we've discovered an AI version of your course now. Basically, how to delegate well to AI agents that I think people are going to find really valuable, planting a seed. Okay. Before we get back to AI, you have this other concept that I love that I actually learned from you years ago when I was working on my course called the swipe file. Swipe file, what is a swipe file? What is that about? What can it help you with? Why should people be doing this?

Wes Kao (01:17:03):
Yeah. So swipe files are really common for marketers, and I think other functions haven't caught on as much, but I think it is really, really useful. And basically a swipe file is collecting inspiration that you can refer back to later on. So some marketers will collect examples of copy, landing pages, ads, et cetera. For me, I have a file, an Apple Notes, file called Smart Things People Have Said, where I will basically paste in phrases, words, things people have said that I thought were well articulated or sounded really intelligent or sounded strategic. And I don't actually go back and look through my swipe file very often, I think other people do, but for me, even the act of adding it to my swipe file, I've already gotten value from it because it's training me to be more alert to noticing when something is working well.

(01:18:01):
I think there's so much happening around us all the time that your coworker says something smart and you're like, "Oh, that was nice," and then you keep moving on. But when you stop and pause and think, oh, that was really effective, let me add it to my file, and also think about, why was that effective and is that something I can borrow? So in my course, I encourage folks to create a work journal where they can jot down some of these observations, some of these phrases, and basically encourage yourself to be more alert to things you can borrow from other people all around you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Something else about the swipe file, you use quotes. It could be screenshots of cool designs. It could be strategy docs you found to be really effective. It could be conversion flows that are really cool. It could be just whatever you're interested in.

Wes Kao (01:18:52):
Yeah. And the great thing about that is you can then go back and analyze it and break down the structure, break down the argument, break down why was this so effective? Whereas if you're not capturing it, it's easy to just move on to the next thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Yeah, cool. And I did this for a while. I stopped, to be honest, but I really want to be doing this. So this is maybe some homework or something, because I know a lot of people stick with it, is just start like a folder or a Notes, note, whatever you use for your note-taking, and just start throwing stuff in there. And it could be messy, right? It's just like, throw it in.

Wes Kao (01:19:27):
It can be super messy. I was going to say, my back end system is super messy and it's fine. It's not a problem I need to be solving. It works. I find things I need to find. So I like having as simple of a process as possible. So Apple Notes, I open it. It's just on my home screen, I just add something. I'm not tagging anything, I'm not putting it in certain rows and filling information out. I'm just including it in a file, and if I want to go back and look at it, it served its purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:58):
Awesome. Okay, so last question. AI, I'm going to just come back to this briefly. We have this segment on the podcast called AI Corner, and we touched on this already, but I'm just curious how you have found AI to be useful in your work or your life, whether it's helped you become a better communicator? Is there anything you can share that might be helpful to folks?

Wes Kao (01:20:18):
Yeah. I love Claude. There are days when I talk to Claude for three or four hours prompting as a thought partner. So yeah, I think that AI is really helpful for an initial draft of something to bounce off of. Sometimes I'll paste in an email that I am not quite sure how to respond to and ask Claude, "Tell me draft reply." And I'll usually give it some direction. So I found that sharing my point of view makes the output way better. If I just give it something and say, "What would you say?" It's just not as good. Whereas if I say, "I am not sure about how to tell this person no, because I previously said yes and so I feel on the hook, but history has changed and so is there a nice way where I can be really respectful of our relationship and also make them feel seen and heard, but decline?"

(01:21:19):
So if I explain, "That's the problem I'm dealing with and here's what I would ideally like to be able to do," Claude comes back to something that's pretty good. And then from there I'll edit it to my voice because usually it's a little bit too formal sounding. And so I'll make some edits and then I'll share it back to Claude and say, "What do you think of this version? Would you make any improvements?" And then we go back and forth from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:41):
Wes, this is the most useful thing I've ever heard.

Wes Kao (01:21:44):
[inaudible 01:21:44].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:45):
I need this and I need this immediately, just nice ways to say no to stuff. This needs to be an extension that I can have in my browser, just, "Help me say no to this, please." Wow, such a great idea. Okay, good one. Okay, great. Wes, is there anything else? We've gone through a lot. I imagine the answer is no, but before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Wes Kao (01:22:11):
No, I feel like we covered a bunch of great frameworks, principles, so lots for folks to get started.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
All the things. And I love that so much of this will apply to being more effective with AI tools and I feel like people can go through this again and just through that lens of, how will this helped me get more out of Claude and ChatGPT? I bet so much of this will actually apply and I feel like there's an interesting course there. With that, Wes, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Wes Kao (01:22:39):
All right,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Are you ready?

Wes Kao (01:22:41):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Okay. First question, what are a couple books that you recommend most to other people?

Wes Kao (01:22:46):
One is High Output Management by Andy Grove, which is a classic. Another one is Your Brain At Work by Dr. David Rock. And that one is all about better understanding your own brain and attention span so that you can allocate your mental resources appropriately. So that one's great. Ever since reading that, I hide my phone from view because there have been studies that show that even seeing your phone in the corner of your eye, it's distracting. And I do the hardest things earlier in the day when you have more cognitive resources available. So that one's really good. Yeah, those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
These are great. I completely get that phone thing. I'm just looking at my phone, I'm like, "Dang, get out of here. Just go away."

Wes Kao (01:23:36):
I will stick it under my pillow on the couch or hide it under a notebook. It's huge. I'm always hiding my phone so it's not in my line of sight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:47):
I think Arianna Huffington has a product you can buy that's a little bed for your phone that you put to bed before you go to bed in a different room and it has a charger attached.

Wes Kao (01:23:54):
Oh, that's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:55):
So cute, so cute.

Wes Kao (01:23:57):
I don't know if I need a separate bed for my phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:01):
But it's like a ritual, I guess, and there's some theory behind it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Wes Kao (01:24:08):
I love Anything by Harlan Coben on Netflix. Basically, I don't even remember any specific movies or a TV series, but anything he puts out, he's an author and then they've turned a lot of his books into mystery thriller TV series, and anything he puts out becomes number one on Netflix. And I appreciate that he gives the people what they want, that he knows his craft, he knows his genre. And yeah, he just has so many bangers. And I don't remember any specific one, but if it's a Harlan Coben show, I know it's going to be good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:46):
I'm looking at a list now I just Googled real quick. So it's all scary stuff, right?

Wes Kao (01:24:49):
Yeah, they're mystery thrillers, and I think he does a good job playing with time and revealing information over time. It's usually something about someone's past that is now coming to haunt them, and so he'll skip between present day to the past and then slowly reveal stuff. And there's always a twist at the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:11):
There's a page, the Harlan Coben Collection on Netflix. That we'll link to that has all this stuff. I've never heard of this, so this is great. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Wes Kao (01:25:22):
I recently started using an electric toothbrush and it's been life-changing. So my husband got one and then a couple weeks later he gifted me one, and I was like, "Wow, this is actually really nice."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:34):
Are you a Sonicare person, Oral-B person, or something else?

Wes Kao (01:25:37):
It's Oral-B but I've not tried any other brand. That was one that our dentist gifted my husband this electric toothbrush because he did Invisalign. And I'm sure Invisalign is every dentist's dream.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:51):
Margins.

Wes Kao (01:25:52):
I feel like every time I get a cleaning, the dentist is like, "So have you thought about, are you interested in Invisalign?" I'm like, "No." And so when they get a yes, I'm sure they're really excited, and then they lock you in, the brand locks you in with these replacement toothbrush heads that are way more expensive than they should be. So it's a whole razor and blades, ink cartridge and printer model here. So I was horrified by how expensive these replacement heads were.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:18):
But you got a free toothbrush. I think the Oral-B is what I use, but I think that's what the Wirecutter recommended, but it's so loud. I don't know. One of them is just really loud. I think it's the Oral-B, but it's better, apparently. I went with Wirecutter, but it's so loud. I feel like there needs to be a Wirecutter for good design and experience...

Wes Kao (01:26:37):
Ooh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:37):
... versus just the optimal efficient version. Anyway, let's keep going. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you repeat yourself and share with folks?

Wes Kao (01:26:51):
Yes. I actually have many, but I'll share two. One is everything takes longer than you think. So this applies whether you are calling customer support for something or running an errand or building your career, building skills. I find it's useful to add buffers for yourself. This applies for launches too. Just assume it will take longer than you think and you'll be less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That connects to everything we've been talking about. Just spend a little more time upfront to make it. And maybe if you spend more time front, it'll take less time than you think.

Wes Kao (01:27:25):
The other one is a riff on always be closing, like Glengarry Ross. "It's always be selling." This does not mean pawning your wares, but rather putting forth effort into convincing the other person of whatever your recommendation is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):
Love them. Okay, final question. So you've been a long time, I hate this word operator, but I guess that's the way people describe this, where you've just been working at companies, building companies, and you recently left that just to become creative person. Started a course on Maven. You do executive coaching, things like that. Any just lessons or a lesson from that jump that might be helpful to folks that are maybe thinking about that?

Wes Kao (01:28:07):
I think when you are an in-house operator, there's a lot about your role that you have a little bit less control over, basically. There's just certain things you have to do because it comes with the territory. Whereas when you are a solo operator running your own business, doing your own thing, you have a lot of freedom to craft your work around only your strengths, only the part that you are really good at, that adds a lot of value for other people where there's market demand. And so, for me, there was a bit of a shift where when I realized that I could craft my business, my work around only the part that I'm best at, and that can be a narrow-ass slice, that's actually really, really freeing.

(01:28:54):
And so I would encourage folks to think about, what is the thing that you are extremely good at that people find super valuable, the part that you love doing most, if you could not do all the other stuff you don't want to do, and how can you think about doubling down on that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:12):
That's such an important point. And the Claude tip you shared of how to say no well is such an important ingredient into that, because so many things come at you and are interesting and enticing that it's hard to decline, that you realize, why the hell am I doing this? I can actually control where I spend time and why did I say yes to this?

Wes Kao (01:29:33):
I actually credit you with helping me come to this realization. I mentioned you on a podcast the other day about this because, do you remember when Maven was launching an important feature, I think it was our marketplace or something, and I had asked you if you wanted to go on Clubhouse to be part of the launch?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
I remember that, but I am sure I said no.

Wes Kao (01:29:59):
Okay, yeah. You said no. You said no. And I was like, "Wow. Out of curiosity, what's the thought behind it?" And you said, I'm going to bastardize this, you could correct me, but you essentially said, "I don't really like doing live public speaking type things and I've been fortunate enough to build a career where I can write, I do my podcasts, and work only on the part that I love doing. And so I'm okay saying no to these other really interesting opportunities." And I remember at that time thinking it was so groundbreaking that you could say no to something that was legitimately a cool opportunity and be really confident about it because it wasn't your core competency. It wasn't the thing you are best at. And I've really kept that in mind when opportunities come my way of, am I excited about this? Is this what I'm really good at? Can I shine in this setting? Because when you are solo, you get to choose the settings that you want to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):
That's such a cool story. I don't exactly remember that, but I am zero surprised at what I said. And the way I put it now, when folks invite me to stuff like this is I just find the ROI on my time is so not worth doing a talk, doing a fireside thing, doing another podcast. It's just like, if I can spend more time on this newsletter than the podcast, the leverage is so much higher than just doing a talk because that takes so much time. So I just have this template now that basically says what I sent you, that is, that it helps. But it's tough. It's so hard to say no. Sometimes these opportunities are so interesting and the person is like, "Wait, what?"

(01:31:37):
Because I don't think the people asking you for stuff know that I'm getting 10 of them a day, and they're like, "Oh, he said no to my talk. He doesn't want to be on my podcast. What a jerk." That's what I think. I don't know if that's what they think. But anyway. Okay, that's great. Yes, and I think I just had a post about reaching a million subscribers to the newsletter, and actually had this image of the Ikigai concept, which is exactly what you just described, which is you want to try to find the thing that you love doing, that people value, and that you can make money doing. That's the dream. And that's exactly what you have done as well. So thank you for being here, Wes. I actually think we delivered on what I thought we would. I think this is going to be one of the most highest leverage conversations we've had.

(01:32:21):
So two final questions. Where can folks find your course? I know you also do executive coaching. Where can folks learn more? And final question is just, how can folks be useful to you, Wes?

Wes Kao (01:32:33):
You can find out more at weskao.com. I linked my course to my coaching from my main page. I also post on LinkedIn as well, so you can follow me there. And I'm always looking to meet fellow operators who out about communication. So if you put any of these principles into practice, I would love to hear about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:53):
Awesome. We'll do that in the comments. They can DM you. I don't know, what's the best way to reach you on the website or Twitter?

Wes Kao (01:32:59):
Yeah, bunch of platforms.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:02):
All the places. Okay, cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:04):
Website, email, LinkedIn, DM me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:05):
There we go. There we go. Wes, thank you so much for being here.

Wes Kao (01:33:08):
Yeah, thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:09):
Very cool.

Wes Kao (01:33:10):

## Transcript

Will Larson (00:00:00):
I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work." Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. And so actually one of the, I think, highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this kind of baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Today, my guest is Will Larson, one of the most requested guests I've had on this podcast. Will is currently CTO at Carta. He's been a software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm. He's the author of two essential books for all engineers, An Elegant Puzzle and Staff Engineer, and he's releasing his newest book The Engineering Executive's Primer in February of next year. He also publishes regularly on his blog at lethain.com, which is a must read for every engineer and eng leader.

(00:01:05):
In our conversation, Will shares advice on developing your engineering strategy and strategy in general, how to improve the relationship between an eng manager and a PM, how he finds time to write, while also working an intense full-time job, how he recommends approaching measuring engineering productivity, how to develop your company values, an amazing story about his time at Digg and so much more. Will is such a gem of a human and leader and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Will Larson after a short word from our sponsor.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, a platform for measuring and improving developer productivity. DX is designed by the researchers behind frameworks such as Dora, Space and DevEx. If you've tried measuring developer productivity, you know that there are a lot of basic metrics out there and a lot of ways to do this wrong. And getting that full view of productivity is still really hard. DX tackles this problem by combining qualitative and quantitative insights, giving you full clarity into how your developers are doing.

(00:02:07):
DX is used by both startups and Fortune 500 companies, including companies like Twilio, Amplitude, eBay, Brex, Toast, Pfizer, and Proctor and Gamble. To learn more about DX and get a demo of their product, visit their website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:02:28):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing it. Another date conversion edge-case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences.

(00:03:02):
From embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error online 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:03:36):
Will, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Will Larson (00:03:40):
Thank you so much. Super, super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:42):
So many people have suggested that I bring you on this podcast. You have a lot of fans out there and I am excited to be digging into engineering topics, which we don't do enough of on this podcast. So thank you for making time for this.

Will Larson (00:03:54):
No, thanks. I hope to be a good early engineering guest before you pivot entirely to engineering at some point in the future.

Lenny (00:04:04):
Wow, I love that. How cool would that be? I was an engineer actually when I started my career. How interesting would that be if we come full circle? Anyway, I thought it'd be fun to start with just what is changing in engineering? It feels like there's been a lot that has changed over the past few years, especially from kind of the ZIRP zero interest rate era to today's market, which is very different. What have you seen most change from an engineer's perspective and then just also what are you telling eng leaders about how to handle all this change?

Will Larson (00:04:32):
I think it's a pretty strange time in the market. So I think that I started working and right before the 2008 kind of crash. And so the first two years there were not so good. When I joined Yahoo, there was a layoff basically every four months. There was a layoff of some sort. It's pretty chaotic. But then we got into the last decade and it was just smooth. So numbers went up, revenue went up, headcount went up and people started learning how to build really large teams.

(00:05:02):
People started learning how to hire a lot. When I was at Uber, some days I would do six interviews back to back. I would just be in a conference room and at some point you can't even remember who you're talking to because you talk to so many people, one after another after another. You just have some scrambled notes you're trying to decode afterwards.

(00:05:20):
Pretty different now. A lot of engineering managers are spending half their time or more hiring 18 months ago and now they're doing two interviews a month or less. Maybe zero interviews a month. So there's a real shift in just the amount of time people are putting into hiring. Instead, all these different competencies that have become more critical or a really great engineering director might've just been spending their time hiring really well and that could be a top performer and now that person can't actually demonstrate what they're great at.

(00:05:51):
So that person might be perceived as a low performer if they're not also figuring out how to lead the team, getting deeper into the details and also sometimes getting into the figuring out what is the right allocation, what is the right sizing of the engineering teams, this is stuff that we weren't talking about much or maybe if you really pissed off the CEO, maybe an infrastructure you just grew a little bit slower next year, but different ballgame at this point where teams are actually disappearing, teams are getting cut down, teams are getting consolidated. And that's just something that we've avoided for that ZIRP era that now we become a core part of a lot of the job.

Lenny (00:06:27):
It feels like also engineers... They used to have a lot of leverage over companies, inside companies. I imagine that's also changing in a big way.

Will Larson (00:06:37):
I think that's true. I think this actually has been bad for engineers in some way. One of my hobby horses is that I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work."

(00:06:53):
Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. Actually one of the, I think ,highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well. That's a highlight for me and the shift recently.

Lenny (00:07:18):
I have definitely worked with that and experienced that where you don't want to piss off engineers. And so are you saying that because that's changing, leaders maybe don't have to worry as much about upsetting engineers plus you just generally think we shouldn't treat engineers that way?

Will Larson (00:07:33):
Yeah, I think a little bit of both, but I think there's been, in this previous era, where hiring and retention were one of the biggest ways you evaluated middle management. Losing team members was huge, huge issue. And so you started to coddle a little bit, which is actually bad, again, bad for the engineers, bad for the teams, bad for everyone, bad for efficiency of the organization. But now something that I love is we get to give engineers real hard problems and we get to actually hold them accountable. And that means we can put them in senior roles.

(00:08:07):
One of the things that I've been pushing on, I wrote my last book, Staff Engineer about what is the career path for senior engineers. One of the challenges is if we aren't comfortable holding engineers accountable because we just want to retain all the engineers, then we can't put them in senior roles. And so I think we're actually seeing a bit of a shift where we can actually hold them accountable, which means we can put them in senior roles, which means the engineers can actually get what they've been trying to get the entire time, but we haven't been able to because we've been coddling them a little bit too much.

Lenny (00:08:33):
Okay. So there's a few directions I want to go and I'm just going to poke around and see where we go. The first is you're a big advocate of systems thinking. We were chatting about this before. I think a lot of people have heard this term systems thinking and there's books about it. It's sounds great. I want to be a systems thinker. What does that actually mean? How do you find you apply it in your work? How do people get better at this way of thinking?

Will Larson (00:08:57):
A lot of the least successful but smartest people I've worked with were really strong systems thinking advocates. And so I do want to say every kind of framework has a lot of downsides. There's no framework that people can apply consistently, universally, and get good results. And so briefly on this one, what I see is often people will find a spot where their system and reality are in conflict and they'll be like, "Reality is wrong." And so what's a concrete example?

(00:09:28):
At Stripe, we worked on incident management. And so Stripe pretty important company where our API is available. If the API is down, you lose money and if you lose a lot of money, you leave Stripe because you're pretty upset about that. The number one thing businesses need to do is to collect money successfully for the service that they're selling, right? Stripe is super important.

(00:09:49):
And so we did a lot of analysis on incidents trying to understand why things weren't working, what we could do better, but we got so caught up in the analysis that we lost track of whether we're actually improving things. And it took us a while to figure that out because we were so stuck in the systems thinking model and it's not like, "Oh, the team was wrong." It's like, "I was wrong." I was caught up in that model myself, to realize like, "Hey, we weren't actually prioritizing improvements, we were just prioritizing measurement." And you can't keep measuring. There's measure twice, cut once. Sure, but you don't measure infinite times and never get to cut.

(00:10:25):
And you do have to cut at some point to actually make impact. But we just got caught a little bit there. I think a lot of people who get too far in systems thinking make the same mistake where they think reality is wrong and reality is never wrong. Reality is always right. Your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality. But that conflict, that gap is really interesting and that's where you can learn.

(00:10:49):
And so I had this model. It's really clean. It represents your hiring pipeline that moving through different steps. It represents your incidents and how you remediate incidents. It can model almost anything pretty quickly when you get good at it. And then understanding how reality is in conflict with that, you start to understand where your mental model is wrong and then you can go educate yourself and improve the model and just keep doing that.

(00:11:12):
At some point the model is close enough and you can stop doing that and go actually do the work. So that the biggest thing I tell people is this is a great way to learn, but you also have to do things. You can't just learn. That's not our entire job.

Lenny (00:11:25):
To make it a little more concrete, how would you best describe this idea of systems thinking? What's a good way to just like, "Okay. I get what you're talking about?"

Will Larson (00:11:32):
This is probably a better place to start versus a rambling anecdote about using it.

Lenny (00:11:38):
We can go backwards. It'll be great.

Will Larson (00:11:41):
Systems thinking is basically you try to think about stocks and flows. So stocks are things that accumulate and flows are kind of the movement from a stock to another thing. So what's a simple example of a stock? A stock could be the number of fish in a lake. A stock could be the number of people fishing in a lake. And so a flow between those two could be the number of fish in a lake will decrease at some rate based on the number of people fishing in that lake.

(00:12:08):
So if there's a ton of fishers, the stock of fish will go down faster. There's only a couple of fish, IT will go down slower. But also then there's these flows which kind of dictate that where if we've got much more efficient fishermen, the flow of fish out might go down, but also the fish do reproduce. So then there's another flow going back. So based on the current number of fish and the reproduction rate, the current number of fishers and their fishing rate, you start to see how these can evolve over time. And a lot of this.

(00:12:38):
So first always recommend Thinking In Systems by Donella Meadows. Really phenomenal book. And a lot of her work is also kind of referencing the work in Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, which talks about how small amount of carcinogens or something low in the ecosystem or the food chain rather as they get consumed by predators further and further up get concentrated. And that's a kind of a classic systems thinking problem to think about where you wouldn't think a small amount of carcinogens and a small fish actually matter. But as they go up the food chain, they start to concentrate it and an unexpected change can happen.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So then going back to your example of the hiring pipeline, let's come back to that to help connect this definition, which I've never heard, which is awesome, very clear to how you actually implemented say in hiring.

Will Larson (00:13:23):
The first thing to do is to get a model out there of any sort. And so you think about your stocks. And so in a hiring pipeline you might have potential candidates and this could be basically infinite, and then you have a couple of inflows. So you could have sourced, you could have outreach, you could have referrals, and then you have the candidates and those... How many people get sourced. There's probably a function of number of sources you have dedicated to a role. So you'd have another stock of how many sources you have and then that would impact the rate going from potential candidates to actual candidates you've sourced.

(00:13:59):
And then from candidates that you have in that box, you'd have a conversion rate for people who pass the first recruiter screen and that would move into step two of your process. And then from step two you have maybe a hiring manager screen and that would be another conversion rate. So you can see over time how the candidates of the infinite potential candidates like wandering around LinkedIn, posting about their deep thoughts, convert into actual people, your first, your second, your third.

(00:14:26):
But then as you get deeper into it, you start to actually see interesting things. And so for a lot of candidate or a lot of pipelines, the biggest issue is hiring managers don't want to extend any offers because the hiring managers can't get to confidence on any candidate. And you'll see in this pipeline, you'll see a ton of candidates getting to offer stage, but almost none of them converting from a potential offer to actually offer. And then you can say, "Hey, here's the problem. You need to go work with the recruiter and the hiring managers on getting conviction about who they should hire.

(00:14:56):
Classic problem with early managers, right? Here's a second problem. Manager wants to extend a ton of offers. They do extend them and none of them actually accept. And so that focuses you on the second problem. But there's a third potential world where actually you're just not getting enough candidates in. You're actually doing a great job of making decisions, great job of closing candidates. There's just not enough candidates coming in. And so by looking at this and you can build this model, then you can go to your applicant tracking system, a greenhouse or whatever and pull the historicals and you can just see how the historicals work versus how you'd expect it to work.

(00:15:32):
You can see the drop-offs and this helps you figure out where should you go try to fix things first. I think we've all worked in companies where you roll out big changes with no data behind them because like, "Oh, it feels like we're not hard enough in how we evaluate candidates or something." You go change a bunch of stuff. But often the real problem might be that the hiring managers making offer extensions to people who never passed the loop anyway. It's just the managers are issuing too many offers because they're panicking. And man, less true now, but a decade... Or not a decade, two years ago, hiring managers panicking to get offers out, that was a real thing that happened a lot. And this just helps you take a complex kind of abstract problem and turn it into something you can actually work in a systematic way.

Lenny (00:16:17):
I feel like product managers will either naturally do it things this way already because a lot of them think in funnels. And it's interesting to hear this version of it of this idea of just following the stock through the flow of the different steps. Awesome. Another thing that I know that you are very passionate about and spend a lot of time thinking about is engineering strategy. I think you have this kind of feeling like engineers don't think enough about the end strategy. Every other function has a strategy and engineers often don't. Talk about what you find there and what your advice is around that.

Will Larson (00:16:52):
First, I start to question whether any function has a strategy at most companies. My general experience is that there's very rarely a written strategy for any company. Sometimes it's a value statement. It's like we build the highest quality products and you're like, "Good. Okay. What do I do with that?" You're like, "Build a high quality product." You're like, "Okay. I don't don't know what that means."

(00:17:15):
Engineering often has this problem where I think people will make comments in their culture amp or their quarterly surveys or whatever. It's like, "Hey, the strategy is not clear or where's the engineering strategy?" And the biggest thing I tell people when they complain and then engineers complain about the product strategy. The PMs don't have any strategy or the business has no strategy. And the reality is product eng and business always have a strategy. It's just often not written down.

(00:17:45):
And so the first thing I want to do is I push people not to get caught up on the fact that there's no template out there, which is product strategy that someone has forked and filled in. It doesn't mean you don't have a strategy. You do have a strategy. It's maybe a little bit hard to articulate and maybe it's applied inconsistently across different layers of the product reporting chain because it's not written down. But it's never true that there's no product strategy. There's always a product strategy. Sometimes it's bad, but there's always one. And true for engineering as well. There's always an engineering strategy. Just sometimes it's bad.

(00:18:21):
The first rule of strategy is that if you write it down, then you can improve it. If it's not written down, it's hard to say if this PM is just not a good PM or if they're trying to apply the strategy that they've misunderstood or if they actually are correctly applying the strategy from the head of product that's just not appropriate to the problems they're working on, how do you debug any of that?

(00:18:43):
If you have a written document, even if it's not a super compelling strategy, at least you can start debugging. It's like, "Hey, the head of product should improve the clarity of this document. Hey, this DM actually isn't applying it correctly. Hey, the strategy actually isn't appropriate for this one business unit where it makes sense for the others."

(00:19:02):
So that's the first thing I think about. But the second big theme on strategy I think about is that often good strategy is so boring. It's hard to talk about. For example, on the engineering side of thing, a common strategy that's really good but very boring is we only use the tools we have today. So a lot of times you'll get engineers that want to introduce new programming languages, new databases, new cloud providers. And a really good strategy for almost all companies is like we just use the standard kit we already have today.

(00:19:39):
And at Carta, when I joined one of the engineers, Eric Vogel wrote the standard kit and that is our strategy of the tools we use. And you know what? Some people are really frustrated by that and I feel for them. It feels like they're losing control, but the power of these boring strategies is that it focuses people's energy on the problems that we value as a company. And so it is painful coming into alignment if you're kind of slightly misaligned over time, but boring strategies that tell you what actually matters and aligns you with what the company actually caress about are really good for you even if they're a little bit annoying at a time. And I can expand on this idea a lot, but I won't ramble indefinitely on it.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Well, maybe what might be helpful is what are some other examples of engineering strategies that you've seen just to give people even more just like, "Oh yeah, maybe this should be part of our strategy."

Will Larson (00:20:31):
So first, what is a definition of strategy? And the best one I've ever seen is from Richard Rumelt. He wrote Good Strategy, Bad Strategy.

Lenny (00:20:40):
He's coming on the podcast.

Will Larson (00:20:42):
Amazing. He also wrote, The Crux I think came out this year sometime, which I also read. I think both great and just a phenomenal thinker who has so much depth. I think one of the challenges of writing about strategy is you're like, I've seen two things and I write the book, but I think the thing that's impressive about Richard Rumelt is he's seen so many different scenarios that he's able to really operate from both the particular but also the general and dataset in a really interesting way. Another book with similar characteristics is How Big Things Get Done by... I forget the authors, but really amazing dataset of how mega projects kind of succeed and fail.

(00:21:21):
But anyway, Richard Rumelt, definition of strategy is basically three components. There's a diagnosis. What is the current status quo? What are the things that are real today? There are guiding policies which are basically based on the diagnoses, how do you want to address them? And there's actions. And actions are how are we going to implement these guiding policies. He talks a lot about actions because concerned about this idea of inert strategy where you have like, "We're going to deprecate our old product features we don't use, but no one deprecates any of them."

(00:21:52):
So he's really concerned about this non implementation kind of useless strategy that doesn't do anything. On engineering, I'm a little bit less worried about that. I think strategy is more interesting on engineering in terms of clarifying how we make future decisions. And so what are a few examples of that? At Uber, we only used our own data centers. We didn't use the cloud. And this has changed since the era I was there, but in the 2014 era, no cloud, and we had a strict no cloud policy. And this was annoying because we had to indent everything ourselves or run copies of everything ourselves.

(00:22:28):
But it also meant that we were able to spin up in China in literally three months and some surreal stories from that. We couldn't fit our racks into the data centers, so they had to take the roof off the data center and lift the racks in with the crane.

Lenny (00:22:43):
Holy shit.

Will Larson (00:22:43):
Just tons of stories and all this had done in three months and truly phenomenal. And Uber wasn't in China for very long, so in some ways you're like, we did all that just a leave? But they left with a nice stake of Didi Kuaidi and not a bad outcome overall. But I think that strategy, we run everything in data centers. We don't use the cloud, meant we were able to move in and out of different geopolitical constraints and companies that relied on cloud presence simply can't. There are fully constrained by where AWS or Google Cloud or Azure have built out. So that's one good example.

(00:23:21):
Another good example at Stripe was this idea of we run a Ruby monolith and that's what we did and that's evolved a bit since then. There's more Java and the Stripe of 2023 than there was in the stripe of 2016 or the 2012 or whatnot. But that policy really focused the engineers on building innovative features for our users rather than building different tooling to support different programming languages. And so in both cases, both the Uber policy around running our own data centers and the Stripe policy around Ruby monoliths, a lot of engineers hated these.

(00:24:02):
But the goal of good strategy is not to appease everyone. The goal of good strategy is to dictate how we invest the limited capacities we have or the limited capabilities we have into the problems we care about. And I think both of them were really effective towards that end.

Lenny (00:24:17):
A common theme across all these examples is essentially constraint, deciding we will constrain our options to move faster and focus on the things that really matter.

Will Larson (00:24:28):
In solving the constraints is to me, I think the most interesting thing that strategy really does, and I think when we talk about bad strategy usually is because the diagnosis is bad and it's usually because people are exerting what they want to be true on constraints where it's like, "Hey, we can do all of these projects at once." And often that's just not true, but it's hard to convince people that when they're the CEO or they are really committed to believing it, but almost all bad strategies basically come down from a willful disbelief of what an accurate diagnosis is, which means then your guiding policies are kind of incoherent to begin with.

Lenny (00:25:08):
Awesome. I'm excited for that episode of Richard where we're going to go real deep into strategy, but maybe just as a lasting topic around there, if someone listening wanted to get better at say end strategy specifically or a strategy in general, is there anything you recommend they do? Is it read these books? Is there anything else?

Will Larson (00:25:26):
If people want to get good at strategy, there's a lot of different types of strategy, but here are some things I'd really recommend. First, I think the Richard Rumelt book, I think Good Strategy, Bad Strategy is probably the right starting point. I think The Crux also quite good, but maybe I would read that one second. Great overview of how to think about strategy. Also Thinking in Systems, I mentioned that before related to systems thinking, a big part of strategy is being able to model the reality so we can improve your diagnosis.

(00:25:56):
So I think that one is really quite good as well. If you get into the engineering side of things, there's a lot of interesting books here. There's Technology Strategy Patterns by Evan Hewitt. There's The Value Flywheel effect by Anderson, McCann and O'Reilly. The Phoenix Project by Kim, Behr, Spafford, which is a modern rewrite of The Goal by Goldratt. But I think there's still the missing canonical book is kind of missing on this one. So I took a stab at strategy and my upcoming book, which is coming out the Engineering Executives Primer coming out early next year.

(00:26:33):
Also, took a stab at it. In staff engineer my previous book, but I still think there's a missing book here. So I am dreaming of writing an engineering strategy book for my next project, although we'll see if that actually comes together.

Lenny (00:26:48):
Well, let's actually follow that thread of writing something I was definitely hoping to chat about. You write a lot. You've written two, three, four-ish. You're writing a new book. How many books you've published? Two books and there's a third one coming up.

Will Larson (00:27:00):
So I have two books. First one with Stripe Press, the second one, self-published and the third one with the Riley coming out in two months effectively.

Lenny (00:27:08):
Okay. And then also many, many blog posts for many, many years. I asked a few people what to ask you, and this came up a lot, Gergely Orosz and Alex Xu from ‎ByteByteGo both asked just this question of just, "How do you make time to write as much as you do?" And then I also, I'll ask this too and just answer it either first or second, just what impact has writing had on your career? Why do you keep doing it?

Will Larson (00:27:37):
I feel really strongly that you can write a lot more if you write what you want to write. And so this is one of the reasons I don't write for financial gain and I don't write very much on a schedule, so I've done a few pieces for magazines, et cetera, but I find that actually really draining to be you have a topic, you have to agree on the topic. If a topic starts missing what you want to write about, you can't fix it a lot of the time and you're also on this deadline. You're like, "Ah, I'm screwing up. I need to ship this. It needs to be done tomorrow."

(00:28:12):
I just find that really draining. Conversely, when I own the schedule, when I get to write about, "Hey, I'm writing out something." So I started writing this infrastructure engineering book a couple of years ago. It just wasn't there. I just couldn't get it to come together and so I just stopped. I'm not writing it anymore. Maybe I'll come back to it at some point, but probably not.

(00:28:34):
To me, the biggest strength of writing what you want is you get to write where there's energy and you don't have to write where there's no energy, which takes you really, really negative. And this also ties into how I write books, which is that I basically write the entire thing before I start working with a publisher. And if you are, I think diligent and good at anticipating what their concerns are going to be, you can mostly reuse the content that you're trying to write. This is also easier in the sorts of books I write.

(00:29:05):
I think harder to do in a really technical introduction to MySQL or something, you can't just resequence those chapters and pretend it's going to work. Those chapters build in a different way than the sort of business book that I write does. Writing the stuff that's energizing and just giving up on the stuff that's not energizing, that's how I write a lot and how I've been writing for 16 some years. And the way I keep doing it is just by writing what's energizing and what I'm thinking about now.

(00:29:38):
I don't write what I'm not thinking about and I don't write for any audience, I just write what is interesting to me. And that means some people don't like it and that's great. That's totally fine. It's not really for them, it's for people who want to follow the ride and that's where I focus.

(00:30:55):
Okay. There's a lot more I want to dig into here. How many posts have you written do you think over the 16 years?

Will Larson (00:31:00):
I would guess about a thousand. That would roughly be my assumption. I think there are a few years where I wrote hundreds of posts, and so if you do that like three years, it's not that hard to get to a thousand from there.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's incredible, especially because you've had intense jobs for all of those years or most of those years. Very high pressure, fast growing hypergrowth companies. Somehow you find time to work. So first, let me just double click slash co-sign your advice here around paying attention to what gives you energy and working on things that you're actually curious about. This is exactly the advice I give to people. A lot of people start this full-time writer, creator life, and they're like, "What do people want? What do people want me to write about? What's popular? What's going to inspire go viral?"

(00:31:48):
And that's easy to do a couple times, but then you end up creating this job for yourself that you don't want. You don't want to be spending all your days writing about AI if you're not that excited by AI or whatever's hot these days. What I find is important is almost like 80, 90% of what you write has to be stuff you're excited about. And then maybe there's a bit of, "Here's what I know people really want. Here's what I know is going to do really well." Because otherwise you just burn out. You create a job for yourself that you don't want. Why would you do that?

Will Larson (00:32:13):
Yeah. I just a hundred percent agree with that. I think the other thing is that everyone converges on the same thing that they think people want. So it's crypto two years ago. It's like AI right now or it's counter AI. AI is going to ruin the world. It's hard to say something very novel because, one, everyone is trying to say something about it. Two, it's almost certainly not what you're that knowledgeable about where if you just stick in your lane, I think the biggest risk to writers is quitting.

(00:32:43):
A little bit like the 40-year career idea. The biggest risk to content creation of any sort is quitting soon because you get burned out. The biggest risk is not that you grow too slow initially. There's always this sense that you've missed the wave. It's too late to join Substack. The top writers are already there. You'll never be a top writer. It's too late to podcast. There's too many podcasts. You'll never make it. It's too late to join Medium. You'll never make it. There's too many Medium writers.

(00:33:11):
But it is just not true. If you just keep writing good stuff, you'll build an audience over time and you can take that audience from platform to platform. What really matters is finding something you can actually keep doing for the next decade. That's way harder than doing it for one year.

Lenny (00:33:25):
We have the same exact advice on this. This is exactly the things I tell everyone. When I joined Substack, I thought it was too late. I was like, "Man, it's over." And when I started this podcast like, "Oh man, there's a billion podcasts. How is it ever going to work?" So I so agree, and I also so agree on the fact that this whole thing is such a... It's a long game. There's a lot of people. I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it up. Nobody actually keeps it up because people are going to come and go. The thing that really separates success from failure is just people that can keep at it. There's not an end game to this. It's an infinite game and it's about being able to sustain that over the long term.

Will Larson (00:34:04):
You're not competing with other content creators. If you think of it as an infinite game, you're all working together. You can all help each other grow. There's no maximum number of product writers or thinkers who can be doing something. You're not less successful because [inaudible 00:34:22] exists or something like that. There's no competition there. It's like a false, false dichotomy.

Lenny (00:34:27):
Yeah. I totally agree with that. Unless there's so many and then all of a sudden what happens is the bar just gets higher, which is good because then people get better stuff and that's fine. That's happening anyway. Just the bar continues to increase because there's more and more content out there. And to me that's the ultimate thing you got to get right is just the bar. You just got to be at a high bar for anyone to care about anything you're writing about. And to your point, to do that well, you have to actually be excited about writing about it and have background and have something to contribute.

(00:34:59):
I'm just ranting here, but the way I think about this is you need to add something new to the conversation for anyone to pay attention because there's so much fluffy, superficial stuff. And to get anyone to care is you need to say something new that no one's heard before or share new information they haven't seen anywhere else.

Will Larson (00:35:15):
I totally agree. I could keep ranting about this for the entire time. I don't want to derail on this, but I totally agree.

Lenny (00:35:23):
We'll control ourselves. So then getting very tactical, I think this is what a lot of people are always wondering, how do you make time? What's your workflow? How do you make time for writing so that you keep at it with knowing you have an intense full-time job?

Will Larson (00:35:34):
I used to do things differently before I had a kid, so I have a three and a half year old and just timing your life just really shifts a lot once you have kids. But the biggest thing that I found is finding things to write about that also directly relate to what I'm working on. And this is where I can do something that helps me at work and helps me write at the same time because I think it's incredibly hard to find time to write about stuff that has nothing to do with your work.

(00:36:05):
And this distracts you from your work because these... Particularly if you're in a senior role, these can be pretty demanding jobs, but they're not demanding because you're responding to an urgent DM on Slack every five or six minutes. They're demanding because you need to make some really difficult decisions really well. And I think writing about related topics is a great way to refine your thinking and improve your performance. It's not like a conflict or you do one.

(00:36:34):
You either write or you do your job well. I think you can find a way to align. And so a lot of podcast folks do interviews with folks who are related to what they're thinking about at work, and that's a great way for them to learn, build their network, to refine their thinking, to test their thinking against experts in the field. It's not like in conflict with the work, it's in alignment. So that's one piece. But yeah, I've played around with my schedule a lot.

(00:36:58):
Before I had a kid, often Saturdays would be the writing day and so morning and early afternoon would just be writing. I can't do that anymore, so now I mostly write at night, which is tricky from an energy management perspective. But the biggest thing I would say is just if you're actually excited about something, you will find time and energy for it. If you're not excited about it and it's 9:00 PM, you're just going to get asleep. And so I really think that this is where you have to schedule a little bit deliberately, but the first thing we talked about around energy management, they really come together. When your schedule gets tight, if you're not energized, you just won't get it done. And why would you? It just doesn't make sense.

Lenny (00:37:41):
Just to close out this thread for someone that wants to do more writing knows that it's going to be valuable, but just hasn't any one tip that you would leave them with to get on this train?

Will Larson (00:37:51):
It depends why people want to write. I tell people, if you just want to write something that is going to help advance your career, you should really focus on writing two or three really good things and spend a ton of time drafting, revising, getting feedback. You just focus on making one great artifact or two or three great artifacts. You don't need to create a long-running blog where you publish every week. There's really no need to do that if your goal is just to create some artifacts that show you're a deep thinker, that help position you in the industry.

(00:38:21):
Don't start a newsletter if you just want to advance yourself in the industry a little bit. Just write two or three really good things. So that's the first thing I'd say. But if your goal is to write a lot consistently over time, my biggest advice would be just publish. And so there's a lot of people out there with stuff that hundreds of drafts and they've not published anything. And my thing is I publish almost everything I write. If there's something that I'm not going to publish, I don't start writing it because I have a quick check in my head like is this something I can write and publish?

(00:38:56):
And if my answer was like, "No, I just don't even start." And my accuracy has gotten higher over time as I've written more, but I published pretty much everything I write. That's why some of it is not that good. And that's okay. Again, I want to write. I want to get these ideas out. I want to show what I'm focused on and my evolution as a thinker trying to learn how to operate in these different roles in these different companies. I'm not writing trying to create a polished perfect thing, and also I'm not writing to maximize a reader's experience of reading it.

(00:39:27):
Some people don't like that, and I think that's a totally reasonable thing not to, but I think what I can bring you is my experience as an operator who's actively learning and thinking through. I think that's really valuable to other operators in the industry. In terms of giving you the perfect writing, I try to do that, closer to that. I don't know if I ever hit perfect writing, but that's where my books are. The books are taking a collection of thoughts over a couple of years, cleaning them up a little bit, packaging them. They're way higher quality than my typical writing.

(00:39:56):
But yeah, I would just publish a lot. Don't worry about the quality. Sometimes people will send you silly feedback and I just don't respond to that stuff anymore. You never know why people send you something like that. I think trying to debug people you don't know is a bad use of time. It's just kind of like, "Thank you. Move on to the next. Don't even spend time worrying about it."

Lenny (00:40:19):
I like that term debug people. I think people way overestimate how much anyone cares about what you put out. Most people are going to look at it for three seconds and be like, "Eh." That's the worst case scenario basically is just like, "I don't care about this." Not like, "Oh, Will is such a fool." What a dumb thing to say. Right? No one has time for that.

Will Larson (00:40:38):
And if they do, that's a them problem, right? The internet is a big place with a lot of people and there are people who are going to be having a really bad day when they encounter something you do and they're going to channel that anger at you or that frustration at you, but that's not about you. That's just like you happen to be there when they engage with it. You don't have to take that on. That's not your situation. It's okay.

Lenny (00:41:03):
Also, when you're just starting out, that's going to be the least stressful time to write because nobody knows it or sees it, so that's when it's like "Take all the crazy... Just do stuff." It only gets more stressful as you build an audience over time.

Will Larson (00:41:15):
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely true.

Lenny (00:41:18):
Okay. Shifting topics. There's a lot of product managers that listen to this. Something PMs often wonder is how to have better relationships with their engineers, their eng managers. What advice could you give to product managers to build more productive happy relationships with their engineers and eng managers?

Will Larson (00:41:37):
So the core problem, and most of the EM PM peers that I've worked on... There's two core problems. So one, sometimes the incentives are misaligned and that's hard to navigate, but if you can just be honest with each other and understand the incentives, sometimes you can find a compromise, but sometimes the EMs and PMs will be misaligned because just their incentives are so far apart that there's no way to get to the bottom of it. And so this might be timeline related or saying yes to sales related. Or the engineer is like, "Hey, we definitely can't say yes to that." And the PMs are like, "Actually, we're going to say yes to it because really important for me getting promoted," or something like that.

(00:42:19):
Is it ever this simple? It's really never that simple. People create simplistic narratives to find villains that they work with. There are no villains in the workplace. They're just people with complex incentives that are doing complex things. But sometimes I talk to EMs who think, "Oh, the product manager is just saying yes because they want to get promoted because the salesperson will review their promotion or something."

(00:42:40):
The reality is never as simple. The reality is the business needs to sell stuff to remain functioning. You can't just say no and have the business succeed. That doesn't work either. So one, understanding the incentives. The other piece though, and I think this is the more common case or just that the EM or the PM just don't understand the other person's needs and they start arguing before understanding. So my biggest advice to both the EMs and the PMs, is before you try to solve the conflict, it's like pushing to ship this feature, pushing to change the approach. Just make sure you actually understand what they care about.

(00:43:17):
There is this idea that you have to make trade-offs and that there are tons of hard trade-offs to be made in the field, but my experience is if you really deeply understand what everyone wants, there's usually a compromised solution that gives everyone exactly what they want. That doesn't take more time. You just have to be willing to dig deeper into it and understand the true needs for each party, which is often not what they're saying by the way, which is part of the confusion.

Lenny (00:43:45):
On the incentives piece, is there anything you've seen work to fix that problem? Because if PM performance reviews are based on impact engineering, performance reviews are based on interesting projects or uptime, do you just work to change those ladder definitions? What actually can help that situation?

Will Larson (00:44:05):
So my biggest thing has been trying to force this idea that EM/PM pairs are peers and they generally have the same performance rating. And there's exceptions here. It could be the EM is clearly not performing and then it's not the PM's fault if the EM is can't show up to work. The team doesn't respect them. Sometimes there's clear non-performance, but generally hard situations are not situations where one person is obviously terrible. Those are easy to diagnose, those are the easy ones. But in cases where there's two folks who seem to be pretty good, but just the overall execution is not working out, I think this idea that same perf rating for both drives a level of one pain, but the right perspective.

(00:44:56):
Also, something that I think Carta has experimented a little bit with over time. Henry, our CEO has a blog post about trifectas in doing that, but not just for EM and for PM, but also for that business leadership as well where you all get graded the same score based on your ability to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just your functional constraints.

Lenny (00:45:20):
Wow. That's so interesting. So your recommendation, something you're doing, it sounds like is the engineer manager and the PM get the same performance review rating? And so they're discussed in the same meeting.

Will Larson (00:45:33):
Our chief product officer, Vrushali and I spend a fair amount of time calibrating together and making sure... Again, there's cases where there's an exception because there's clear issues happening for someone. But on average that is what's happening. And I think people know that's what's happening because we told them that. And I think that's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:45:55):
That is so interesting. I've never heard of that approach. That is definitely solving that problem of EM/PM or...

Will Larson (00:46:01):
Yeah, the incentives are shared now, which isn't perfect. It's still hard to balance them. They can still make the wrong trade-offs, but at least they understand the incentives are shared, which I think is a pretty powerful idea.

Lenny (00:46:15):
That is really interesting. I imagine some companies might even want to include design managers in that, take another step.

Will Larson (00:46:23):
The role and the primacy of different functions in different companies varies so much that it's hard to have a one size. You could also imagine where you want a staff engineer in that or not. And so I think very company specific. But yeah, I think design could absolutely be involved particularly for a design led company like an Airbnb or something like that.

Lenny (00:46:43):
Wow. So interesting. Maybe just as a final thought there, if a PM is having challenges with their EM, what do you think PMs maybe don't realize their engineering managers are finding important or maybe are stressed about that they're just like, "Oh wow, I never thought about that."

Will Larson (00:47:00):
I think one of the biggest challenges I've historically seen, particularly in the last decade is this idea that engineering managers have the job of giving their team interesting work. I think that that can put... You often see this in growth teams where the growth team is like, "Hey, we just need to do a ton of experiments." An engineer is like, "I want to build something brand new." And the eng managers in between those try to figure out, "Need to ship 50 experiments that are pretty boring and they want to do something brand new. I don't know how to do solve this."

(00:47:30):
So it's a tricky moment. And good EMs find the way to balance, but that's the biggest source of ongoing friction where the EMs have been told by their teams they need to do something that the PMs just have no visibility into. And it makes the EM seem totally unreliable partners because they're trying to solve these little bit of these invisible constraints. And that's where I think pushing further to understand, "Hey, you keep prioritizing this rewrite into a new programming language."

(00:48:00):
To me that seems like completely idiotic thing to be doing. What's going on? And then once you understand, you might not agree with them, but at least you can have an honest conversation about how to navigate those constraints versus just like, "Man, you won't believe what my EM partner did today. This bozo did blah, blah, blah." And having this victim villain mindset about your peers.

Lenny (00:48:24):
An adjacent topic that I wanted to spend some time on is measuring engineering velocity productivity. I think it's probably one of the most common and also maybe the most annoying questions eng leaders get is just how do I know if my engineers are moving as quickly as they can? How do we help them move faster? What advice do you give to eng leaders for eng teams just for how to measure productivity well?

Will Larson (00:48:44):
This is a question that's coming up even more in a moment when we're reducing a lot of the size of teams from the industry when the venture capitalists that are on the board for these venture-backed companies are pushing on the efficiency of engineering. Engineers are trying to figure out how do we represent this? How do we prove that we're appropriately productive for the amount of headcount and funding that we have as an organization?

(00:49:09):
And man, that's hard. So the first way that people focus on trying to answer these questions is just benchmarking by the amount of funding that you have. And that's pretty straightforward to do is a mechanical exercise. You get a data set from your venture capital funds or whatnot, and you figure out, "Okay. How much should we be spending in R&D? How much should we be spending in engineering? How much should we be sending on infrastructure engineering in R&D?" And you can benchmark this all out and figure out what the correct numbers are there.

(00:49:40):
The problem is this is a very mechanical and not very insightful, driven way. It'll get you a defensible answer. It's like the old, no one gets fired for buying IBM, which definitely hasn't been true in my career ever. But this idea that if you just have the right benchmarks, DCs won't judge you for spending too much in engineering, but this doesn't actually help you get to the right place. It just helps you get your board to be less angry at you, which is useful because it's hard to do good work when your board is angry at you.

(00:50:13):
But it's not useful in the sense that it doesn't actually help you run your organization effectively. So then there's the much harder mediator problem of how do you actually know if your R&D team or engineering team is effective? What I find is a couple of things. First, if you're a good leader and you talk to engineers, they will tell you... The engineers know if their teams are effective or not. And if they're not, they'll also tell you why not. And their diagnosis can be wrong, but there's a crumb you can start picking up and you can trace the crumbs to figure out what's wrong.

(00:50:49):
Often you'll have more experience to analyze the complaints to figure out what kind of the contributing causes are to them. But yeah, if you just go talk to the team on an ongoing basis, you'll know if they're effective or not and you can go work to solve those specific problems. But again, you can't tell your board, "Oh, it's fine. I talked to the teams that they're good." My intuition's spot on because how do they know if your intuition is good or not?

(00:51:17):
They're dealing with a huge portfolio and some of their leaders are talking to are good, and some of them have terrible intuition. How do they actually assess? I think it's tricky. What I've tried to do is basically two things. One, aligning engineering evaluation to the business and product goals. So I want us to be wholly accountable with the product goals. Well, we did a good job products like screwing up over there. Obviously, a lot of companies find comfort in doing that, but really we're here to support the product, to support our customers in doing something interesting. We're not here to build novel systems unless it supports the customer and the product.

(00:51:59):
So first try to align heavily there. Second, I think just showing the roadmap of the valuable things we've done in the last six months is really powerful. I think sometimes people are like, "I don't have anything to put there." And you're like, "Yeah, that's a real issue." Or if you have the ton of stuff to put there, that's great. I really find that if you just commit, show the number of meaningful, meaty things that have impact that you're doing and you can explain the impact, people will step back and give you space. If you can't populate that list, people will have concerns and rightly so, they should be concerned about that.

Lenny (00:52:36):
Is there any metrics or tools or anything like that that you find useful too? Because these are all awesome piece of advice, but I imagine everyone is always just like, "Give us this number we're tracking, give us this dashboard, see what engineers doing."

Will Larson (00:52:49):
So one of the most influential books in the last decade in software engineering leadership and infrastructure is Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and I believe there's a third author on that one, but I'm forgetting right now. Really phenomenal book and it comes up with these four metrics. It comes up with lead time. It comes up with incident remediation time. It comes up with failure rate. And the fourth one of some sort. There's at least 50 different startups out there that are selling you dashboards that instrument these pieces of data and they want you to just evaluate your team on them.

(00:53:30):
The challenge is these are really good diagnosis metrics. And so hey, our deployments are slow. Why is that? How do we speed them up? But your deployments being slow doesn't make you a good company or a bad company, it just tells you where you should focus on improving. It doesn't actually change how you are. And similarly, if your lead time is quick or slow, it tells you where you should invest or it doesn't actually tell you if you should fire your engineers or something like that. That's way, way more details specific.

(00:54:00):
So people do like to see these metrics just like they see uptime metrics. A lot of engineers report on sprint points or stuff like that to their board, which are just totally, totally fake thing to be reporting on. But people get some comfort on it. So my biggest thing here is when people measure things, this isn't an engineering only problem, but when people measure, they take on the perspective of an expert and they can tell you why not to measure everything. They can tell you why every measure is wrong or inaccurate and they rule everything out and so they measure nothing and they go to someone who's not an expert and well actually there's no accurate measure to give.

(00:54:37):
They're not an expert is like you don't know what you're doing. And so you just have to get comfortable measuring something that's not perfect, but you can actually measure and reporting on it and then the measure that's imperfect as people ask questions, that's an opportunity to educate people on why the measure is imperfect. What are some things that misses or kind of the lies from the conversation.

(00:54:59):
Metrics are about educating the people consuming the metrics about the reality of the rich data underneath. They're not about this perfect data set that shows everything starting with something mediocre and the Dora metrics are really helpful for diagnosis, but if you have to, they can also be a good enough starting place to start reporting to your board or your CEO or to the other executives and then you're like, "Oh, there's all these problems with them."

(00:55:22):
Yes. There are all those problems with them, but that's this place you start and you educate people up from there to help them understand the nuances and that's how they become more sophisticated, understanding engineering, not by refusing to give them anything they can possibly measure.

Lenny (00:55:36):
Awesome. I'm glad that was your answer because we had Nicole on the podcast and she talked through Dora and all the frameworks that she recommends. And she even actually shared some benchmarks that she points people to that give you some sense of just like, "Are you in a good place roughly or not?" So we'll point people to that episode to dig deeper. Awesome. I'm glad that you're a fan.

(00:55:55):
Okay. Just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. One is around values, company values, org values. Do you have some really good advice for people for how to think about coming up with values? What do you share? What do you recommend to people that are trying to figure out what values they should define for their org and their company?

Will Larson (00:56:14):
I mean, values are really interesting, right? And different companies talk about values in different ways. I once worked at a company where the execs went to visit the Facebook campus. They saw the values written up on the wall and they took the Facebook values and wrote them up in our walls and that didn't do a whole lot. It maybe undermined people's confidence in the critical thinking of the executive team that just took these written up on Facebook walls and replicated it.

(00:56:39):
But I think those values did work well for Facebook and those values were meaningful for Facebook. And so first you can't do is just steal values. Value cargo culting. Users first. Great Amazon value. A lot of companies aren't users first and that's okay, but what's not okay is when you put, "Hey, we're users first," and then you actually show the decisions you're making and you clearly aren't users first.

(00:57:06):
So one of the things I think about is just honesty. And so good values have to be honest and so any value can be honest or there's no universally honest values. You can say something like, "We're thrifty." Or we can say something like we spend as much as we need to get the best value. Those are totally different and good companies are run both ways. So the first rule I think about a lot is honesty. You actually do what you claim you do and the value. The second one is applicability. You have to have value that you can actually figure out how to apply to your work.

(00:57:39):
And so one of Stripe's values was no longer a value I believe, but it's optimized globally. And so optimized globally is a really interesting problem because sometimes you'll have something you wanted for interesting value. Sometimes you want to do something and you're like, "Hey, I want to introduce a new programming language that's better for my team." For the organization overall, this is actually much worse for the organization so I'm not going to do it.

(00:58:03):
Uber didn't have this as a written value, but implicitly Uber's value was do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else because that will slow us down. So the two different companies had opposite values, but they're both very applicable. It's like how should we navigate decisions? Should I optimize for my team or for the organization? So those are applicable to real problems and they were honest where Uber was just like, "Don't worry about other people." Make it work for your team. And that's how they moved so fast because they just didn't worry.

Lenny (00:58:32):
Wasn't their value of toe-stepping, encouraging toe-stepping, something like that?

Will Larson (00:58:36):
Let builders build toe stepping. There were a number of values that could be interpreted in different ways and sometimes they got weaponized in various ways as all values do. But these are both interesting in different ways. And so number one is honest and two is applicable. Three is I think the last thing for a good value is this idea of reversibility. So there's some values that aren't actually usable. And so here's a good example. We build good software. Okay. But why would you ever not build good software? That doesn't make sense or we solve customer problems that matter. Good.

(00:59:22):
What company doesn't think they're solving customer problems that matter? And so there's certain values that just you can't apply. And so I think of these as identity values. These are really just you describing who you want to be or we care about our customers. Great. But who would say they don't care about that? There's certain values that I think of as just identity values and they're not wrong to have identity values, they just aren't very useful.

(00:59:51):
You can't actually use them for anything. And so I just always push people not to spend too much time on these because they feel good when you're an executive team debating what are these identity values? It's like we're kind to other people or sure that sounds good. We're a family. Sure, that sounds good. That one I guess is a little bit reversible. There's Netflix, which is like, "We're a team like a sports team. We're not a family." And so a little bit reversible, but not perfectly.

(01:00:20):
But yeah, these are the three that I found really useful for any value. Is it honest? Is it applicable? And can you reverse it? And if not, it's probably actually not helping the team make decisions.

Lenny (01:00:30):
These are great. It reminds me a lot of... I was there during Airbnb's period of coming up with values. Something that I would maybe add and maybe fits into one of these buckets is it needs to be clear who doesn't? There needs to be a group that doesn't quite fit because if everyone fits, you're not doing anything useful. What's the point? Which feels weird to say, why would not everyone fit in our big group of awesome company? But it's clear who is not a good fit, who doesn't belong basically. It's kind of like a cult a little bit like, "Who's not in our cult? Who doesn't belong?"

Will Larson (01:00:59):
But I agree. If it doesn't apply to anyone, then why bother saying it? It doesn't mean anything. And you could say it's actually the hiring filter where there are people who you've explicitly chosen not to hire because this wouldn't apply to them. Then I think it's useful because it helps you actually figure out who to bring in. But if it doesn't apply to anyone you're hiring or anyone that you have in the company, then it's just isn't worth having because you already have too many values. You are already trying to get rid of values because you have 17 and you need to get down to four where people can remember them. So if it doesn't apply to anyone, why bother having it at all?

Lenny (01:01:32):
Yeah. Integrity is a common one. Integrity. Everyone has that. Nobody wouldn't want integrity. What is unique?

Will Larson (01:01:38):
We're a non-integrity company. We're the company that thinks integrity is bad. That's not a real thing.

Lenny (01:01:45):
The other one I'll add to is honest. So Airbnb, we had six values initially. One of them was simplify and a year or two later everyone just realized we're not actually good at this. We want to simplify, but we're not great at this skill and values should describe who you are not who you want to be and aspire to be. So they cut two values including that one, and they're just like, "Let's just do these four because this is actually who we are. Let's be honest with ourselves."

(01:02:11):
Okay, final question. I wanted to visit Failure Corner, something that I've added recently to this podcast where people share a story of failure. And you have this amazing post about your experience with Digg and the rewrite that you all went through. I think it was the version four of Digg. Can you just tell that story and what happened? How much of a mess it ended up being?

Will Larson (01:02:33):
Yeah, Dig V4 is... I mean, it's still something I have a lot of fond memories for. There's one picture that I've kept and there's a picture of a lot of the engineers around this table in the middle of this giant office and they're serving sushi. We had waiters, caterers come in that day. They're serving sushi. They have plates with champagne flutes on it. There was a full bar and we're all around this table because the site is not up.

(01:03:03):
And so Digg before essentially what Kevin Rose or the board or some combination there realized is that Digg was losing to the social networks and that this idea of aggregated news was going to be outcompeted by the Twitters, the Facebooks, et cetera, if we didn't find a way to move to have a social component for it. It even outcompeted by Reddit longterm was kind of the fear. Although at the time that that was far from obvious. And so we needed to move to support social functionality and the previous version we simply couldn't get it to work.

(01:03:39):
So the decision that was done, I think two and a half years before I joined, and the shift about six months after I joined was they needed to do a complete rewrite in order to get there. This is a decision that never works out for anyone. So I think as someone with more experience, I could have predicted this wasn't going to work out. But I was earlier in my career. My PM counterpart at Yahoo, Das Kofinovsky. He went to Yahoo and he's like, "Come to Digg."

(01:04:10):
Worst case you'll make a couple hundred thousand in a year. Worst case. Probably really great outcome. Anyway, that's not what happened. The worst case was a little bit optimistic. So we go and the CEO got fired two days before I joined. So the current CEO left and then Kevin Rose came back for about six months, something like that. And we're just on the death march trying to get this thing out.

(01:04:37):
So we pushed really hard. This was before the cloud for the most part. So we wiped pretty much all of our existing servers to re-image them to the new software. We try to bring the site up and just keeps crashing. And so it basically takes us a month to get it fully functional again. And so that day sitting around that table with champagne and sushi, that's just like day one. And by 30 days in, most people aren't even trying to get the site back up anymore.

(01:05:08):
There's maybe five of us who are still trying. And we did. I think that was a really powerful moment for me. I think in the first two days myself and Rich Schumacher, one of the other engineers, we had to write a caching system from scratch, which got us half the way up. Really a terrible way to do software on a side note. I'm not recommending this to anyone. This was a series of anti-patterns kludged into a launch. But we got it partially up, but we had to restart it every 12 months.

(01:05:41):
Every 12 hours, every server had to be restarted even with the caching mechanism. And then about three weeks after that, I finally figured out what the core bug was, that was bringing us down every 12 hours. It was this incredibly simple issue that had just been hard to debug, basically related to the way that Python initiates variables used as default parameters. It's something super silly and we just had someone who hadn't written Python before who was working on the API code, so they didn't realize it's gotcha.

(01:06:15):
Then no one else caught it when it was reviewed and it just took a long time to debug. It was such a non-obvious. It didn't break anything, it was just doing a lot of extra load on the servers. We finally figured it out and it was just really remarkable experience pulling through. And you know what? The company still went to zero. So we had this at launch. I think we did this heroic, heroic stretch to get it working.

(01:06:43):
A couple weeks after that, a new CEO came in, did a round of layoffs. This is back I think 2012. The team nine months after I started was down to 30 people from about a hundred and it went downhill from there, from a business perspective. But we launched a lot of functionality, has really learned just a tremendous amount. And it kind of shaped what I think about in terms of early in your career, getting learning and going into a company that is maybe having a rough time.

(01:07:15):
I became a manager two and a half years into my career. Basically running the entire engineering team there because everyone who had a lick of sense quit or got laid off, and it was just complete idiot me trying to be the manager for the engineering org, wasn't qualified and no one would've given me that job, but I was the only one dumb enough to take it at that point. I learned so much and I really the kernel that turned into my entire career where it was that opportunity, even though at the time it was pretty grim.

Lenny (01:07:49):
That's an amazing story. I feel like a lot of these experiences were in the moment, it's just like, "What is going on? This is so bad and hard," end up being the most interesting and looking back end up being the most biggest teaching experiences. The ones you like bond over with people you work with like Apple. It always comes to mind where it's just like Steve Jobs's joke, people like crazy and then they look back and that was the best moment in my career.

Will Larson (01:08:12):
You would never voluntarily take on a lot of these really challenging things, but sometimes when they show up, you're with a group of people you really respect, you love working with and you want to overcome together. And that's really powerful experience. Even if Uber China was similar where if someone had been like, "Hey, do you want to go work on this Uber China migration?" I would've been like, "Absolutely not." But no one asked. They're just like, "Get this done," and so we did. I think these things are pretty remarkable.

Lenny (01:08:39):
And just to be clear, so Digg was down for a month basically during this period? Is that...

Will Larson (01:08:43):
So it basically didn't work properly for much of the month. It was like read only was back up in about three days, but the vast majority of the actual user functionality just wasn't working properly for pretty much an entire month and it was not that good. I mean not great, but that wasn't the biggest problem Digg had at that point. But it was one of the biggest problems that had at that point and it wasn't a real sign of things likely to go well for us. But like I said, you learn from those and I'm really proud that we and the team got it working, got it running even if ultimately we still went to zero and ran out of money and kind of sold for parts.

Lenny (01:09:32):
Do you think Digg could have made it? There was a world where Digg would've been a hugely successful business or do you think it was just way too late and it's the wrong product?

Will Larson (01:09:39):
The thing that really killed Digg is the change. It wasn't SEO driven. So monetization was from ads. Well, many companies including Digg claimed that it was the first in kind of stream, in feed like advertising company where Twitter has ads within the tweets or Facebook does. But Digg did that before Facebook or Twitter really innovated the ad format. But the vast majority of monetization was on these... We call them permalink pages, which is page 40. Then article we crawled and the vast majority of traffic for that was driven by Google search. And so there was an SEO change, which really is the thing that started creating the urgency for us to launch this migration.

(01:10:20):
SEO changed, traffic started going down, monetization was driven by that. And so we were already on fire by the time we tried to launch this. But I do think that I still want something like what Digg was trying to become today. Social news based on like what my friends are actually reading and liking merged with a global index of similar users who are interested in similar topics. It's still a product that I think Google Reader has some kind of similar components to it.

(01:10:49):
These are both interesting products solving interesting problems that have not for whatever reason been successful as businesses. And I do think there's a gap there still, but there's a lot of people trying unsuccessfully to fill it and there must be a reason why people struggle to fill it despite so many people trying.

Lenny (01:11:06):
Awesome. Will, is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very fast lightning round because I know you have to run in about five minutes?

Will Larson (01:11:16):
I think we've covered a lot of it. New book coming out. New book coming out in February, Engineering Executive's Primer, O'Reilly. But that's probably it.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Awesome. Where do people find that? I know it's on O'Reilly. You can look at a preview of it even today, right?

Will Larson (01:11:29):
Yeah. O'Reilly, you can see the early copy. You can order it on Amazon as well, but it won't be shipping until February.

Lenny (01:11:37):
Okay. And then just to be clear, who's this for? It's for engineering executives by the sound of it.

Will Larson (01:11:42):
It's for engineering executives, but more so like anyone who wants to be one, anyone who's trying to figure out how to work with an engineering executive. So I think if you are struggling to understand why your CTO keeps doing boneheaded things, or if you want to side manage them, you're the head of product and you can't get the CTO to stop complaining about the engineers need more interesting projects to work on, this might be useful for you too.

Lenny (01:12:04):
Amazing. Okay. Ready for the lightning round?

Will Larson (01:12:07):
Let's do it.

Lenny (01:12:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Will Larson (01:12:11):
So I talked about Thinking in Systems and Primer. I talked about Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, but I'll give you a third one, which is Don't Think of an Elephant by George Lakoff. It's a really interesting book about framing things in conversations that has really changed how I communicate.

Lenny (01:12:24):
Amazing. Favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Will Larson (01:12:28):
I don't watch much TV or many movies anymore, but something I do still watch is Top Chef with my wife. She's a Top Chef, super fan. And there's something just very relaxing from these formulaic structured shows where you kind of know what's going to happen. There's no real consequences that matter too much and just escaping from real life to these formulas can be pretty peaceful.

Lenny (01:12:50):
No one has ever mentioned Top Chef before, so that's fun. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing for a job?

Will Larson (01:12:58):
A lot of my interviews now are trying to help people decide if they actually want to join a company. And so my favorite question I ask now is like, "Hey, we've really loved you. You're going to come through. I think you're going to get a lot of offers from other companies too. I bet you'll have three or four really compelling offers because you're a fantastic candidate. How are you going to figure out really specifically which of those options are right for you?"

(01:13:22):
I think it forces people to tell you what they want and then you tell them why you have that more than anyone else, and then you can actually pitch them on what matters versus pitching on things that don't.

Lenny (01:13:31):
Love that. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, find useful either in work or in life?

Will Larson (01:13:40):
No mottos, but I can think of two things I thought about a lot. At Uber is something I talk to people a lot because it was a challenging time for much of it. It was there's no way around, just through.And that was like, "Hey, we're not going to dodge around this. We're going to gut through it and we're going to get to the other side and then we're going to be there." What I think about a lot more now is, will anyone remember what we decided in six months? Because I think people stress out about a lot of decisions, but I increasingly believe most decisions people stress out about just aren't that important.

(01:14:11):
So I'm like, "Will anyone care in six months what we did here?" And the answer is no. Just do something reasonable and let's move on to the next more important thing.

Lenny (01:14:17):
I love that. You've done a lot of writing. Is there a piece that you've written that you feel like is underappreciated that no one really totally got and hasn't spread and you're like, "Ah, I'm so proud of that one"?

Will Larson (01:14:30):
Maybe the piece I'm most proud of from last year was Hard To Work With. So Hard To Work With is basically I see a lot of people who are incredibly talented, but they try to hold their peers to a high standard and then they're viewed as combative or difficult to work with. And this one comes from a core struggle of my early career where I kept trying. I thought I was holding people accountable and people were just like, "You suck to work with."

(01:14:58):
And I was like, "But I'm just trying to have a high standard. Isn't that what we want?" And talk about honest values. Every company is like, "We have high standards," and you're like, "Well, let's do it." And then they're like, "We don't have high standards here. You suck." So that one is one that really is so transformational to me, and I think it really hits some people hard because I think a lot of people really go their entire career without figuring this one out.

(01:15:20):
And they're some of the most talented, hardest working people you'll ever work with and can't quite land this one idea that's holding them back. And they care so much and they are often despised because they care so much. I think this is one that I hope more people will read over times and there's a really important lesson for me in there.

Lenny (01:15:42):
Well, we will link to it in the show notes and help more people discover it. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Will Larson (01:15:51):
So find me online, lethain.com, lethain.com. All my writing, my books, everything links linked there. And the biggest thing that I'm thinking about right now is just strategy. So really curious for folks who are thinking about strategy, who think they've done product, business, or engineering strategy well. Would love to hear from folks what they're thinking about, what's actually worked and maybe what are the lies that have not turned out to work that they thought might work earlier in their journey.

Lenny (01:16:19):
Amazing. Will, thank you so much for being here.

Will Larson (01:16:23):
Thank you so much. This is really fantastic.

# An inside look at how Figma builds product | Yuhki Yamashita (CPO of Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:15):

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

(00:32:44):
As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma. And you can tweet at me, you can find me anywhere. And, of course, we're also hiring, so if you know great people or are interested, yeah, there's a lot of roles, so please get in touch.

Lenny (01:08:06):
Awesome. Yuhki, thank you so much for being here.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:15):

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

(00:32:44):
As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma. And you can tweet at me, you can find me anywhere. And, of course, we're also hiring, so if you know great people or are interested, yeah, there's a lot of roles, so please get in touch.

Lenny (01:08:06):
Awesome. Yuhki, thank you so much for being here.

# How to grow a subscription business | Yuriy Timen (Grammarly, Canva, Airtable)

## Transcript

Yuriy Timen (00:00:00):
The only thing that's worse than a channel or a tactic that you tried not working. The only thing that's worse now is when you didn't give it the appropriate shot, right? And you prematurely were erroneously concluded that it doesn't work and it's remarkable how often you find that to be the case when I talk to companies, "Oh, YouTube, we tried it. It doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay, can I see what you've tried?" And then you look at it and you're like, "Oh, this thing was not designed to even have a shot at working from the get go."

Lenny (00:00:40):
Yuriy Timen is a full-time advisor to companies looking to figure out their growth strategy. He's worked with companies like Canva, Airtable, Otter, Whimsical, Hims, Flow Health, and a dozen others. I know a number of founders who have worked with Yuriy and they all tell me that he transformed how they think about their growth. Before becoming an advisor, he spent nine years at Grammarly where he led growth in marketing and helped turn that into the household name that it is today.

Lenny (00:01:07):
In our chat, we get incredibly tactical about all of the ways that you can grow your product, including when and how to invest in virality, SEO, and paid growth. What's changing across each of those channels and the most common failure modes for B2C startups. This is the most tactical and actionable conversation I have had yet on how to grow your product, particularly a subscription product. And I'm really excited for you to hear it. With that I bring you Yuriy Timen.

Lenny (00:01:36):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flat File. How many B2B SAS companies would you estimate B to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:44):
At least 40%?

Lenny (00:01:46):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:49):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:08):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup, conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:23):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:03:50):
Yuriy, welcome to the podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:52):
Thanks for having me man. This is great.

Lenny (00:03:55):
It's even better for me.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:57):
All right.

Lenny (00:03:58):
So I'm going to give a quick bio. Let me know if I missed anything really important. You were head of growth at Grammarly. You spent nine years there kind of doing all the things that helped turn that company into the killer product that it is today. You left that I think a couple years ago. Now you're advising companies mostly full-time. I think mostly on growth strategy. I think mostly consumer startups, is that about right?

Yuriy Timen (00:04:21):
A couple of super critical corrections. Number one, it was only eight and a half years.

Lenny (00:04:26):
Okay. Usually people round those up. I'm impressed that you get-

Yuriy Timen (00:04:31):
I think eight and a half is long enough. Yeah, not sure I want to round up. I know, but I'm kidding obviously. Yeah. That's largely it. Grammarly was a hell of a run and trying to take a step back from that, and stepping back has kind of taken on a life of its own vis a vis advising.

Lenny (00:04:54):
How many companies have you worked with at this point advised and what are some examples, just like companies people would know.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:01):
It's now been about, I guess two years and three months since my last day at Grammarly in an operating capacity. I've probably worked with maybe 15 companies in the last two and a little bit of years. Obviously, not all at once. It's usually four to five at any given point in time. But some of the ones that I've been really lucked out with in terms of getting aligned with companies like Canva, Airtable, Hims and Hers in the personal care space, there is otter.ai. Who else? Flow Health, the world's most downloaded period tracker.

Lenny (00:05:47):
I used that for my wife. It's handy.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:49):
Good, good. Yeah. I was trying to get my wife to try it out, but been unsuccessful.

Lenny (00:05:59):
You're failing in your growth.

Yuriy Timen (00:06:01):
She was like, "Are you trying to push me to having a third kid?" I was like, "No, no, I swear." This is just product testing.

Lenny (00:06:08):
Clever. So I've had Casey Winters on this podcast and Elena Verna. It's kind of like the three of you that it feels like have worked with the most companies as advisors. I don't know if there's some kind of contest y'all have or anything, but do you think about that at all? Is there anyone else out there that you think is in the running?

Yuriy Timen (00:06:26):
First of all, just being mentioned the same breath as those two is an accolade in and of itself. I mean, I look up to both of them. They've gone first. Also, I credit a lot of my getting started to both of them because they've been very generous with their time when I was just kind of considering advising, especially Casey, if they listen to this. Huge shine out to both of them, but Casey especially. He's such immense when it comes to just being generous with his time. So no, there is no competition, but had there been one, I suspect I'd be in lead right now because I've done it. I've done it in a shorter period of time. I'm much newer to advising than both of those, but no, I have a ton of aberration respect both of them. They're phenomenal what they do and I learned a ton from them.

Lenny (00:07:24):
I love that acceleration is fastest. Wow, sweet. So we're going to talk a lot about consumer growth strategies and your experience working with companies and a bunch of insights on things you've learned from working with companies. Before we get there just one quick question in your advising. I'm curious how many companies do you work with at once normally?

Yuriy Timen (00:07:43):
Yeah, so I play around with different quantities. So a couple of things. So you mentioned, you alluded to earlier that I advise full time. What I'll say is that mostly the only thing that I do right now professionally is advising, but it's not quite full time. I hard count my week at about three to three and a half days a week worth of work, which is a personal choice. And so that is a hard constraint that I'm working with. And within that constraint, I also feel like for me to do my best work and the work that I also enjoy the most and find the most fulfilling four to five companies is probably the max. If I try to go beyond that, the overhead that it creates in terms of the cost of context switching just becomes overwhelming. I feel like I'm not showing up as best as I can with each individual company.

Lenny (00:08:43):
As early plug or anti plug, depending on how you answer this. Are you looking for more companies to work with right now or are you just like, "Don't even try. I am so at capacity right now."?

Yuriy Timen (00:08:53):
I'm so at capacity right now. I've also just been very fortunate to always be at capacity. But I think for every four to five companies that I'm working with, think of it as a concentric circles, right? There are another, maybe 10 to a dozen companies that we're actively exploring if we want to work together in the future. And then there is another concentric circle so maybe 30 plus companies that I'm just friends with. So I'll take the plug. I'm always up for meeting Austin founders working on important problems.

Lenny (00:09:31):
Cool. Well, we're in the plug I guess. How do people find you online? What's your Twitter?

Yuriy Timen (00:09:34):
I mean, honestly, probably throw Lenny's podcast. That's one, but honestly LinkedIn is really the only place I'm pretty low key otherwise.

Lenny (00:09:45):
Okay, great. That was a lot of Meta stuff. So let's get into some meat stuff here. So you talked to a lot of consumer startups. You help them figure out how to grow, how to evolve their product, something I'm always curious about and I love your thoughts on is when you look at a consumer startup, I imagine there's a few archetypes of how they grow. I'm curious if that's a mental model you use when you're like, "Oh, I see company X. They're probably going to grow this way, and here's what they should focus on." How do you see that?

Yuriy Timen (00:10:11):
Great question. I think there are ways to answer that. My sweet spot is subscription properties and it's not just consumer. I do work with a lot of B2B companies. It's just that most of them, but what they all have in common is they lean into consumerized type of growth loops and growth motions. So they're very kind of self-serve nature or have meaningful self-serve engines. So if I think about subscription companies, I think there are probably a couple of buckets that I see them falling into. If you were able to nail your unit economics and you have really strong consumer LTVs, think Grammarly, think Canva. The single player LTVs for those companies are very, very high. They're kind of average S&B LTVs for B2B companies.

Lenny (00:11:03):
What's a number there just for folks to have a little context?

Yuriy Timen (00:11:06):
I'm not a liberty to speak to those, but we're talking in the hundreds of dollars. Most consumer subscription companies that are $5 to $7 a month. Their LTVs typically cap out at 50 to 60 bucks.

Lenny (00:11:25):
Cool.

Yuriy Timen (00:11:26):
And so if you have really healthy LTVs, and that usually means that you're attracting a proconsumer buyer, so they may be single player, but they're using it for work. And so maybe they're dispensing it or just the perceived value so much higher that they're willing to bear that $120 and $130 a year subscription. If I'm seeing things like that and I'm seeing that you're converting seven, like five plus percent of your free users to a paid subscriber, then there is a big opportunity to play paid and lean into paid growth loops and paid acquisition loops. There is another archetype, which is if there are network effects for instance, you don't find that as much with single player consumer subscription companies, but obviously social media, consumer companies.

Yuriy Timen (00:12:17):
There may be a strong referral viral loop angle if the utility increases, the utility of the product increases, the more users are using it. Another archetype I see are companies that can lead into SEO very heavily, especially if there is a long tail programmatic angle. Take Canva for instance, their biggest initial growth loop and I think this is public knowledge was their long tail SEO strategy where any kind of design project that you could think of would search for designing. It's kind of two categories of keywords, make keywords and template keywords. So if you're searching for a template of any kind, a wedding invitation, yada yada, they had incredibly strong SEO and they were just capitalizing on all the long tail traffic. Not every product is going to lend itself to that, but I always look for that early on, because you can build incredible mold with that kind of strategy.

Lenny (00:13:21):
That makes sense. There's kind of like these three engines that you can tap into. I imagine the preference would be word of mouth reality and then if that isn't going to work SEO, and if that is going to work paid, maybe just to simplify it for listeners, what are kind of signals you can go after virality and invest in that and think that could work because every founder would be like, "Yes, virality. That's how I'm going to grow." Yeah.

Yuriy Timen (00:13:47):
Yeah. Honestly, the first thing you look for is that, is there inherent product network effects? It's something that it's either there, or isn't from inception from my experience. I think it's very difficult to manufacture. You'd only study when... It's very hard to manufacture product network effects if they aren't there from the get go. So Airbnb from your days, obviously marketplace very strong product network effect dynamics. You think of collaboration tools, Airtable, monday.com, Whimsical, whom we both know very strong inherent product network effects, contrast that with a company like Grammarly. It just wasn't there. It's not an inherently multiplayer task constructed communication. And so you can try to engineer that, but from my experience, it is an uphill battle. So if you have inherent product network effects, that's when I think layering on referral loops and viral loops. You think about what Dropbox has done around file sharing. That's an iconic example.

Yuriy Timen (00:15:02):
Then it's really powerful. I think that there is another case where referral and viral loops could work even when there are inherent network effects. If you have a really beloved product, beloved brand. There's a company out of Australia that I have opportunity to invest it called Laika. They do fresh dog food subscriptions and incredibly beloved brand, a premium product. And so they're able to lean into a give one, get one referrals, even though there isn't inherent product network effects, they're still able to generate meaningful results off of the, and incentivize referring program.

Lenny (00:15:39):
When you talk about network effects, what does that mean to you? How would you define that briefly?

Yuriy Timen (00:15:45):
Yeah, to me, I mean, honestly I define it I think probably a pretty quintessential way, which is for every individual user, the utility that they derive from the product increases the more users there are on the platform. The expanded version of that is in a case of marketplaces. It may not be the bore users broadly speaking, but the more users in the markets that you care about, in the case of collaboration tools, it's not the more users in abstract terms. It's the more users within your team, the more users within your company, right? That correlates with your kind of the rise in your utility curve.

Lenny (00:16:33):
Awesome. So if you have network effects, AKA if the product becomes more useful with more people or there's amazing word of mouth already, or there's collaboration, probably a good sign that you could lean into virality or maybe referrals. What about SEO?

Yuriy Timen (00:16:50):
Oh, that's a good one. It's a very timely question because I actually in a process of helping a couple of my companies figure out if it's the right time to invest in SEO. So I've been sort of a forefront of taking exploratory meetings with agencies and SEO consultants and things like that. I mean, I would say the first thing to figure... I mean, there are a couple of pillars, because obviously we all know that SEO has a different return horizon than say paid acquisition. It's longer out. It's maybe six months is the earliest you can see results. Even then it's going to be a small trickle that compounds over time, if you're successful or you may spend three to six months leaning into an SEO strategy and then realize that it's not going to back out typically at least in historically a company probably isn't like Series B before it starts feeling like it passed a luxury of making these kind of medium to long term investments.

Yuriy Timen (00:17:58):
But I think that's shifting right now, but that's maybe a topic for later or even for another bot but a lot of the strategies that I think we're reserved for Series B are trickling down to Series A companies because they have to diversify way for pay, but maybe more on that later. So I think with SEO, it's like the first pillar I would say is, do you have a unique angle when you take a look at the SEO landscape today, you look at editorial, the landscape, which is to how to searches and who are the players there and what kind of information is being offered? Do you have something unique to contribute to that conversation? Another thing if I have to do an audit checklist, another thing is, do you have a unique programmatic angle, right? For instance, Canva did dealt with templates. Who else is programmatic?

Yuriy Timen (00:18:54):
CWELL, Redfit, obviously all the real estate, right? That's really strong-

Lenny (00:19:00):
Saint Pier.

Yuriy Timen (00:19:01):
Saint Pier, right. So do you have a programmatic angle and then understanding the competitive landscape or the other one is, do you have a unique data angle? So for instance, a company I work with called Monarch Money, which is in the personal finance management space. Think of it as a new and improved version of MIT. There is a lot of users are connecting accounts and you have a sense percenting patterns and things like that. Clearly there is a unique data, and so it's a question of, can you turn it into some kind of valuable organic search experience?

Yuriy Timen (00:19:39):
I won't go into too much detail in terms of what we're thinking of there, but that's another checkbox. If you can check two of those three boxes as a back of the envelope framework, you may be in good shape. And then it's a question of like, "How can you lower the cost of experimentation SEO as much as possible?" I think as a rule of thumb, if you can time box it to three months, what can I do at the end of three months? Is this likely to work or not?

Lenny (00:20:14):
Awesome. Couple follow up questions.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:20:16):
One is SEO feels like this dark art where you need some SEO wizard to come help you through this.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:20:25):
Do you suggest companies find somebody or work with an agency or something else? What's your general feeling on SEO versus some other route?

Yuriy Timen (00:20:33):
I think SEO is pretty specialized skill set. There are some basic principles that always hold like best content wins and don't do shady back linking and make sure that you're on page. SEO is good and your pages are easily crawl, but I feel like everybody knows that. And where the winners are determined are between the lines. Better than a sports' analogy? Maybe you can.

Lenny (00:21:10):
Between the lines. I don't know what that comes from.

Yuriy Timen (00:21:15):
But anyway, what I mean is that there is a lot of more nuance, SEO developments and angles, where I think is where the opportunity really lies to differentiate yourself. And that requires keeping up with the latest algorithm changes. It's very hard to do that unless you are specializing in the art where the black magic of SEO, and so that's why I think getting an outside resource at least for an audit is really helpful. Now, whether it's a boutique agency or a solo consultant, I think that's more circumstantial, but I've found at least with the companies that I've worked with, if we wanted to quickly vet the SEO opportunity, I can do it in a very kind of amateur, at an amateur level.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:02):
Plug things into similar web and try to figure out the right option is there, but you can get these relatively inexpensive audits done from companies that you can then choose. Do I hire them to help with my SEO or not? But I think that audit is usually a very good use of time because they have templates. So what they can turn around for five to 10K would take you many, many human hours to try to pull together yourself.

Lenny (00:22:28):
Awesome. Are there agencies that you want to name that people can go check out or would you prefer just to keep it from having-

Yuriy Timen (00:22:35):
I'll give one plug.

Lenny (00:22:37):
Great.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:37):
I think one of the most innovative, disciplined first principles SEO thinkers and I have met is Ethan Smith from Graphite. It's not for everyone. It's a pretty high end SEO shell. So I wouldn't send the Series a company there, but Ethan also produces a lot of resources and what they've been focusing on at Graphite lately has been actually automating a lot of their work and turning it into SAS. So I don't know how far along they are, but you could probably already get into some of the betas from the tools that they're offering.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Sweet. I'm going to try to get Ethan on this podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:21):
I've seen his stuff and it's awesome.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:23):
Yeah. He is a math scientist when it comes to SEO. Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:25):
We need those. We need math scientist on ship.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:28):
Right.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Okay. So we've talked about virality talked about SEO, paid. Imagine that's pretty straightforward if your LTV are high enough and you can pay back ads on those, then that's where you go. Imagine everyone can try it. Doesn't work for everyone. What if yeah, anything you want to add there?

Yuriy Timen (00:23:43):
I mean, there's a lot. There's a lot. I mean, I don't know how deep you want to go down the paid rabbit hole because it's changing. It's probably the most affected growth bucket in light of the market turbulence, the venture sentiment shifting. I've seen paying acquisition strategies at budgets. They are at the brunt of that fallout. And so the question is where do you want to go there?

Lenny (00:24:16):
Yeah. That's a really good topic. I was saving that for later, but let's chat it better right now.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:20):
I imagine part of this is Apple's tracking changes too.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:22):
So I guess my big question is paid still lucrative and a good path for many companies is like 50% of the time less effective. How do you see that shifting recently? And how should people think about paid in the consumer subscription startup?

Yuriy Timen (00:24:38):
Well, I think in the short term, let's break it down into phases. I think in the short term paid acquisition and just paid media dollars are contracted and we're seeing it already with Metas advertising revenue, Snaps advertising revenue. There's clearly a global contraction happening to paid media budgets. A big part of it is because all of a sudden the definition of efficient acquisition and good payback windows is shifting. So before for a consumer subscription company, 12 month payback was decent. Now it's like, you better pay back your paid media in six months or less. That's the sentiment.

Yuriy Timen (00:25:23):
So the thought is reaction is like anything that's more than six months we're well board of six months, we're cutting that and so there's that. Then there is just less tolerance for ambiguity and attribution when the sentiment is like, "Let's grow at [inaudible 00:25:38]. Grow at all costs." If you can't attribute things perfectly, that's okay. Now it's like, especially with venture back companies, you have to have two plus years of runway, managers burn a lot more diligently now. And so whatever you can't attribute to sales sue like, "That shits got to go." I don't know if we can curse on the pod or not.

Lenny (00:25:59):
Only available-

Yuriy Timen (00:26:03):
Well, I've been holding back for the last 30 minutes. No, I'm kidding.

Lenny (00:26:03):
At least.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:04):
All right.

Lenny (00:26:05):
We're not kid friendly, but nobody's cursed yet. So this could be okay. So you'll be the first.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:09):
All right. Way loud. All right. But anyways, yeah. So I think there is a short term contraction. However, that opens up an opportunity for smart kind of attribution investments. So you're seeing an emergence of some interesting attribution related attribution for incrementality related products. A couple that I personally started exploring and looking into, and then you just see a lot more heads of growth, heads of user acquisition, thinking about attribution in building their attribution stacks. And so I think that once we settle into some kind of new normal, which is going to be a combination of just better attribution stack on average for companies combined with just the level of acceptance, that attribution will never be as good as it maybe once was. We're going to probably get hit. Come out of that and you'll see paid budgets start making their way back. But even right now, during contraction, there are going to be some winners.

Yuriy Timen (00:27:26):
The companies that had strong cash positions, have strong unit economics, strong paid back periods already like Grammarly, Canva to name two that I know personally. A couple of others or many others probably, they're going to be winners because all of a sudden, if previously they were competing with companies who were nowhere as efficient as them, but for whatever reason had the green light to keep spending, now all of those are going to pull back their budgets. And so those that have been disciplined, have the instrumentation to track things better than average. They're going to benefit from decreased competition on app platforms, decreasing CPMs, et cetera. So they're going to do winners for sure.

Lenny (00:28:09):
Wow. Haven't heard this perspective. It's so interesting that the fact that it's gotten harder, it's creating new opportunities for companies to do it better and more intelligently. You said you mentioned a couple tools products that you found to be potentially helpful in this. Is there anything you could mention there?

Yuriy Timen (00:28:22):
Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned a couple that I've kind of connected with in the last couple of months. So first of all, Media Mix Modeling is making a comeback, which is something that kind of got popularized in the math meant kind of advertising era of the fifties, pre-digital, and that's how that was the piece of the methodology. I can't speak of the specifics there. The science is a little bit out of depth there, but it was basically a way to use some data to determine a budget allocation across channels at the time was probably newspapers and billboards, et etcetera.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:03):
It was leveraging data to some extent. You would were doing it maybe on a quarterly basis. And then you would only update it every quarter. There was no way with media mix modeling. There was no way to adjust budget in quarter because you weren't getting the data feedback loop that frequently. But media mix modeling is now making a comeback because there are so many offline channels that are part of folks channel portfolio today and that plus a lot of the online channels are becoming less trackable like Meta for instance, with the iOS 14 shift. And so Media Mix Modeling is going to comeback and the company that's leading the charge of bringing the Media Mix Modeling methodology of the traditional advertising era and ushering it into the digital world is a company called the Recast.

Lenny (00:29:48):
Recast.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:48):
Recast. Yeah. So I've heard really good things. I haven't tried them with any of my companies yet, but there are a couple that are on the horizon hopefully.

Lenny (00:29:58):
Double click there for a moment. Is that still useful if you're not doing TV and other forms of advertising?

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
I think it's still-

Lenny (00:30:04):
You're just doing-

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
Yeah, I think it's useful if you're spending a considerable amount, what's considerable, I'd say worth of a hundred thousand a month update media. And if you have some level of channel complexity, so you're not just like a Google Go or a Facebook, but maybe you're on three plus the channels. Then I think it still makes sense. The other ones in the incremental space, they have very different methodologists actually, because at end of the day, this might be obvious to folks, but maybe some will find value.

Yuriy Timen (00:30:34):
Click based attribution or the digital attribution were all fawning over cookie based and click based, a real parameter based attribution. It never demonstrated a causal relationship between our media spend and business results. It was only good for correlative insights. And the only way to determine causality is through real controlled experiments, randomized control experiments through incrementality testing, which is typically really hard to do cleanly and also companies have always been often wary about doing it because you have to turn off a channel potentially in a key demo and you're like, "Yeah." The benefit is to learning of whether it's actually incremental, but the cost or the sales that I will lose today. But the only way to really know how effective your paid media is through ongoing incrementality testing. So there are two companies that are addressing that. Two that I'm excited about. One is measured, can be found, measured.call, amazing domain name.

Lenny (00:31:44):
Amazing domain name, go with that.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:45):
And then the other one is incremental, but incremental-

Lenny (00:31:50):
Outcome.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:51):
... no vows except the last A between the T and the L.

Lenny (00:31:57):
Excellent, great job.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:58):
So many free plugs today.

Lenny (00:32:00):
Yeah. I love it. That's great. This is what people need. They're just like, "Okay, what do I actually do"? And so the more it's clear what to actually try and how to solve these problems. The more people can actually make change. I had a couple questions here that I wanted to follow up on. One is founders might be listening to this and they're like, "Amazing. Okay, we're going to grow. There's three ways to grow. Let's do it all. Get someone on SEO to get Jane on paid. Let's get Fred on virality."

Yuriy Timen (00:32:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:32:32):
So in your experience, is it smart to focus on one and then expand down the road or try them all see which one works best? How do you advise companies think about these options?

Yuriy Timen (00:32:44):
I would say focus paired with rapid iterations, right? With limited resources. Naturally you have to practice some form of essentialism and ruthless prioritization, but at the same time, the clock is always ticking. You can not burn. That there is a finite number of tries that you have at finding what works, right? What's going to help you unlock the next level of growth, get to the next funding round, extend your runway. And so I think either one taking to an extreme focus or trying multiple things is not a good thing. And just in case, it's not obvious if you focus on one thing and it ends up being the wrong thing, you've wasted really valuable time and now you have so much less time left to find something that does work. Spreading yourself very thin oftentimes in the early stage companies, it's one person who's in charge of all of growth, but they also have some other kind of responsibilities like maybe ops and customer success.

Yuriy Timen (00:33:54):
If you get them to try five different things, they may not try them anyone individually fully enough, because I like to say the only thing that's worse than a channel or a tactic that you tried not working. The only thing that's worse now is when you didn't give it the appropriate shot and you pretty much surely or erroneously concluded that it doesn't work. And it's remarkable how often you find that to be the case when I talk to companies, "Oh, YouTube, we tried it doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay, can I see what you've tried?" And then you look at it and you're like, "Oh, this thing was not designed to even have a shot at working from the get go." So to answer your question, I think it's focus with some guard rails so that you know exactly when it's time to move on to the next thing.

Lenny (00:34:51):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B Testing platform built by Airbnb alums for Modern Growth Teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

Lenny (00:35:21):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I love about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. Geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:36:01):
This might be too hard to answer in a chat like this, but do you have any guidance for how to know when you've gone far enough? I imagine there's a lot nuance and detail there. Is there anything that you could share?

Yuriy Timen (00:36:12):
Love the question. It's very thought provoking. I think with some tactics and some channels you can fairly objectively create some test guard rails where it's like, if it's YouTube, we know kind of minimum number of impressions that you got to get. Try two to three creative angles. Here's the click through rates range that you're looking for. If you get within these ranges on these KPIs, keep going. If you don't, abandon.

Yuriy Timen (00:36:48):
I think that's important to also know that abandonment doesn't mean we will never revisit it again, right? It just means that because every time you're evaluating, the concept of sunk cost. So you have these periodic, I think periods of reevaluation where it's like, "Okay, did we try enough? Is this more art than science frankly." It's like, "What's the incremental lift for us as a team to try to experiment with the next phase of this channel or this tactic? What is the opportunity cost of that? What are the other high profile things that we could be trying?" You were right and save this topic too hard to answer in this format, but I would break things down maybe into two types. There are some channels or tactics where you can objectively figure out som guard rails for when it's showing promise or not, because you can pull benchmarks on good click through rates and things like that. Then there are other tactics where you just have to exercise more judgment outside of benchmarks.

Lenny (00:37:54):
Yeah. Yeah. That was actually really valuable and very challenging question to try to summarize quickly so thank you. One more quick question along these lines. So you talked about these three broad ways companies grow. Oftentimes a couple of them work, something I've seen and I'm curious if you agree, usually one is like 80% of your growth and then you layer on a couple more to optimize. Is that what you see?

Yuriy Timen (00:38:18):
Yes. I think companies that we know and admire and reference in case studies or in podcast, such as this one. From the outside looking in, you oftentimes assume that it's a highly diversified growth engine. I have to say it's often not the case. Definitely the 80/20 applies. There is a kind of strategy that's working overwhelmingly well, and there is a scramble internally to minimize reliance on that one thing. And on the discover slash on the walk, the next step function, the next growth horizon. In the case of Grammarly, it was performance marketing kind of over reliance on performance marketing during part of the company's life cycle. And so it was like, "Okay, this thing is working." It's efficient so you don't want to stop pouring fire on it, but you're also thinking months and years ahead, what kind of risk does it open you up to?

Yuriy Timen (00:39:35):
And so there is a scramble to fight and at Grammarly, it's been successful there. With Canva, it was the SEO angle. So for them, that was working really well, which is more defensible than paid. That's sort of long tail programmatic SEO angle, but look, you're always susceptible to Google algorithm updates and so how do you derisk yourself from that? But to your point, yes. And I think that surprising thing to people probably is that it's also the case with some later stage companies. It's not just early stage companies that are kind of one trick pulleys. Sometimes it's later stage companies as well.

Lenny (00:40:11):
This makes me think about is there's kind of these three phases to growth. There's the kickstart phase where you're just doing a bunch of stuff, trying to get things moving. Then there's that you discover your first main growth engine and then there's layer on additional engines because you want to diversify.

Yuriy Timen (00:40:25):
Yep. And one interesting, what I believe is an interesting period and a lot of it is gut feel, right? And I try to direct companies. I encounter sometimes early stage companies is when one thing is working well and they're already worried about over reliance and they're starting to talk about diversification and I come in all the times and I see showing up in their OKRs. I come, "No, no. Too early. I'm glad that you're such a forward thinker. Put all of your energy. Sure, this one tactic is accounting for say 80 plus percent of your new user acquisition, but your user acquisition is still small. So don't get distracted with diversification. We'll get there. Lean more into this, hit this growth rates, stand this up. Build this into a real strategic advantages thing that's working."

Yuriy Timen (00:41:17):
So I actually have to talk them out, focusing on diversification too early. Contrast that with some later stage companies for who are... At scale, I know 50 plus million ARR, 90 plus percent reliant on a single acquisition channel, which just mire with risk and diversification is a blind spot for them. And then with those, I have to be like, "Hey y'all. Here's the risk that you're carrying. Let's start carving out bandwidth resources to try to go and explore these other channels with tactics."

Lenny (00:41:49):
That's such an important point. It reminds me Casey has this hilarious line that he uses that the money's always in the banana stand or there's always more money in the banana stand from [inaudible 00:41:59] development. That basically your growth is probably going to come from the same place it's already come from.

Yuriy Timen (00:42:03):
Yep.

Lenny (00:42:04):
And that you shouldn't take that for granted. And you should put most of your efforts into continuing to optimize that versus being distracted by, "Oh, let's do SEO now."

Yuriy Timen (00:42:11):
I see that argument for sure.

Lenny (00:42:13):
So you mentioned at this point about how later stage growth strategies are starting to move earlier into growth strategy planning. I'd love to hear more on that.

Yuriy Timen (00:42:22):
Yeah. Let me expand on that in the world that we lived in last 18 months, or let's say up until say three to five months ago. We were living in a world where funding was abundant and plentiful, startups were conditions to think that they could raise twice a year. Valuations were quite toppling within a year. You raise in January and then you raise in November and your valuation five X. And so companies were coming off of these ridiculous Series As of 15 to 25 million dollar As and they were like, "We got to grow as quickly as possible. What can we activate to give us immediate return?" And the answer is almost always paid. That one going to give you, especially if you're think you want to go back to raising less than 12 months later, that forces you to focus on very kind of short term tactics, short payoff tactics.

Yuriy Timen (00:43:28):
And so things that SEO, there was no room to think about that for early stage companies. Because payoff is going to come maybe in 12 months in terms of meaningful payoff. We care about getting to the next round and maximizing our valuation between now and then. SEO is for the grown up companies. When we're that we could think about it. And they were getting the reinforcement from everywhere, from peers, from VCs. It's like it's growth, growth, growth. The growth at any cause.

Yuriy Timen (00:44:02):
I think what happened now and we'll see where things stabilized because I think we're still in the midst of a little bit of chaos. What's happening now is the same VCs are saying, "Okay, it's now survival." You have to extend your runway, minimize burn, high burning if you have to. And all of a sudden growth, whether explicitly or via inference becomes kind of a secondary objective, especially for all these companies that are far from being cash flow positive. They have to figure out how to stay alive, but not have to go back to the market and be sort of a victim of shitty terms. And so I feel this is me extrapolating because venture capitalist didn't actually tell me this, but I'm extrapolating that growth is a secondary objective now. It's really focusing on sustainability due to economics, accepting your runway control your destiny, getting to default life.

Yuriy Timen (00:45:00):
And all of a sudden it's like, "Okay. Plus paid is a lot less attractive now. Can't afford to be acquiring users at like LTV cap one to one." That's now a no-no. And so SEO is now becoming more attractive because once you got your burn under control and you're thinking, "Okay, we saved all this money by reducing our paid budget. We're cutting it entirely. How do we put some of those resources back to work?" And all of a sudden SEO starts looking a lot more lucrative because it's almost like you took the urgency of grow at any cost in the next six months, you took that out of the equation. So now it's like we're in a position where we don't have to go back to raising 12, 18, 24 months. We have 18, 24 months worth of runway and now companies are starting to think more in terms of building more sort of sustainable and defensible growth initiatives.

Lenny (00:46:02):
Fascinating. And as much as people may want to do SEO, like we talked about earlier, doesn't mean they will be able to pull it off because there's these things that have to be approved for your type of company and-

Yuriy Timen (00:46:12):
Yes.

Lenny (00:46:12):
Yeah. Going back to point you made earlier about paid being a really interesting opportunity right now because it's become harder. Would you say generally you're kind of like pro, tri paid, go paid be in this time because I'm finding a lot of startups are like, "Oh, we can't do paid anymore. We're trying all these other approaches to grow." Is that like alpha right now? Start thinking about paid in a creative way and maybe this is going to be a huge advantage.

Yuriy Timen (00:46:35):
So there are two pieces to do paid. I mean I'm oversimplifying, but I think people will hopefully appreciate the over the oversimplification. Number one, because it actually drives returns at efficient unit economic, whatever that may mean for your company, your business, your industry. The other way to do it is because it's a very quick way to get learnings on messaging and positioning on designs on features. You're thinking of launching et cetera, right? It's hard to get faster learnings at scale than A/B testing headlines, Google search or whatever. I think the problem that I find is when a company can't have which camper in or where they try to say that they're in both, but really it's like, "Okay, you're funneling a hundred K a month." It's super inefficient and they're not even running experiments to actually get the learnings. I can assess the company, even if I don't download the industry as well, based on just seeing their funnel performance, their conversion rates, their retention curves, their LTDs, understanding their churn.

Yuriy Timen (00:47:43):
I could say whether they stand the chance at making paid work as a former strategy. So not just the learning mechanism, not just the kind of a feedback engine, but actually a profitable at delivering acquisition channel or strategy. And if I see that they're not there because the funnel doesn't convert well, the users don't retain the LTDs are too low. Then I say, "Hey, it's not time for paid. Maybe car on a little bit of budget if you want to quickly test positioning and things like that. But it's just too soon." But instead I encounter a company that's really healthy conversion rates, strong LTDs. I do a little bit of competitor research and I can see where the opportunities are, which channels are less saturated than others. Then I may say, "Hey, it's worth it. It's worth a go." And also just seeing the bigger picture of their financial health, how much runway do you have? What does your monthly burn look like?

Lenny (00:48:41):
Right? Because paids like cash going out the door and it will return hopefully at some point might be six months might be a year, and so that's a real constraint. You mentioned onboarding and funnel conversion. Two questions there. One, do you have a heuristic of here's good for conversion rates? Is there something that you think about there that you could share or is it very case dependent?

Yuriy Timen (00:49:03):
I think it's case dependent, but yeah, it is. It's not case dependent. It's category dependent. So it's not that every company is so case, but it's like, we got to know about what buckets we're talking about. I will say that... Let's say we talk about prosumer premium SAS, ala Grammarly, ala Canva, Whimsical, InVideo, things like that. Yeah. I can confidently say a healthy website visit to a free user, a free account creation conversion rate. It's probably in that 20 to 35% range.

Lenny (00:49:43):
From landing on the site to signing up?

Yuriy Timen (00:49:45):
From landing on site to a free user at scale. Earlier stage, you have strong product market fit with some kind of small audience segment that conversion can be 40 to 50%, but as you go broader, it'll probably asymptote at like 25, 30%. What about a conversion if you're premium from a free user to a premium account or paying account? I think anything under 5% is not going to work long term, regardless of how big your top of funnel is. You may get the soft point, but for you to remain an independent company continuously growing pre IPO, I don't think it's going to happen. It's got to be north of 5%, ideally like more than 7%.

Lenny (00:50:39):
Wow. Super handy. On the onboarding point, what's your thoughts on investing in onboarding and that part foe of how often is that a fruitful area of investment?

Yuriy Timen (00:50:49):
Almost always. A lot of my work is in that sort of a prosumer space. So the products tend to be more complex. Airtable, whimsical, Canva, InVideo. They're very robust products. And so it's very easy to get lost in their editors. I think what all of those companies are trying to do for their respective verticals and use cases is they're trying to democratize access to fades that previously you have to rely on professionals for. Maybe in the case of bayer team bot, it's your engineers. In the case of PM bot, it is professional graphic designers. In the case of a video, it's professional video editors. So when they're trying to democratize access, but they're also trying to make the products robust enough to be comparable to a professional great quality. And it's a very difficult place to play it, right? It's like, how do you make it simple enough where a nonprofessional can use it, but robust enough where they go and say, "Oh yeah, this is as good as if I would've hired a professional fill in the blank."

Yuriy Timen (00:52:19):
And that's where onboarding, sorry for the long answer. That's where onboarding is really, really important because there's such a huge difference between landing someone on that initial editor page, be it Airtable, Canva having that left to their own devices versus getting as much information or as much relevant information front and then customizing that landing experience for them. So that if they're there to do X and we know XYZ about them, we're able to guide them and not expose them to the robustness of the product all at once. So the short answer is almost all the time onboarding is a big opportunity.

Lenny (00:53:04):
Awesome. That's what I was expecting to hear, to give folks some context. What's kind of an order magnitude that you've seen improvement on onboarding and maybe impact on a company improving onboarding.

Yuriy Timen (00:53:15):
Earlier stage companies where still haven't really approached the local maximal, but you haven't experimented with a ton of things. I mean, you can two to four X activation rates easily through onboarding. I think later stage companies like maybe Series B beyond, I think you can still probably get to 20 to 30% lift at activations. It depends on how many low hanging fruit are left to tackle.

Lenny (00:53:46):
That makes sense. Yeah. Till the onboarding, there's always money in the onboarding banana stand. On that kind of same idea, do you have a general feeling of investments in this stuff often pays off and helps you grow and is often higher ROI and investments in bucket B are rarely successful. What would those two buckets be?

Yuriy Timen (00:54:07):
So thinking of investments rawly, right? Not just monetarily.

Lenny (00:54:13):
Yeah. Yeah. Time and resources.

Yuriy Timen (00:54:15):
Yeah. I mean, I would say that getting to know your customer always pays off. So it's user interviews and getting to know your market, your customers, and your prospects always pays off. Customer research, inside surveying, interviewing panels incredibly useful. And I found that to be very especially early stages. The amount of clarity at momentum that it can create inside of a seed Series A up to Series B company when you first do some proper research push. The way it can galvanize the team and give them focus and clarity and purpose is remarkable. So that always pays off. What doesn't pay off? I mean, I think over reliance on paid, it comes to bite you in the rear end. When I think about tracking an attribution, I think it's a question of the right level of investment at the right stage.

Yuriy Timen (00:55:19):
Rarely do companies get it right. They usually fall into one of two buckets where they underinvest in attribution and they are now, their budgets are up high. They have a broad channel portfolio and they have a hard time figuring out what's working, what isn't and they just get into this inertia. It's like, "Well, overall, the company's been growing and it's been growing roughly over the same time that we've been increasing our spend. We're scared to break it. So we're just going to keep spending." Or companies that read horror stories about other companies overspending. They sometimes try to invest in attribution too much, believe it or not where they're trying to get everything perfect and scientifically pure. But what they don't realize is that the payoff may not always be there. And so how do I fit this into your question of, I think tracking attribution incrementality is definitely a worthwhile investment arena, but it could both be a good or bad depending on the level. So you got to make sure the level investment is appropriate for your stage when you stand to aim for-

Lenny (00:56:35):
Awesome. You're such a good interviewee that you come back to the question.

Yuriy Timen (00:56:39):
No, that I promise.

Lenny (00:56:40):
That was great. Okay. One last question. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I'd love you to get your thoughts on advertising on TikTok and YouTube and broadly is there any other tactics, avenues that you think are kind of underutilized or emerging that folks should be thinking about?

Yuriy Timen (00:56:58):
Yeah. So TikTok, one thing I'll say about TikTok is I'm seeing it come up more and more as a channel that works well. And sometimes even the most efficient channel, most efficient digital channel for some brands. But I think that the thing about TikTok that oftentimes I was surprised about is you often hear, "Oh, TikTok that's for the 15 to 22 year olds." I'm bad with my gens Z and oh, my audience is different. So I'm just going to ignore the champ. TikTok has so many users and it's still so relatively unsaturated with advertisers that your audience is on there. You'd be surprised.

Yuriy Timen (00:57:46):
I've worked with brands that their core demo is like 40 plus married making 200K plus in household annual income. And you wouldn't think that demo is on TikTok and it is. So what point about TikTok? Other channels, I think out at home is still not getting enough love. Podcasts? Okay. Yep, yep.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Spots through this one. I recall you heard it from Yuriy.

Yuriy Timen (00:58:17):
Direct mail, what has happened? They've gotten better with attribution because before a lot of those channels were written off as sort of attribution is just too hard on there and attribution is so good and reliable on digital. So that's that gap that canyon that existed in attribution capabilities of online and offline, deterred a lot of people from offline. Today offline has gotten better and actually positioning themselves as being able to do attribution, but also online attribution is deteriorated. So all of a sudden that argument kind of slimmed out a little bit and I'm seeing offline get a lot more traction and in podcasts, especially are actually very, very performant for a lot of brands. Those are a couple of things that come to mind.

Lenny (00:59:11):
Those are great. Happy to hear the podcast piece. Excellent. And then I actually, I'm an investor in a startup that Databig at a home campaign and they just told me that it was a 10 to one positive ROI on the deals that they got out of it. So I've been seeing that too, and that's such a good point that the measurement and attribution online has come down where it maybe makes more sense to try stuff like that. Amazing. All right. Are you ready for our very exciting lightning round? I'm going to ask you five questions I think, and then just, yeah, let's go through it quick.

Yuriy Timen (00:59:44):
Let's do it.

Lenny (00:59:45):
Let's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Yuriy Timen (00:59:50):
Ooh, that's something that I think is very wrong to recency bias, right? It's like, what are some of the books you've read recently that you've enjoyed? But I would say there are a couple of books that stuck with me over the years. I think on the business side, where on the business side productivity side, it's a book called Essentialism. I forget the author's name. I think his last name is McKeown or something. And it's basically the book about cutting out the noise and finding a singular focus and doing that really well. It's a book that was a game changer for me at Grammarly being sort of new in my career, having really aggressive goals, not being scared to say no. Taking on a lot, just feel it thinking like, "Well, I'm only working 12 hours a day. There's 12 more left. I can do it."

Yuriy Timen (01:00:45):
And then when you end up stepping into a leadership role, which happened for me, I mean, that happened prior to grounded, but really I was able to grow into that role at Grammarly. That book was incredible and I used it a lot. I pretty much got copies for everybody on the team, like 40 plus people. So that is a book I swear by.

Yuriy Timen (01:01:06):
I read a lot outside of work and business. So I don't know if it's appropriate, but I'll say that. It's Frankl's, A Man's Search for Meaning is just a remarkable memoir on perseverance and I think that biggest takeaway is you can't control what's happening around you, but you can control your reaction to it. And then I'd say the book that I read recently, because I was very affected by the Russia invasion of Ukraine. I'm originally from Ukraine. I believe you are as well. So it hit very close to home and there have been a lot of references drawn between the President's Zelensky and his response in the war and Winston Churchill's response in 1941 when Hitler started marching through Europe. And so I read a book called I think The Splendid and the Vile by Eric Larson.

Lenny (01:02:02):
Yeah. I read that. I read that.

Yuriy Timen (01:02:03):
Did you also read it since the invasion?

Lenny (01:02:06):
No, it was before that, but I totally get that now.

Yuriy Timen (01:02:09):
Reading it right now because I've been following the conflict very closely, but for people who haven't followed the conflict or maybe have only followed the rush, the war kind of in a cursory way, you can put what's happening into historical context remarkably well. So I feel like that book accomplishes two things. Number one, it's like you learned something about not so distant history that maybe you didn't know, which was about Great Britain and Winston Churchill kind of courageous response in the face of Hitler's invasion of Europe. But you also can draw so many parallels to what's happening today. And hopefully that helps us understand what's at stake, not to end on two grandiose of a note.

Lenny (01:02:57):
We'll go less grandiose quickly, but I will add one thing that stood out in that book that is also true in the Ukraine is how during the fire bombing of Britain, people are just going out every day, going to clubs, still having-

Yuriy Timen (01:03:09):
I know. Steal them their life.

Lenny (01:03:11):
And same thing even today in Ukraine is.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:14):
And not just keep, but it's very life.

Lenny (01:03:17):
I love that. Okay. We'll move on to less, less serious stuff maybe. What a transition to, what's your favorite other podcast?

Yuriy Timen (01:03:27):
Honestly, there's only one other podcast that I'll listen to right now because I've just been so consumed. I listened to a lot of live streams and read a lot about the conflict, which has taken up so much of my head space. That's not work related, but I would say that the All in Pod. I feel like it's a cool way for me to just catch up on everything that's going on through their unique filter.

Lenny (01:03:50):
Yeah.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:50):
That's probably the-

Lenny (01:03:52):
Cool. Yeah. I learned a lot.

Yuriy Timen (01:03:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:53):
I learned a lot from that one. That's so much drama on that show. Okay. Great. Favorite recent movie or TV show. Anything stand out.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:00):
So that's another thing. Since February I've watched nothing. My Netflix skew just keeps growing because they keep emailing me saying this new season is out. I'm like, "Oh yeah. I used to that show. Let me add it to the queue." I mean, recently I had some downtime. The kids were with grandma, so I watch movie Hustle with Adam Sandler.

Lenny (01:04:22):
Love that. So good.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:23):
Yeah. It was good. It was it's very light. It's not like a movie that's going to make you think a lot, but it was just good old entertainment. Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:31):
I like that. I like that summary. Yeah, it was so delightful. Maybe one more question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader? Maybe someone people may not know or if anyone else comes to mind.

Yuriy Timen (01:04:43):
That's a very good question. So I would say first off, I do believe that some of the brightest minds, honestly, in any craft are people that you never hear because it takes a certain personality, energy, and probably a lot of other circumstances to invest in your personal brand. And also it's very hard to do that while still staying relevant as a practitioner. I mean, when I think about myself two years ago before starting advising, I was just kind of living in my Grammarly cave. And I felt like I was probably at the top of my craft, but I didn't have time to pick my head up or not, maybe not even just tie, but I didn't know where to start to pick my head up and do something like this. I would say some people that, I mean, I mentioned Ethan in terms of SEO. SEO and just organic growth loops and content as a growth engine, he is best in class.

Yuriy Timen (01:05:49):
Who else? So Mark Fisk, he shows up in the Reforge chats a lot. He was leading growth and marketing at Credit Karma for a while. And right now he's an investor I think at the HRG Capital, but he is a really, really strong thought leader on all things, performance marketing attribution, and just kind of paid acquisition at large. Those are two people that I make sure I... And there are others of course, but those are two who I make sure I stay in touch with at least on a quarterly basis because any casual catch up just yield so many unique nuggets.

Lenny (01:06:25):
Amazing. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuriy Timen (01:06:31):
Honestly, I don't have a very strong online presence. I would say LinkedIn is probably the only place where I seek things the recent, so folks can find me there. They can also find me inside of Lenny's Newsletter. I do. I do. I do, but you can appearance there once in a while and on that's odd.

Lenny (01:06:53):
True.

Yuriy Timen (01:06:54):
How folks can be helpful to me, honestly, promote and shout out of Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Pod and that if you're building awesome things, come talk to me. I always carve out some amount of time in my life just for noncommercial things, just to have conversations with founders and spent 30 minutes with them on a phone, expecting nothing in return and maybe save them some time from making some of the mistakes that I've made and help direct them on a more path. So it's about it.

Lenny (01:07:27):
Amazing. You are awesome. Thank you so much for making the time to do this. I learned a ton. I can't wait to get this episode out. There's just so much meat to this thing,

Yuriy Timen (01:07:36):
Dude this was good.

Yuriy Timen (01:07:37):
I feel like my nervousness was unfounded. This was super organic. You are just as welcoming as you are outside of the pod. So yeah. Thanks for having me.

# Lessons from Airtable’s unconventional growth strategy | Zoelle Egner

## Transcript

Zoelle Egner (00:00:00):
There is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:00:35):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
Lenny (00:01:02):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Zoelle Egner. Zoelle was one of the earliest employees at Airtable, where she led their early marketing and customer success teams, and generally just helped Airtable grow into the legendary business that it is today. She also spent time in Box. She's advised dozens of startups on marketing and growth, and is now head of marketing and growth at a startup called Block Party. 
(00:01:32):
In our conversation, Zoelle shares how to punch above your weight as a startup, the most effective and impactful growth and marketing tactics throughout Airtable's history, including their use of billboards, marketing investments that are often high ROI, and those that are rarely a good use of time, why PR and launches are actually useful to startups, and also when they aren't, and a lot more. It was so much fun chatting with Zoelle, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Zoelle Egner after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(00:02:03):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences, from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SMTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like, "Error on line 53." And never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.
(00:03:10):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach, so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

Zoelle Egner (00:04:12):
Hi, thanks for having me.
Lenny (00:04:14):
It's very much my pleasure. Something that is pretty cool is that we actually met in my newsletter Slack community. I actually looked this up of how we actually started chatting, and it was me cold DMing you to get a discount on Airtable for the newsletter subscribers. And you very happily got me that, hooked us up, and then you became a go-to Airtable person for advice on what Airtable did right and wrong over the years. And so thank you for being that person and also I'm really excited to have you on this podcast and to learn from you.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:43):
I am super excited to chat.
Lenny (00:04:45):
Awesome. You're probably best known for your time at Airtable, which, correct me if I'm wrong, you're employee number 11.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:53):
That's right.
Lenny (00:04:55):
Okay, and at Airtable you led marketing, you led the customer success teams, so we're going to chat about all that stuff. But before we get into that, I want to chat briefly about this other project that you worked on, that from the outside felt like a really fascinating thing, and a really impactful project, and a really cool team. And it's called Vaccinate California, I think, is that how you pronounce it?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
Mm-hmm.
Lenny (00:05:13):
See, I just-
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
VaccinateCA.
Lenny (00:05:15):
VaccinateCA. Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about what this was? What were you trying to do? What was the impact you had? How did it all go?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:21):
Yeah, absolutely. So VaccinateCA existed to help people in California find and get a COVID vaccine as quickly as possible, and that sounds really trivial right now, but you have to wind back to January of 2020, when vaccines were first coming out, and it was really hard. So just as a reminder, because most of us have blocked that from our memory. 
Lenny (00:05:40):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:05:41):
The federal and state systems didn't really exist yet, and so everything was this horrible hodgepodge, where eligibility depended on not only what state you were in, it was down to the county, and even sometimes the individual facility. You would be at a Walgreens, and talk to them, and they'd be like, "Oh, you have to be over 65, and also in one of these 12 categories of employment in order to get the vaccine." And then you'd go a mile away and they would tell you something totally different. So people would stand in line for hours. There were phones going off the hook, utterly madness, and really, really scary for a lot of people who were trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe. 
Lenny (00:06:17):
Yeah, I remember those days well.
Zoelle Egner (00:06:19):
Yeah. So this organization was founded essentially by a tweet by Patrick McKenzie, for those of you who are on Hacker News Patio11. And he had basically this really simple premise, which is, "If you call a pharmacist, and you ask them who they can give a vaccine to, and what vaccine they have, and then you put that answer on a map, someone else doesn't have to make the same phone call. And that takes lots of pressure also as a healthcare system and also helps people to match supply and demand." 
(00:06:47):
So surprisingly, somehow, that tweet, which is essentially like, "Call people, put in spreadsheet, put online," turned into an entire, full nonprofit that was mostly on Discord, Zoom, Airtable, and not only had this entire hundreds of volunteers who were making phone calls in the state of California and eventually, actually, nationally, we became Vaccinate The States eventually, we were also doing this thing called web banking. So we would go and scrape all the official sources as they started coming out, and then validate them because they were not always correct. And eventually we had the most comprehensive database and map of locations in the entire country, including more comprehensive than the federal government and most of the states because they had really complicated limitations on what they could and couldn't publish based on some relationships they had. We didn't have those limitations.
(00:07:37):
So it meant that we became this clearing house, essentially, for this information and we built an API. We were working directly with Google. And if you ever looked up vaccine locations on Google Maps, that was us feeding that to them, which was really cool. And we also made maps you could see on county websites, so it would help you understand what was available in your area. One of the coolest things that I've ever worked on.
Lenny (00:08:01):
Okay, exactly. That's exactly I imagined how epic this was. Just to make sure people understand what you're describing, basically you had hundreds of people sitting there on phones calling vaccine locations, getting the specifics of who is able to get a vaccine there, and then just giving people a pointer of where they can get a vaccine.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:18):
Exactly. So I came in initially, a colleague of mine at Airtable had been helping out with the building out of the backend. And they started getting media attention. And they thought, "Oh, well this will help more people understand that this resource is available." So I got brought in to do some PR help, basically help them figure out how to get the word out, and then ended up actually quitting my job at Airtable to work on it full-time.
Lenny (00:08:40):
Oh wow.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:41):
Yeah, I was on the board and also managing all outreach and other stuff. So we did lots of really cool education, helping people understand their eligibility at all. Built a bunch of fun tools for that as well, but it was a pretty incredible six months, where we filled a really critical gap in the infrastructure of the country. 
Lenny (00:08:58):
It's wild that was the best solution, is just call people and create your own. 
Zoelle Egner (00:09:03):
You know?
Lenny (00:09:03):
I imagine there was, at Airtable, were you using to store the data?
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
Oh yes. 
Lenny (00:09:07):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
We built an entire insane database, and then eventually custom software on top of that, to make the people who are making the phone calls more easily get the information in. It was a whole thing. Very cool to see, though, not just tech people get involved. We had, in our volunteer base, people from absolutely every walk of life, not just in California, globally. I remember there was a volunteer who said that he decided to join, he was based in Israel, and he had had no trouble getting the vaccine whatsoever, but seen something on Twitter about it, and just decided he wanted to make sure that people were able to get the vaccine as easily as he did. And he spent dozens of hours calling folks, even though he was in a totally different time zone. But really lovely to see all these different people, retired teachers. I think we had a bunch of 12 year olds who were helping out on the code, of all things, all who just really wanted to make sure that they could keep their community safe.
Lenny (00:10:02):
What happened with this organization? It's a nonprofit that now continues to run or what's happening?
Zoelle Egner (00:10:06):
No, we did something which is not common. We actually decided to shut it down after six months. Partially, that's because the existing system finally caught up. And frankly we didn't want to be in a place where we were pulling away resources that could be put towards other things that are going to be more impactful. We always saw ourselves as a stop gap, and once we got to the place where we felt like we weren't really being additive, we wanted to get people's time back, so they could work on other things. So it doesn't exist anymore. I think you can still go check out the archive. We found some researchers who are doing interesting research on it, because there's very fascinating data in there about the equitability of some of the distribution of the vaccine based on where it was available, but the organization is gone. We had that beautiful moment in time and have all moved on. Hoping we don't have to get the band back together, because hopefully it's not necessary anymore.
Lenny (00:10:58):
Oh, man. I'm watching The Last of Us right now about this-
Zoelle Egner (00:11:02):
Mushroom people.
Lenny (00:11:03):
... mushroom based disease, and that scares me now. 
Zoelle Egner (00:11:06):
Yep.
Lenny (00:11:06):
Anyway, on this podcast I try to get to things people learn from these experiences, and so I have to ask what you learn about forming something like this, just ad hoc, pulling a bunch of people together, and having them focus, and get things done, or just scaling it, or even shutting down. I guess what have you taken away from that experience that you maybe will bring to either future one-off things like this or even just your work in general?
Zoelle Egner (00:11:31):
Yeah, I'd say probably three things. One, the incredible power of a simple idea to bring people together. One of the reasons why VaccinateCA was so powerful and got so many people to help is everybody immediately understood why it would be useful and how they specifically could be making a difference. And combining those two things was an incredible way to bring a lot of people on board very quickly, because from a messaging perspective, messaging, something very important to me as a marketer, it was so concise. Like, "Pick up phone, help save lives." Really straightforward. People really, really got that. It allowed them to feel like they had agency in a time when everything felt really, really out of control. I think there's a lot of opportunities we have to activate our communities and give people that sense of control that are both going to be helpful more broadly for society, but also just for those individuals as well to make them feel a little bit more safe, a little bit more like they can actually have a difference in things. 
(00:12:34):
I think in tech we often don't jump into these problems. This was not sophisticated technology. It was phones, Discord, and Airtable mostly being used like a spreadsheet. It wasn't anything wild. Even that very simple infrastructure was enough to make a huge difference. And we have some evidence that we saved a lot of lives as a result of it, which is pretty special. I think part of it is also just saying, "We don't have to be hesitant to jump into these problems. It's important to engage with experts in the field, is not to say that tech solutionism is always the answer." And again, this is not super sophisticated technology, but because we were able to go in and talk to the people who are actually affected, get into the system that already existed, and make something really simple, really fast, it actually did have a huge difference and that's really exciting.
Lenny (00:13:24):
Just to double-click on that one, actually reminds me, some founders of companies I've invested in, I often hear how much easier it is for companies that have a mission that people are excited about for them to hire versus companies that don't. And so it's a really good reminder of just the power of having a mission and a vision that is really compelling to people versus some B2B software that people aren't [inaudible 00:13:47] excited about, even though there's a great reason to have great B2B software. Love B2Bs.
Zoelle Egner (00:13:50):
There are. I love great B2B software. I've spent most of my career on it. But I agree with you. I think if you have an authentic mission and people aren't just like, "Oh, sure, okay. You're connecting the world." But really it's some telephony startup. Like, "Okay."
Lenny (00:13:50):
Yeah. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:05):
If people feel like it's genuinely authentic to what you're building, it can be incredibly meaningful.
Lenny (00:14:11):
Yeah. I just remember a founder who, he is a second company, because the first company did not have an amazing mission. The second one did. And like, "Wow. So much easier to hire for this new startup."
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:14:20):
So totally get that. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Absolutely. 
Lenny (00:14:22):
Okay, number two and three.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:23):
Number two and three, I'll try and be more brief. 
Lenny (00:14:25):
It's all good.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:26):
Number two, I would say just the importance of relentlessly repeating the exact same stuff over and over again, even if you feel like everyone definitely knows. This is something that I've seen play out in every single leadership role that I've had, but it was never more acute than here, particularly because we had this broad coalition of hundreds of people with very different backgrounds. Some people coming to the meeting, some people not, whatever else. I think I repeated the same three talking points about why what we were doing mattered 5,000 times. Cannot overemphasize how many times I said the same stuff, and so did every other member of the board. It really is important and people will fill in the blanks with totally wild things if you don't continuously have that discipline of repeating yourself. You just have to get used to saying the same stuff. And if you do it correctly, it's super motivating. Even if you're sitting there being like, oh my gosh, "I have to say it again." it's worth it.
Lenny (00:15:22):
This reminds me, I don't know where I saw this, it's just in my head right now, that the CEO and founder's job, their actual title is repeater in chief.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:22):
It absolutely should be.
Lenny (00:15:31):
It resonates. Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:31):
I've worked with some leaders who never wanted to. They're like, "No, this is going to be boring for people." And you just have to be like, "Honestly, most people are never listening as much as you think that they are."
Lenny (00:15:39):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:39):
"We wish that they would. But you have to say it 12 different ways in writing, and out loud, and all this other stuff. You're never as important as you think you are, unfortunately, when it comes to that." 
Lenny (00:15:48):
Oh, these are great lessons. Okay. What else do you tell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:15:51):
I think my last learning was really about the power of having a laughably small MVP for something. By the end of this, we were covering the entire United States. We had an API, we had custom software on the front end, this whole behemoth of stuff that we got to in four months or something. In the beginning it was truly, basically, a spreadsheet, and phones, and that was it. Even that, for the first few weeks while we were getting the rest of the infrastructure really going, not only had tremendous impact at one of the most important parts in the pandemic, but also gave us so much information about we actually needed to build that was going to be helpful. And I remember having all of these assumptions about what was going to be necessary to manage this coalition of people to make sure that we had really good data quality.
(00:16:41):
Because one of the most important things you can do if you're trying to be a trusted source of truth is actually have the correct information. Sounds trivial, it's not at all at that scale. And I was totally wrong about all my assumptions. I thought we were going to have to have totally different types of oversight. I thought we were going to have totally different tooling. And it turned out we could do something way lighter weight that would allow us to move much faster as the regulatory landscape kept changing, as all the rule making at individual places kept changing. And that agility, that willingness to do just the smallest possible thing is obviously a little bit of a trope in the industry. 
(00:17:15):
People talk about it a lot, but it's never been driven home to me so much, because we're talking about something that had incredibly high stakes as people's health, and we're still able to do it in that context. So if we could do it there, you can imagine that the applications of that in other industries are just tremendous. So yeah, if you're listening to this, and you were thinking maybe you needed to add more stuff, I bet you could prune.
Lenny (00:17:39):
And it's nice to have the forcing function where the world is changing so quickly and the team's probably small, where you are forced to build small. Which I think is why this reminder is so important. Oftentimes you have more resources, and you end up building more just because you can. And yeah, what you're saying is oftentimes, "It'll shoot you in the foot."
Zoelle Egner (00:17:55):
Yes.
Lenny (00:17:56):
Amazing. I didn't expect to get into this much detail with VaccinateCA and so I'm glad we did. Let's zoom out a little bit, and just fill in some gaps on your background, briefly. Can you just highlight some of the other wonderful things you've done in career? Airtable, we talked about, VaccinateCA, just broadly, what else have you been up to? 
Zoelle Egner (00:18:13):
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so I'll try and be brief. I worked in tech for more than a decade, mostly marketing and customer success, a little bit of ops. Before I got into tech, I was a little bit of a dilettante, so some non-profit, healthcare, dying big box retail, because I graduated right into the recession and I was certain no one would hire me. Turns out that was actually wrong. But on the plus side, now I know what dysfunction looks like at great scale, which is actually quite an education and very useful. But I always knew I wanted to get into tech, partially because I'm from the Bay area, and partially because I had been obsessively power mapping the industry, and looking at its flocking patterns, and who had what types of influence, because I'm a nerd. And I really wanted to see if I could get in, in the first place. Because- 
Lenny (00:18:59):
Wait, can you talk about this, which, what is it you did? What did you call, a flocking pattern?
Zoelle Egner (00:19:05):
Sure. You can imagine in any community, there are nodes of influence, people who know a lot of folks, they have money, whatever it might be. And they're able to direct how that community or that ecosystem evolves. In the tech industry, typically VCs will often play a role in this, but so will certain types of executives. And you can follow how they move between different companies, and who they worked with, and then see that influences who gets investment in the future. It influences the different partnerships that evolve. It influences the assumed wisdom in various different careers. And because I'm a big old nerd, I was literally drawing diagrams based on-
Lenny (00:19:48):
Whoa.
Zoelle Egner (00:19:48):
... reading people's blog posts of who was influential in what way? Because I was non-technical. I tried programming, and I hated it, frankly. And so I was like, "Okay, it's 2010, it's 2011. There's not clear ways to get into the industry as a non-technical person. I need to figure out how to do this with people. Because otherwise I'm not sure why someone would take a chance on me with what I have done historically. And that sounds a little insane, but it's very effective. And I ended up getting my start in tech basically by identifying a company where I thought I had a unique set of connections or understanding of the space that they were working in, where I thought I could maybe email the CEO and be helpful.
Lenny (00:20:29):
And did this connect to that diagram you drew? Did this help you point in that direction?
Zoelle Egner (00:20:34):
Yeah, absolutely. So I was closely tracking YCombinator and that whole ecosystem. So I knew I wanted to find a smaller company, where they maybe were having more difficulty hiring, because they were less well known or a little bit less, I don't know, sexy. But while they were still connected into that broader group, because it has with a pedigree that people would take you seriously if you had worked at a YC backed startup.
Lenny (00:20:55):
Right.
Zoelle Egner (00:20:55):
Anyway, I got really pointy hat strategic about this, but it was effective. 
Lenny (00:21:00):
Do you still-
Zoelle Egner (00:21:00):
And-
Lenny (00:21:00):
... have this diagram, by the way? It'd be so funny to look at it right now.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
No, I don't think I have it anymore. I might be able to dig it up, but alas, I think it may have been lost in one of my many moves since then. 
Lenny (00:21:03):
All right.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
It's been-
Lenny (00:21:03):
No problem.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
... more than a decade. 
Lenny (00:21:18):
Okay. I imagine that was true. Okay, so I think I cut you off. You were talking about some of the things you've done in your career.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:20):
Yeah, ended up using my studies of the space to get into a role as employee one at a developer focus YC backed startup. And the funny story on that is that I got that role by cold emailing the CEO while I was still in college. And then he actually followed up with me almost immediately, because I'd offered to introduce him to some professors, which was useful for the type of business. And then I ignored him for two years because I got busy with my thesis, and got other jobs, and whatever, came back to it and wrote this ridiculous apology email, being like, "I promise I respond to emails faster. I see that you're hiring. Would you give me a second chance? Please, can I come work for you? I have no experience that's useful, but I work really hard." And I figured he would either laugh me off of the internet or give me a job, and very fortunately for me, he gave me a job. So thanks, Ryan. Appreciate that. That was how I got into tech.
Lenny (00:22:11):
Thanks, Ryan. 
Zoelle Egner (00:22:12):
Yes, we appreciate it. So that startup got acquired by Box. And when I went over to Box, they had never had paying developers before. So we were bringing over seven figure contracts. So I started developer success programs there. And then in a totally wild shift, I ended up moving over to run their social media editorial and internal comms, which doesn't sound related to developer success, but I had always been a writer, and I wrote this blog post about what it was like to be an early stage non-technical employee. There was a little spicy, talking about some of the challenges, and I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it. And I got this email from PR being like, "We need to have a meeting." And I was like, "Oh, they're going to fire me. I went too far." I thought I was being circumspect, that I went too far. And in the meeting they were like, "Hey, we really think you should apply for this job. We would love to have you run social media." Which is not the outcome I expected.
Lenny (00:23:05):
That's a cool learning, there. Just like, "Do stuff." You know? "Don't be afraid."
Zoelle Egner (00:23:08):
Yeah, it was definitely not the expected outcome, but one that was very exciting. So got to go run those programs for a couple years through the IPO, which is a whole education in and of itself, to see how comms changes when you become a public company. And then I was on Hacker News obsessively at the time, and I saw the beta for Airtable come out. Immediately signed up, and became obsessed with the product, and evangelizing it to everybody that I knew and ultimately ended up figuring out a way to finagle my way into that role as employee 11 there. 
(00:23:43):
And it sounds like we're going to talk about Airtable more, so I won't belabor that, but marketing and customer success stuff, ended up leaving for VaccinateCA, and then the last little bit here is just when that ended, I really thought I wanted to start my own company. So I gave myself a certain window in which to try out different ideas, and at the same time was advising and consulting. Ultimately didn't end up finding anything that I felt so much conviction that it was worth blowing up absolutely everything else about my life in order to go heads down on a company. So eventually decided to go in-house with one of the companies I've been advising, Block Party, and now I run marketing and growth there.
Lenny (00:24:19):
Can you just explain Block Party briefly? [inaudible 00:24:21]-
Zoelle Egner (00:24:21):
Absolutely. We're an online safety company. We help users have more control over their digital experience. And our first product is anti-harassment and anti-spam tools for Twitter.
Lenny (00:24:30):
So you've worked at Box, Airtable, now Block Party. You've advised a lot of companies around marketing product growth. I'm curious if there's a thread that has maintained through all of those experiences in terms of what works well for marketing, and growth, and things you've learned that just consistently- [inaudible 00:24:52]
Zoelle Egner (00:24:52):
A few pieces that go into how I choose companies that create that thread. And part of this is about me wanting to match what I think I'm really good at with what will have the greatest leverage for a company that I work at. I've mentioned I'm a writer, really care about telling stories, and helping people to understand new or novel things. I also really care about product quality. I'm a little bit of a product snob. And one of my strengths is enthusiasm. So if I can't genuinely go to a customer and tell them, "This product is going to solve a real problem for you and it's going to be amazing." I can't do my job. So all of the companies that I've chosen to go to have had this foundation of an incredible product experience that maybe people didn't fully understand, and where I could come in and help connect the dots between that amazing product that's going to be really, really helpful and the opportunities for a much wider range of people to benefit from that.
(00:25:46):
So in practice, what that means is I often end up working at companies that are in a position to really punch above their weight from a brand perspective. They're typically much lower headcount than you would ever expect. They're typically way earlier stage than you would expect, but I've been able to put together a brand or an experience that allows people to invest themselves into the company with a high level of trust, I guess. 
(00:26:13):
I'll be more specific because that's really ambiguous. Airtable, it manages mission critical workflows, highly sensitive data. It's super important. You only use tools you can trust for that type of thing. The same thing is true at Block Party, online safety. You have to trust the company that you're entrusting your safety to. And in my experience, people, and especially founders really underestimate how much every single touchpoint a customer has from word of mouth or the ad that brings them in the door, landing pages, signup flows, customer service experiences. Every single one of those moments is building a brand that is adding or removing trust.
(00:26:48):
So for me in the early days, that means thinking about like, "What are the signals that I can provide to future customers that say, 'We understand you specifically, and our solution is designed for a person like you.' And two, that will say, 'Hey, we're actually operating on a much higher level than you might expect for a company of our size or our stage. We take this really seriously. We have all the things in place to take care of you. So you shouldn't be afraid to spend six figures or put your safety in our hands because we've got your back. We're doing this the right way.'" Has tremendous dividends when you're in a business that is often driven by word of mouth. Because if you take care of people and you follow up that brand experience with a product experience that is really powerful and actually does the things that says it's going to do, then your word of mouth can become a huge driver of growth for the company.
(00:27:40):
Of course, the outcome of this in practice is really funny. So I remember really distinctly having to invite customers to go out to lunch with us when they would come to San Francisco back in the Airtable days, because we had 15 people in a teeny tiny office. It's not that I wanted to mislead anyone, but I didn't need to reinforce the fact that they were spending six figures with us when we had 15 people. If they had gone to look on LinkedIn, they could have figured that out, but we didn't need to remind them that we were so small, and they were running some of their most important processes with our product. I think I was on the phone with Slack at one point. And they were like, "Oh, well you guys are probably about the same size company as we are, right?" And I was like, "Not quite. A little smaller, just an entire order of magnitude, no big deal, it's totally fine. We're all smooth. We'll take care of you. It's going to great." But it-
Lenny (00:27:40):
Amazing.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:27):
... really makes a difference, all of those little things.
Lenny (00:28:31):
That reminds me, I heard stories of very early Airbnb days where they had to take meetings in a bathroom, or in the hallway, and they did interviews, I think in the hallway because there was no space.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:41):
We did a lot of calling from the hallway at Airtable, also from this weird internal patio you could only get to through climbing through a window. The window kept breaking. And so I, at one point, remember someone getting stuck outside trying to interview someone with the windows closed. Utter, utter ridiculous nonsense. But you know, that's all the fun things that happened in the early days before you become bigger.
Lenny (00:29:06):
Yeah, I love those early day stories. 
Zoelle Egner (00:29:08):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:29:09):
I really love the concept of punching above your weight as a startup. What else did you do at Air Table or other places that help you do that? One is just don't let them see how small you are, necessarily. Are there any other technical things you recall that like, "Oh, here's things that really worked really well for punching above our weight as a small company at that point."
Zoelle Egner (00:29:29):
A couple of these things are very unsexy, but very useful. One, make sure that your landing pages, and your emails, and other things have a level of polish that makes them feel a little bit more done. I think there is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:30:20):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
(00:30:45):
So those little bits of polish that don't take a ton of time are absolutely worth it. The last thing I would say is making sure that in your public communications launches, if you ever talk to press, which some companies can and some companies can't, having more of a point of view than just about your product, you can try and say, like, "We are part of something bigger. Here's the broader circle or movement that we are a part of." It makes it feel more inevitable and more like you're not just self servingly talking about your tiny corner of the world, but that it's actually part of this much bigger trend. It will be more compelling and it feels like you're operating at a different level of sophistication that can be really helpful.
Lenny (00:31:28):
I love that. On the first point, basically, it's attention to detail and obsession with quality is what I'm hearing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:34):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:31:34):
Just to make it clear, this isn't just a tiny team just pushing the stuff out. I imagine most founders would be like, "Yes, I would love, we are going to focus on quality. We'll make sure everything looks great." In reality it always is this trade off against other things they could be doing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:50):
Yep. 
Lenny (00:31:50):
What do you think folks can do to help keep that level of quality high? Is it just one person being obsessed and just reviewing everything like a founder? Is having someone like you that's just very detail oriented, just review everything? How do you actually execute that when you have 1,000 things to do?
Zoelle Egner (00:32:05):
100%. I'd say there's one of two approaches and you articulated them here. One is you can have the founder that is the avatar of quality, who is just relentlessly being like, "Hey, we're going to do the 15 minute check. Yes, we're going through it. Yes, I'm going to send you a copy of this email, and someone else going to click every link in it, and make sure they're not broken." Or, you can have someone else be the avatar of that who is in the company. I would say in many of the companies I have worked at, that has been me, because I've been the marketing human who cares. But it doesn't have to be a marketing person, it can be someone on product. It can be, honestly, even someone on customer success if you're willing to let them provide their feedback on the way that you're showing up in the world, which you should because they have fantastic insight. There just needs to be someone. 
(00:32:50):
And I think building that into how you interview can be very helpful, as well. So finding people who understand those trade-offs and that balance, and who are willing to put in the extra 15 minutes, but aren't going to spend an extra week trying to obsessively QA everything. You don't want to go that far. Just who has that bent towards detail can be very helpful. Also, just make yourself a checklist. It doesn't have to be complicated. "Every time we put out a blog post, these are the three things we're going to do. Every time we send out an email, it needs to be seen by at least one other person." None of this is rocket science. You just need to make a little process for yourself, and then it can be very fast and lightweight, but the dividends are worth it, I think.
Lenny (00:33:31):
I like how simple this is, just to look like a bigger company, is just pay attention and focus on the little things. It's not a big, whole thing. [inaudible 00:33:39]
Zoelle Egner (00:33:39):
There are some bigger things you can do if you really need to. My favorite silly example of this is Airtable, back in the day, got roasted on Twitter for having billboards that were not super specific about a specific problem or whatever. They were just billboards that we had out. And everyone was like, "This makes no sense. Why are you doing this? We don't understand." They were actually super effective for us because we had a different goal than everyone thought that we did. 
(00:34:03):
For us, it was all about signaling to some very large companies that we were a legitimate and large enough company that they could trust, and we had geographical concentration in specific areas, because we were in the fashion industry, the media industry in New York, we knew exactly where all of their offices were and we knew if they saw our billboards, walking to work, and then got the request to IT for the budget in order to pay six figures for Airtable, they were more likely to be like, "Oh, it's not just some weird startup we never heard of." Like, "Oh, I've seen that billboard, they must be legitimate." And that sounds really silly, but it wasn't actually that expensive.
(00:34:40):
We got mostly remnant inventory, which is at the end of a particular buying cycle. Sometimes they haven't fully sold everything, and you can get the slightly less good ones that are still maybe where you want them for really cheap. And everyone thinks that you only buy billboards if you're huge. So that small signaling thing was a way for us to make sure that we remove some of the risk of not being able to close deals because we were so small. So you can get creative about it. Most of the time you're not going to do that. Most of the time it's like, "Reread your emails." But you could also push it even further if you need to.
Lenny (00:35:12):
What is that full rough cost of billboards like? Because I think people think about billboards and it's hard to even know what they cost. What's a number?
Zoelle Egner (00:35:20):
It really, really depends, so I'm hesitant to give you a number because which metro you're in, it ranges vastly. I would say you can expect that some of that inventory is in the low thousands of dollars, which is way lower than you might expect.
Lenny (00:35:34):
For one billboard.
Zoelle Egner (00:35:36):
Yeah. So you don't need to get a million. And I'm not suggesting you go get one on 101. Good luck to you on that. That's expensive. But you can get one in a reasonable neighborhood in New York for way less money than you might expect, if you're willing to do remnant.

(00:36:41):
Following this thread a bit, my next question is, and this may be the answer, is when you think about Airtable's growth strategy, growth tactics over time, what would you say are one, or two, or three of the most impactful marketing or growth tactics that work best over time? And maybe billboards are one of them.
Zoelle Egner (00:37:02):
I wouldn't say they were the highest ROI, but they're certainly one of the more interesting things that we did. They were useful, don't get me wrong. But I think maybe some other ones are more interesting. The boring answer that I will caveat this with is that one of the pieces of our acquisition playbook, it was very standard, that did work quite well, was some unconventionally targeted Facebook ads. That era is over. So don't expect that that is going to work for your B2B business now because that that's totally changed.
Lenny (00:37:29):
And when you say unconventional, what do you mean?
Zoelle Egner (00:37:31):
We spent a lot of time thinking about a psychographic profile for our users. So the challenge of Airtable is that you can use it for anything. It can be used in every department within an organization. It can be used for personal stuff, you name it, it has a use, because you're functionally building your own software and you can build software for anything. Unfortunately, if you go out to the market with a message of, like, "Build your own software." The vast majority of people are like, "I want to do that. That sounds hard. That sounds stupid. No." 
(00:38:01):
And so we couldn't really use super generic messaging, but to go really specific into verticals, which we did end up ultimately doing, didn't give us the broad coverage to go find new opportunities. You go really deep into one particular vertical or two particular verticals at a time with a small team, but then we weren't surfacing new opportunities that might be even more important. So we tried to balance that vertical specific work that we did with also trying to find this type of person who we had discovered was going to be the best champion for us. 
(00:38:33):
And this is a tinkerer persona, someone who likes new technology, they like putting together the Lego building blocks of things, and you couldn't really find Tinkerer's Magazine. There's not like a place those people hang out. They don't just have one title. It's a psychographic profile as a type of person that could have many, many different roles. And so instead-
Lenny (00:38:56):
And Facebook doesn't let you do that anymore, right?
Zoelle Egner (00:38:59):
No. You can't target based on-
Lenny (00:39:01):
[inaudible 00:39:01] go.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:02):
... like, "They have a tinkerer mentality," unfortunately. 
Lenny (00:39:04):
Okay, got it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
It's so sad. 
Lenny (00:39:05):
Okay. I see-
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
But-
Lenny (00:39:05):
... that it's not possible. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:07):
Yeah. But what you can do is you can say, "That type of person often likes these types of media. We've heard that they often are really into these podcasts, so they're really into reading about this type of personal development." And often that is associated with people who have these broad set of roles but have this typical mentality. So we would find clusters of interests that people might have, that often were shared by those people, and do targeting around that. And then when that worked, they'll look alike based on it.
Lenny (00:39:38):
Did not expect Facebook ads as one of these answers. So that's interesting. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:42):
No, and it's not a good idea anymore. Don't do it now. 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Disclaimer.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:44):
Back in the day, it was great. Now I would not recommend. But I have some unconventional ones that I can suggest that are- 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Get into it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:52):
... not Facebook. There's a few different things, but I want to give some context first for people who are not as familiar with Airtable's business, because I do think these are really helpful pieces of context. The first is because of the types of industries that we are often very successful in, had a very similar network effect that we would see, where basically it was within specific professions, we would see people who, in order to distinguish themselves in that job market, would build a brand around the tools that they used, essentially. We found different ways to accelerate their process of identifying those roles, where it was really, really helpful to build a brand for yourself so that you could hop around to different jobs more quickly, accelerate your process, et cetera, and thus bring along a tool with you and evangelize for it a lot. So that's one set of things we were trying to achieve.
(00:40:46):
The second set of things we were trying to achieve that's also useful context here, is although industry virality was really important for us, even more important was inside of company virality, that was the real superpower of Airtable. We'd go from 10 people to 1,000 people a year. And so we were always looking for ways to make that happen within companies in more and more efficient ways.
(00:41:08):
And then the third piece here is no one had a good generic explanation of Airtable that worked for everybody. This is perhaps partially my fault as marketing, but it's also the fault of the fact that the market was not ready for the good, generic explanation to mean anything, like I mentioned before, people just did not care about the generic explanation. And the magic of Airtable was always seen in its specificity. 
(00:41:32):
So we knew if we can get to the right people and we can connect the dots to them to the correct use case, so they want to go and evangelize to improve their careers, they will do that both externally and within their companies, and more importantly within the companies, they'll be able to go to their friends and say, "Hey, I'm using Airtable as a content calendar, but you have a UX research problem. And I understand Airtable enough that I can help you build a system. And now I'm a superhero internally because I helped you build this whole new thing. Look at me, I'm amazing." And they suddenly have fully done a sales pitch for Airtable without us having to do any work or understand their use case, which is great and very necessary when you are as horizontal as we are. So we had to figure out essentially, "How do we catalyze that word of mouth and build champions at scale?"
(00:42:21):
All of that is to say the two interesting things that we did were all around that. In the very early days, what that meant in practice was we literally had a Slack integration that we pulled in a whole bunch of information about anyone who signed up for Airtable, including their title, the company that they worked at, et cetera. And literally would sit there and had a little button in each of the records that came in that would allow us to email them immediately if we had decided that they might be someone we want to talk to. And we set up this whole automated system so that it would take two seconds to reach out to a ton of different people, being like, "Hey, we'd really love to get your feedback and help make sure you're as successful as possible on Airtable." 
(00:43:02):
This is not scalable in the long term because there's a whole bunch of sending emails and doing meetings. But what it meant is that we were able to start building our mental model for what these champions looked like in practice by finding the patterns across them. And building the foundation is what ultimately became our customer success motion very early. And then we were able to say, "Okay, we found five people who have a content calendar use case with this type of title. And now we'll be able to go run an ad campaign based on that. We can build a bunch of templates based on that. Here's all these different hooks we can use, because we know this is what a champion can look like," in a way that was not going to be obvious if we hadn't talked to a ton of people. So it seems really unobvious as an investment, per se, but tremendous number of human hours going into just having an efficient way to talk to as many people as possible to build those mental models. That's number one.
Lenny (00:43:57):
That is fascinating. Essentially, you weren't even sure who would be excited about Airtable. Part of this is like, "Figure out the personas and groups of people that we believe are the right target to encourage and help support." And then part of that is, "Get it spreading within a company once you figure out these folks within a company." It's such a cool idea to just have a feed of ... I imagine the squad had certain attributes of the person, like, "Here's the company they work. Here's how big it is." And then they talk about, there's a mention of what they're using it for. Is that part of this?
Zoelle Egner (00:44:31):
Ideally. Though we were always very privacy minded, so we couldn't actually get much information about what they were doing in Airtable. We could never see their data, because that would be a tremendous failure of trust, to go back to what we were talking about before. So a lot of this, we would have guesses, and maybe we could see that they'd use certain templates but we didn't otherwise really know. And that was part of the reason why we wanted to talk to them in the first place. 
(00:44:54):
The second reason is that if we could talk to them early, we could help them build their first space, and from there, if they were successful, they would have the tools to go and help other people within their organization. So if we catch them at the beginning, make sure one person was successful by over investing in them, then they essentially became support for everybody else. I should also clarify, these were not necessarily people who were going to be the buyers. The buyers and the champions here look very, very different for Airtable, which is a really an interesting dynamic that many companies do not have. But for us, the person who is going to sit down with a glass of wine on a Friday and build an Airtable base was not the person who had the budget who was going to pay for this thing. 
(00:45:36):
And so we weren't initially looking for buyers, we were looking for champions, in part so that we could then go to IT six months down the line and be like, "Look, you have 500 people using this product, it's been very useful for them. It is time for you to pay now." Not sure IT loved those conversations, but they were really effective for us and meant that it was very, very easy to sell.
Lenny (00:45:57):
Fascinating. It makes me think a lot about the product led sales movement and how this is essentially that, but even earlier, because it's people just signed up and they're just helping them be successful, versus like, "This company's got 14 people using it. You should go try to sell them on an enterprise contract." Essentially this was a tool to help you figure out how to, basically scaling customer success and helping you prioritize who to go after, and being very hands-on with the strongest potential future big buyers.
Zoelle Egner (00:46:24):
Exactly. And I think what's interesting here is it helped us bootstrap two things. One was, to your point, building out the personas, and champions, and so on. And ultimately there's more scalable ways to reach those people in the long run. But secondarily, it also helped us deal with a real product education problem that we had in the early days. Because it was really complicated. Airtable, unfortunately, has two education issues that it needs to solve. It's not just, "How do I put the Lego blocks together?" It is also, "How do I design a piece of software and a workflow?"
(00:47:01):
And unfortunately if you're selling to content marketing manager or a UX researcher, there's no guarantee that they know how to make a workflow. Most software is opinionated, and it does that work for you, and you're like, "It either works for you or it doesn't." And maybe you're frustrated about what it forces you to do in order to work, but you can't really control it, which means when suddenly, you have the ability to create whatever workflow that you want, there's actually some education that needs to go into it in order to be able to make that successful. 
(00:47:28):
It's not enough to just make an Airtable base that's pretty or that functions. You can't get your team to use it effectively if it doesn't fit into the broader context of the organization. It's still going to fail. And so a lot of this was us figuring out, like, "Okay, how do we help these people not only use our product but build something that is going to be durable, so that we do see that growth, so they don't see it as a failure, so it doesn't fail at that second order moment when it starts to get spread out to more people?"
Lenny (00:47:53):
It's a really good tactic for any SaaS product that just is hard to understand and needs, Airtable had both problems. Like, "I don't know what this is for and I don't know exactly how it's going to fit into my workflow." Imagine most-
Zoelle Egner (00:48:05):
But-
Lenny (00:48:05):
... companies still have to deal with both those problems. 
Zoelle Egner (00:48:07):
No, hopefully not. Hopefully not. 
Lenny (00:48:07):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:08):
But once you actually get in with folks, it's very difficult to remove it. So suddenly your retention rates are incredible, your word of mouth is incredible, if you're willing to do that initial work. A lot of people think that Airtable was a pure product led growth company, and missed that huge customer success component that was always very, very important in the early days. And that helped us ultimately move more towards that PLG motion for a while, but was essential to getting it set up in the first place.
Lenny (00:48:35):
Fascinating.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:36):
The other one that we did related to this champions at scale was we spent a hilarious amount of money on really fancy swag. I know this sounds silly, but branded AirPods level of fancy swag. Admittedly more people were in the office back then. Now they are more remote and this would not work as well. But back in the day, if you gave people something really good, not a pen or a sticker, really good, they would show it off to absolutely everyone that they talked to, because they were so excited they got branded AirPods. People would ask about it, walking by their desks. It sounds so like trivial. But for that couple hundred bucks that we spent knowing like, "Hey, this person's already a champion and if someone asks them, they're going to give a really good pitch." Totally worth it. Sometimes better to not skimp on swag. Hard to measure, very effective.
Lenny (00:49:27):
That's a great tip. And it connects to the general idea of find your champions and just do a lot to make sure they're successful, excited, want to evangelize, and an AirPod here and there feel like a really good ROI investment.
Zoelle Egner (00:49:40):
Was for us.
Lenny (00:49:41):
Anything else along those lines?
Zoelle Egner (00:49:42):
I think those are the big ones that I would highlight. The only other small note I would make from a process perspective is if you are going to overinvest in customer success, which I recommend, make sure that you have also set up a process to take the insights that your customer success people are coming up with and turn them into as much content as you can. Because that's where you're going to find scale in the long run. So for us, what that meant was we would talk to a bunch of customers and then customer success would have helped them build bases, and then we would create templates. So were not exact copies, because we're not trying to steal their intellectual property. We would say, "What is the fundamental workflow here, that other companies might have? How do we make a template that is useful from this?" And some blog posts that explain it, whatever else, that we can then put out into the market. 
(00:50:25):
And the next time a smaller company that's not a Fortune 500 wants this sort of thing, someone can just email them that template and we don't have to go through this whole build process, they have something to start with. If you can find those insights and put them genuinely into use as a little conveyor belt, it will be much easier to scale. It will be much easier to come up with genuinely compelling content because it's coming from your customers, so they already care about it. You have strong signal that's going to be valuable if you already built it for them. Use that to your advantage, make that into a little machine. And it makes all of the go-to market that you need to do later easier.
Lenny (00:50:57):
I know that you have the strong opinion that customer success and marketing are basically the same thing and should be maybe one team. Can you speak to that?
Zoelle Egner (00:51:05):
Yeah. This is my spicy opinion, but both of them have to do the same things. They have to identify customer needs. They have to help the customers see your product as a solution to those needs. They need to remove friction from the process of getting value. They are hopefully both encouraging those customers to share with other people, and both of them should be engaged in translating insights from those individuals into resources that can help everybody. 
(00:51:31):
They use different tactics. Marketing is going to use more scalable tactics. Customer success is going to be in the weeds, really talking to individual people, but all of the things they care about are actually the same thing. They just use different ways to do it. And if you, as a marketer, are not pretty confident in being able to say, like, "What I'm doing is getting the right people to get genuine value from this product," so much so that they want to tell other people about it because it's going to make them look good, then maybe figure out if there's ways to bring more of that to your process, because it will make what you are doing more effective.
(00:52:05):
And frankly, there's not a better evangelist than a person whose career you have materially helped to improve based on matching the right person to the solution so that they can have more impact at their company. So much said, one of my unofficial metrics for both marketing and customer success at Airtable, unofficial, was how many people we'd gotten promoted for using the product. I had a running tally of those people, and I knew if we were getting those at the major accounts we were trying to win, something good was happening and we were going to be successful with really large deals.
Lenny (00:52:36):
So curious how you tracked that. I guess you just check in with them occasionally?
Zoelle Egner (00:52:40):
No, I had my CSMs literally, they had really strong relationships. We were actually tracking it. It was a little embarrassing, but it worked really well.
Lenny (00:52:47):
I love it, with the great KPI. It's like dating apps and how many people get married, I guess.
Zoelle Egner (00:52:52):
Exactly. 
Lenny (00:52:53):
Zooming out a little bit, you advise a lot of companies on marketing, customer success, growth, and things like that. Maybe there's a two part question, and see where you want to take it. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:03):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:53:03):
One is just what are activities that marketing, and growth, and customer success teams often do that are impactful and consistently impactful, things that you think startups should invest in that maybe they aren't, or they already aren't and they should definitely keep doing this. And on the flip side, things that don't work, things that maybe they should avoid. So maybe let's start there and there's going to be a followup. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:26):
Cool. Okay. I'm going to start with things to avoid, because I try and not to make too many blanket statements on this, but I have a couple that I am willing to make. So this is all with the caveat that channel market fit is really real, and sometimes these things might work for you. Don't discount just because I say that they don't work for me. There are certain types of flashy event marketing and sponsorships that you will get relentlessly invited to do, that will seem like they're going to be really great for signaling purposes, or for leads, or whatever. 
(00:53:55):
And they're almost always a waste of your time, unless you are in an industry where you desperately need to get to a trade show, because that's where everyone hangs out. At that point, yeah, of course you're going to have to go do that. But if you're in more standard B2B SaaS, or that's not really a thing, there are better ways to get in front of those people than having your logo out there. That doesn't tell them anything. Maybe you get a branded session at the conference or whatever, but who's going to go to that branded session? Probably not that many people. And then you will have spent so much money and gotten nothing for it. Go to the event, do not fund your money on the sponsorship. It's stupid. And then the second one, which is definitely a very spicy opinion, but I'm going to go there. 
Lenny (00:54:40):
Go there. 
Zoelle Egner (00:54:41):
A lot of people think that the epitome of product marketing is creating your own category. And while I agree that it is useful to have strong differentiators, because it is, I think creating a category, getting a new thing in Gartner or whatever, is often a waste of your time. It is a huge lift, absolutely enormous, particularly in B2B SaaS, and I'm not always sure that it's helpful to have your super teeny tiny, little niche over here where you're like, "Oh, we have no competitors." That's not actually how buyers work. It's not really worth it. 
(00:55:21):
That said, there are things you can do that feel like category creation that are actually effective, and that I do think make more sense. And specifically if you can elevate a profession instead of a category, that can make way more sense. So the great example of this is that Gainsight creating customer success or many companies altogether carving out DevOps, or rebranding DevOps, to be a thing that was suddenly a sexy job to have. 
(00:55:47):
And I think that's valuable because a job is an identity and people will fight for an identity. A category of software is a line item on your budget. No one is excited about that. But people are very excited about their job being meaningful, and their job being important, and being taken seriously. And so if you could hold up either an existing or a brand new job and say, "This is really important for much broader business metrics, whatever else. We're going to create community for those people to come together and it's all about the job," and not about you. That can be very powerful and they'll take them with you. You become part of the identity of that career. Amazing. Do that, for sure. But like the Gartner Square, there's some opportunities for that where it makes sense. A lot of the times it doesn't. Don't do that.
Lenny (00:56:34):
Amazing. I love that. Is there more you wanted to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (00:56:34):
No. 
Lenny (00:56:34):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:56:39):
I think that's enough on not to do.
Lenny (00:56:40):
What this reminds me of broadly is just, "Stay focused on the customer and their problems. Don't obsess with who you are, who are you selling to and how will you make their life better." Reminds me of this old idea from Kathy Sierra. Does that ring a bell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:56:55):
Where-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Oh totally. 
Lenny (00:56:56):
... you make your customer a superhero, you want them to feel like a superhero. And if they-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:56):
It works-
Lenny (00:56:59):
... feel like a superhero. And yeah, that sounds like that's essentially what you did with Airtable, a lot of these companies you worked with.
Zoelle Egner (00:57:05):
That that is always the goal. Like, "How can you make them the hero of the story and not you? Because no one cares about your company, what they care about is themselves, frankly."
Lenny (00:57:12):
Are there any products or companies you think of off the top of your head that are really good at this, that are just like they nailed this?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:18):
Yeah, that's a good question. Certainly the two that I mentioned, that helped rebrand some of the professions, so like the Gainsights of the world. I'm blanking a little bit on the ones that have done this for DevOps really effectively, but there's certainly some that have.
Lenny (00:57:32):
Maybe Datadog?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:33):
Yeah, Datadog has done a pretty good job of that. I think where I get excited is when the companies do this in a way that feels less self-serving, or less obviously self-serving. And that means that sometimes you have to be willing to invest in things that will not have super obviously immediate ROI for you, but they will for the community, and for building the community. Oh, actually one really good example, I think Notion has actually done a pretty good job of this. People are really, really invested in the templates that they create, because it feels like you're not pushing Notion, you're pushing the beautiful creation that you have to solve a problem. I think they've done a really nice job on that process, and several of their competitors, I think have done a pretty decent job as well, but they certainly come to mind.
Lenny (00:58:18):
Thinking of templates, I know Airtable, known for templates, and you've mentioned this being a big part of the success, and I imagine a lot of companies now are just creating templates left, because they imagine that's the core, what helped a lot of these companies, Notion being an example. What is your take on the power and importance of templates for software?
Zoelle Egner (00:58:38):
I think they can be tremendously helpful if you are horizontal because they help to narrow the surface area for a user, so they understand how to connect the dots between their problem and your product. And if it is not obvious to someone how they can solve a specific problem, they're going to be like, "Oh, hey, that seems really cool. When I think of something I'll definitely come back." And then you have lost them. And so if you can be like, "Here are three templates that a person you might be excited about." That can be really helpful. Where people sometimes get confused about templates, or have the wrong expectations about templates, is when they think that templates are going to be an acquisition mechanism, and they don't build in the foundation that is necessary for that to be true. So a lot of people think that templates were what drove Airtable's top of funnel. That is not the case. 
(00:59:27):
I was having a conversation with someone who worked a lot on SEO at Airtable in the much later days, and laughing over the fact that people thought that was a big source of traffic, because it was not. We did not optimize them for that. Good luck finding them in search most of the time. Not at all useful. Where they were helpful, narrowing that surface area, helping with matching patterns, helping people understand how the product worked, super helpful. Expansion within companies, tremendously useful. 
(00:59:55):
But they were not a top of funnel mechanism for us, because we didn't put the work in to do that. We did not have an SEO engine. We weren't Zapier. Zapier has done a great job with that. They get a ton of traffic because they built it as a programmatic SEO play, but you have to be clear about what your goals are and what problem they're solving, because otherwise it is very easy to be like, "I'll just build a bunch of templates, and then all of the leads will appear," And that's not going to happen unless you invest in a lot more than at least Airtable did. So it can be useful to build them, know what you're doing it for, and how you're going to measure it, or otherwise you'll waste your time.
Lenny (01:00:29):
Do you think Airtable could have taken advantage of that top of funnel approach if they invested from an SEO perspective or do you think it wasn't an opportunity that worked?
Zoelle Egner (01:00:37):
I think it could have been. We would've needed to hire more humans. Airtable was an incredibly lean team for a very, very long time. From 2015, when I joined, until 2017 or 2018, we had barely 50 people. It was small for many, many years and so we had to make really difficult choices about what to prioritize and what not to prioritize. Should we have hired more people and done more things? I would argue in retrospect, absolutely, yes, there were opportunities that were left on the table, but in early days you leave good opportunities because you have to focus on other things.
Lenny (01:01:13):
Got it. And so a takeaway here is templates could be really useful for customer success versus SEO top of funnel. Right? That's-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:13):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:01:20):
... where they became powerful. 
Zoelle Egner (01:01:21):
Still maybe helpful. Maybe for you, it makes sense to do the SEO play, just know that that is not a small play. It is an investment. It is not and not just like, "Have some people make some templates." You got to do way more than just that. It's not going to be sufficient.
Lenny (01:01:35):
Final potential question, depending on where this goes, and I'm curious how spicy this answer gets, and-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:35):
Oh boy.
Lenny (01:01:40):
It's around launches and PR. You work with a lot of startups, I imagine founders are always trying to plan a launch, get PR. I'm curious your take on the value of investing a bunch of resources in a big launch, the value of just getting PR as an early stage startup.
Zoelle Egner (01:01:56):
Yeah, just getting PR is not a good goal. I know that's been well stated in the market, but just to reiterate it, most of the time PR is not going to get you leads or users, it's just not. And you have to think about when you are creating a launch or doing a piece of PR, what are the breadcrumbs that bring someone back to something that can actually convert? If you have your big tech crunch piece and it's super exciting, it says all these great things about you, and it maybe links to you once, somewhere in the 12th paragraph or whatever, how many people are actually going to click on that link? Not that many people. How many people are going to read that and remember to go Google it? Not as many as you want. Okay? There's going to be so much coming out of the funnel, it is not a useful acquisition mechanism.
(01:02:43):
What it is good for is credibility. And that's where, if you have really clear goals, and you know how you are ready to leverage the asset of a piece of PR coverage, then it can be helpful to you. So the two goals I always recommend to founders when thinking about using PR, are either hiring or maybe improving the response rate for your cold outbound. Those are the two that I think make the most sense, because in both cases they have a different distribution mechanism. In hiring, you're going to include that in an email that you're sending to a candidate. And so it's going to increase the likelihood that they take you seriously, and get excited about the company, and maybe actually end up ultimately joining your team. 
(01:03:22):
Cold outbound, you're using it as credibility to say, "Hey, we're a real company you can trust." Great. Both of those things are all emails that you are proactively sending. You know exactly who they're going to, and you know that asset is going to have, hopefully, the impact that you're looking for, and you can measure whether it makes a difference or not. But just getting a piece of PR, to get a piece of PR is like it'll help with your internal morale, but I'm not sure it's going to do much help for you. So have really clear goals and have realistic goals, or you will be disappointed.
(01:03:51):
Launches however, do not need to just be about PR. In fact, in many cases PR is a distraction, and instead you can have not just one big launch but a series of launches that allow you to stay top of mind, to create momentum with your users, and to show up in lots of different places because audiences respond to novelty, it gives them a reason to care about your company. And so have your big, annual launch or whatever, but also have one two months from then, and another one, and another one. Find ways to use that novelty to your advantage and to get into communities that you think are going to be good fits for your company.
Lenny (01:04:26):
I love that advice. Any final thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Zoelle Egner (01:04:34):
Mostly just all of this is easier if you talk to your customers more. Build a system for yourself that will allow you to have those touchpoints. That's not just making everyone answer customer support tickets, though I do think that is a great idea, because it gives so much empathy and it's really helpful. You as a founder, if you're a founder, or a product manager, or whatever else, should find a way to get that on your calendar weekly or monthly. Go talk to people, it makes it better. You will have a better mental model. The other thing is strongly consider investing in customer success if you are a B2B company, early. Airtable had it before sales, which is a very unconventional approach, but early is worth it. It has huge dividends if you actually listen to them. If you're not going to listen to them, though, don't hire them, because that's sad.
Lenny (01:05:22):
I have followup questions on the customer success piece, say someone wants to invest in customer success, is there a resource, or person, or anything that you could point folks to, to understand and think about how to do this well?
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
There's a lot for people within that profession. There's not as much for founders out there right now, unfortunately. This is an area that I very eagerly am looking for more resources to share with people. Minimally. I'll say, if you care about this, send me a message. I will give you some advice. All of our industry will be better if there are more people working on customer success. So I will help you. Send me a note. Otherwise, I'll try and dig out some other things and maybe you can share them, but there's not a ton. So people in customer success, please share your learnings more with founders. All of us-
Lenny (01:05:36):
Have-
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
... would like to see it.
Lenny (01:06:09):
Yeah, I've actually been looking for someone to write a guest post in the newsletter, about just how to set up a customer success team. And so if you're listening, you think you could be that person. Let me-
Zoelle Egner (01:06:21):
Yeah, I have some people that I will not put on the spot right now, that I will send your way that I think- [inaudible 01:06:26]
Lenny (01:06:26):
Amazing. [inaudible 01:06:27]. Let's make this happen.
Zoelle Egner (01:06:28):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:29):
And then I wanted to ask you a question on the first piece of advice, which is, "Founders talk to the customers more often." Is there one tactical piece of advice you could recommend for how to do that?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:37):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:37):
How to find a customer, how to set it up consistently?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:40):
Totally. The simplest way to do this is to write a template email for yourself that you can send out very easily, that essentially says like, "Hey, thank you so much for using the product. I would really love to hear about your experience so far and get your feedback. Do you have 10 minutes to talk on the phone?" I know it is important that it's on the phone and not a survey because you get way more instinct from unstructured conversation than you're going to get from sending them three things in a Google survey.
(01:07:05):
Set it up, come up with a hypothesis of the type of person that you want to talk to and then run a query against your database, find someone and send three of those emails a week. And it's not exciting, but you can automate most of it and it will be helpful. None of this stuff has to be complicated. You just got to have a system.
Lenny (01:07:23):
Great advice. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:27):
Yes.
Lenny (01:07:27):
I've got six questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, let's see where it goes. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:34):
Okay.
Lenny (01:07:34):
Question number one. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Zoelle Egner (01:07:40):
Okay, I hate this question because I take pride in making highly targeted recommendations, but I will do it anyway. I'm pretty sure you mostly talk to product and growth people. Right now, obviously, AI is a big topic of conversation, so here are two books that will enrich your mental model for artificial intelligence and encourage you to think about it from different perspectives. The first one, a little bit academic, highly recommend it, though. It's a book called Computing Taste by Nick Seaver. 
(01:08:09):
He's a professor of anthropology and he did this study of people and companies who build music recognition algorithms. And it's a really interesting book for a bunch of reasons, including that it's a academic take on both tech culture, and more specifically, the unspoken and underlying assumptions that many workers who are building in this space have. It can be a little spicy and uncomfortable for a person in tech to read, but I think it is a fascinating perspective and very relevant to the stuff that's going on in AI right now. So go check it out. Computing Taste by Nick Seaver.
(01:08:42):
The second is a fiction book, but the Ancillary Justice series by Anne Leckie, about a spaceship AI that ends up separated from its ship and trapped in a body. I'm going to leave it at that. Worth reading for a different way of thinking about AI.
Lenny (01:08:56):
I think we need a Zoelle full episode on book recommendations. These are amazing. Let's keep going.
Zoelle Egner (01:08:56):
So fair.
Lenny (01:09:02):
What other podcast of yours that you love to listen to other than this podcast?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:07):
Probably either Happiness Lab or Gastropod. I love food and also psychology, one of those two.
Lenny (01:09:13):
Interesting. Okay, we'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:17):
Movie, Everything Everywhere All at Once. And TV show, there's a Korean drama called Extraordinary Attorney Woo. That, I really enjoyed.
Lenny (01:09:26):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:29):
Yeah. Okay, so this one is related to customer success. It's my favorite question of all. People hate it, sorry. But I like to ask anyone who's going to be in a customer facing role, who needs to be able to keep their cool, and also learn stuff on the fly, and respond to customers, to solve an unfamiliar problem using Zapier. And they can use the internet to look things up, whatever, but I basically lay out for them a problem that I, as the customer want to solve, and have them build it for me live. This both is surprising for most people, so you get to see how they respond to an unfamiliar situation, which every client will give you at some point, and it shows how they learn things in a very concrete way, which is really interesting. So check it out. It works really well for customer success.
Lenny (01:10:10):
I've not heard that one before. Fascinating. Top five SaaS products that you enjoy and an Airtable cannot be one?
Zoelle Egner (01:10:18):
Ugh. Okay, then I'll try and avoid any company that I have worked for. I really like using Figma. It's nice when designers let me play with things. I've been really enjoying working with Webflow, also means that I can do stuff on my own. This is maybe spicy, but I actually love Google Docs. I'm not a Notion's fan stand, sorry.
Lenny (01:10:18):
Hey.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
But Google Docs-
Lenny (01:10:37):
Can't [inaudible 01:10:37] them all.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
... is like my best friend.
Lenny (01:10:37):
Google Docs is great.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:38):
Yeah. And then there is a personal CRM company that I invested in, so sorry, maybe this is not allowed, but called Clay, and it is the only way I've ever been able to keep track of my-
Lenny (01:10:47):
Wow. [inaudible 01:10:47]-
Zoelle Egner (01:10:47):
... relationships in a real way.
Lenny (01:10:48):
Clay's great product.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:49):
They're the best. And then I don't know if I love it, but I use Zoom so much that I feel like I must say it, because I spend so much of my time on it and it's categorically better than Google Meet.
Lenny (01:11:01):
Final question, favorite book, course, article, any resource on marketing that non marketers can learn from?
Zoelle Egner (01:11:10):
Okay, it's a newsletter. Does that work?
Lenny (01:11:12):
Absolutely.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:13):
Amazing. Okay, so there is a specialist VC firm called MKT1. It's run by Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich, sorry if I pronounced your last name, there, wrong, Kathleen. It's all about marketing. They are marketing experts and operators who now invest, but they make the best frameworks that you can immediately apply. And there's templates and all sorts of super, super tactical stuff, which a lot of tactical marketing content is terrible because it's actually content marketing for some bad platform. Theirs is not. It is genuinely good. Go check it out. 
Lenny (01:11:43):
A huge fan. Emily has been on the podcast. 
Zoelle Egner (01:11:45):
Oh, [inaudible 01:11:47].
Lenny (01:11:47):
Yeah. And I look at that newsletter as the Lenny's newsletter of marketing, and it's exactly how you described.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:53):
It's the best.
Lenny (01:11:53):
Huge fan. Great recommendation. With that, Zoelle, thank you so much for being here. This was a lot of fun. And we got through a lot of stuff, which makes me really happy. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:09):
I am on Twitter @Zoelle. I'm also on LinkedIn, so I live there, come find me there. Otherwise, how can you be useful to me? Mostly like go forth and believe in customer success, and talk to your users, number one, because I am an avid user of technology, and I want it all to be better. Number two, no, that's all I got. Just go do those things and I will be so happy. Also, if you want to talk about customer success, anytime, hit me up. I'm here.
Lenny (01:12:35):
I'm going to add a couple more things, which you mentioned to me offline, that you're hiring at Block Party.
Zoelle Egner (01:12:39):
Yes.
Lenny (01:12:39):
You're hiring growth people, PMs, engineers, and then you're also advising on the side with marketing customer success. Anything else you want to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:48):
Yeah, absolutely. Love advising early stage companies. I'm especially helpful for pre seed and seed, usually, anything PLG, positioning, messaging, figuring out your channels, experimentation, all that early, fun stuff. I love it. Happy to help anytime. And we are hiring across all of the teams, but especially mine. So if you would like to come and do all sorts of fun experimentation, and also help keep people online safe, come look up, Block Party. I'd love to have you on my team. 
Lenny (01:13:18):
Blockparty.com, or where do folks- [inaudible 01:13:19]
Zoelle Egner (01:13:18):
Blockpartyapp.com. Did not-
Lenny (01:13:18):
App.com
Zoelle Egner (01:13:19):
... get blockparty.com. 
Lenny (01:13:19):
You didn't. Zoelle, thank you. Very good.
Zoelle Egner (01:13:23):
