## Transcript

Lenny (00:03):
Merci Grace has been a founder, an investor, head of growth at Slack, and now a founder again. She's also one of the co-founders of Women in Product, which, if you listen to this podcast, you know I'm a huge fan of. In our conversation we cover what she's learned from her time helping Slack build a product team and figure out growth, how Slack innovated the concept of product-led growth and scale it to become one of the biggest B2B companies in the world, the most common mistakes companies make when going product-led, signs you can and should go product-led, when to hire your first head of growth and what to look for, a bunch of advice on hiring, something Merci is incredibly good at, and so much more. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Merci Grace.

(03:02):
Merci, thank you so much for joining me. I've always been such a fan of yours from afar through your writing and your Twitter. We've interacted a bit on Twitter. We've never really had a deep conversation. And so I'm really excited. And so, welcome.

Merci Grace (03:18):
Thank you. Excited to be here.

Lenny (03:20):
I'm excited to chat. You have this incredible background. You're a founder, you're a game designer, you're head of product, head of growth at Slack. Then you became a VC. Now you're a founder again. Such an impressive and unusual journey. I'm curious how you got into product initially, and then just how did you work your way up to head of product and the head of growth at Slack?

Merci Grace (03:42):
Yeah, I got into product accidentally. I was first a game designer and actually started a venture-backed game studio right after college when I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I got my first term sheet as a founder before I knew what venture capital was. Purely accidental. And it's funny because my career arc went founder, game designer, product management, VC, CEO of your own startup, something that people try to do on purpose now, and I was not trying to do it on purpose at all. I was just following my curiosity and my love of how thinking works and how people make decisions. And so that really went from games, to product management, to venture, and then back into product.

Lenny (04:32):
Having been in VC now, having your own startup, what did you learn in that time that maybe surprised you now being a founder that, "Oh, wow. That was useful to learn and experience"?

Merci Grace (04:42):
Oh, yeah. So many things. I think one of the things that is quite obvious from the get-go, when you have had a few months under your belt, you've been seeing a bunch of pitches, and seeing the one-on-one pitches and then seeing the partner meeting pitches, is how different really great CEOs and startup leaders are at storytelling, at coming up with a pithy answer, at owning the room. The fundamentals of their businesses might not even look a lot better, but when you're in that room, you feel so differently about it. So I think how much really the founder matters.

(05:21):
And then the other thing, and this is my surprising thing about venture that I tell people that I didn't expect to learn, which is, especially on Twitter and even in the media and the press, some merger happens or doesn't happen, some deal happens or doesn't happen, and there's a lot of armchair quarterbacking where people are sort of filling in, "Oh, that happened because this fundamental shift in the market for X, Y, Z, because this research division and blah, blah, blah," a lot of things that seem really objective and really rational, but deals happen or don't happen typically because of interpersonal dynamics and sometimes even just personality clashes or petty holdouts from years before. And so I think how personal it is and how it's not always necessarily about the fundamentals of business. It's oftentimes because people just can see you as a founder, or CEO, or can see you running something like this. And so it's very subjective, more subjective than I thought it would be.

Lenny (06:32):
It's interesting. In both examples it comes back to the founder and how they present and how they behave. On the first point, presenting storytelling, being someone that VCs respect and want to invest in, is there anything that you have learned how to get better at that sort of thing, or is it just do it for a while and you'll get better? Is there something that folks can do to get stronger at that?

Merci Grace (06:54):
Yeah. When you have the opportunity to tell the story, when you have a pitch, when you're writing a blog post, when you're speaking at a conference, really, it's your stage. You get to manage the narrative and to say things in a certain way, position things in a certain way. And so that's where writing is really important. So even for a pitch or a conference talk or something like that, always start with an outline, always get really clear about, what's the arc of the story that you're telling?

(07:25):
And honestly, looking at things like movies and TV shows, every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention. And so I think that's one of the things that people often try to fit whatever the template they think is. And often in business, it ends up being, "Oh, what's this more staid, boring way to say this?" And in truth, great storytellers are not boring and they don't seem businessy.

Lenny (08:09):
I love that very tactical piece of advice. Start with the action and the climax and work backwards from that, almost. Are there any examples of that that you recall of a founder doing that or a story that does that, just to make it even more concrete?

Merci Grace (08:21):
That is how great pitches always go. So oftentimes, and this is just every sort of mediocre pitch, mediocre pitch deck that you see will start with, "Oh, here's the market," or something like that, right? Which is like, this isn't a presentation about the market. This is a presentation about you. And so if you are going to say that you're the only founder that could start this company, or you have this really unique insight, start there. Even though it feels like you haven't built up to it yet, or anything like that, you don't have to, you'll backfill all of that later. But getting their attention so that they close the tab, they put down their phone, that's the most important thing. You can still lose them later in the narrative, but getting attention, just going to market and getting attention for a startup is the kind of P0 for any of those interactions.

Lenny (09:16):
I love that. So start with the insight. That's a really good piece of advice. I could see a lot of decks improve having done that. And I know a lot of VCs look for, "what is the unique insight this founder has?" And so that's a really good idea to start with that and blow people's minds a little bit.

Merci Grace (09:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (09:32):
Speaking of amazing founders, I want to segue a bit and to talk about Slack and your experience there with Stewart. What's something about Slack that maybe most people don't know?

Merci Grace (09:44):
Oh, yeah. It's funny, especially now, many years later, but Slack internally in 2015 kind of timeframe, it wasn't totally clear to people that the social aspect of Slack wasn't something that was important or meaningful to Slack internally. And so people would email us or talk to us at parties about, "Hey, have you seen Discord? They're coming for you." I'm like, "It's similar. It's not going after the same market." And people would actually join the company with some very concrete ideas or expectations about the social use case for Slack. And so, one of the best things, honestly, that the early founding team at Slack did and were able to give to those of us who followed them was the understanding that this is a tool for work. And that made thousands of small decisions instant and obvious.

(10:47):
There was this internal campaign that was very irritating to me at the time from people saying, "We absolutely need to allow people to block each other on Slack." All these people who are using open source communities, all these different sort of use cases for it. And I went on a bit of a rant, I would call it in... I think it was our culture channel, which was just its own sort of total shit show, but this channel where people would this meta thinking about Slack, and there was this consistent question about blocking. And so I went on quite a little tirade about how blocking is a tool. And so, yes, if someone is, you feel, harassing you and you would like to block them in the immediate moment, it will make you feel better. It'll make you feel a little more safe.

(11:41):
But businesses have an HR function and they should absolutely know. You're first of all sort of brushing it under the rug and letting this person go off and treat other people in this negative manner. And then the sort of counterpoint that I also provided is that blocking isn't always used by people to protect themselves. It could be used by people who don't like you at work to exclude you from important meetings or discussions. Your performance drops off. You eventually get put on a PIP or you have issues continuing to perform your job at work because people singled you out and multiple people blocked you and excluded you from the conversation. And I think that argument eventually made headway with people, but the fact that it was such an open conversation at the company really helped me see that it wasn't obvious to everyone that Slack was a work tool because it feels so social and it feels so fun.

Lenny (12:45):
I love that reversal and coming back to why this might hurt you versus why you may think you really need this feature. What this makes me think about is I actually use Slack for social feature in a big way. My newsletter subscribers, there's about seven, 8,000 people in a Slack.

Merci Grace (13:01):
Wow.

Lenny (13:02):
And it's the use case that you don't believe Slack should have done. I'm curious, and no hard feelings, do you feel like they will focus on this in the future? Or should they, maybe in the future? I'm guessing there's just not a lot of money to be made there. And so I could see why that's not a focus, but do you think that'll change?

Merci Grace (13:21):
Yeah, it's interesting. So you are participating in this creator economy that wasn't around at the same level in 2015. The kinds of communities that were happening on Slack would be a Burning Man community, an open source community that was massive and everyone had a weird Linux set up, and so it was usually time-consuming for our support team to help get people's machines working and things like that. So I don't know, because what you have is a little bit of a prosumer use case, right, where people have a personal but also very much a professional community with you as well. And I think that Discord is moving more in that direction. It's a little bit more of a natural step for them to take, I think. And it's funny, because for me, Slack doesn't exist anymore in the way that it did even a few years ago. It's not an independent company anymore. And so I think the question would be whether it aligns with the long-term interests of Salesforce.

Lenny (14:20):
Yep, that makes sense. We don't have to get into it too deep here, but I really like Slack for my use case because my subscribers are generally already in Slack. They're at work. Discord is just such a noisy thing and such a new product for people to use. People often love to hate on Slack because it's this big old thing and they're using it for work, but it's actually amazing for my use case, and so I'm going to keep using it. And Discord-

Merci Grace (14:44):
I know I still have the Women in Product community on Slack as well for that same reason and because it's professional and adjacent and it is tied into your professional identity as a person, but also, yeah, you're already on it. So reengaging your community is more a question of an app channel or a mention than it is having to reengage using an email campaign or something like that in order to get someone's attention.

Lenny (15:09):
Going in a slightly different direction and into growth, correct me if I'm wrong but Slack was one of the early innovators in this whole product-led growth movement. Is that accurate?

Merci Grace (15:21):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (15:22):
Okay, cool. So what I'm curious to hear is what was it like early on helping figure out how to grow this thing that became this behemoth massively successful company and figuring out this idea of product-led growth? And then I'll ask a couple questions as we chat through this.

Merci Grace (15:37):
Yeah. So early on, I mean, I definitely got the job that I got at Slack because I had been a game designer. And Stewart Butterfield, the CEO and founder, and I knew each other from our shared time having both run, it turned out, very unsuccessful gaming committees, and being people, I think, who have the same weird taste in indie games and things like that. And so he knew, and this was part of our discussion, that I would bring a familiar sensibility to the role I was hired to, which wasn't called growth at first, it was new user experience. So it was the onboarding experience, signing up, getting started. And that's really where we started with it, was coming at it from not trying to do a specific number or anything like that but a belief that this is a great product and we had product market fit, that was pretty obvious at the time, and so how do we help clear away the fog of war and let people see the map that is, "Here's Slack, and here's where everything is, and here's how you can get started using it"?

Lenny (16:50):
That is so interesting that so much of that was rooted in game design. I had no idea. That's so interesting that you both had that experience. It definitely shows in the experience. So at that point I imagine product growth was not a thing. It was just, "How do we grow this thing?"

Merci Grace (17:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (17:05):
What did you learn from that experience of just how to grow a thing like Slack that is user first and the way that a lot of companies are trying to grow these days?

Merci Grace (17:13):
Yeah. I think one of the best things that we did is that we really started with curiosity first, and we weren't like, "Okay, here are all of our baseline metrics. We already know what's important. Let's just do this." Because April Underwood, former CPO at Slack, had this great line that she would say internally, which is, "No one has built Slack before." I really loved that as this kind of mental starting place where it's like, there isn't going to be this cookie cutter thing. And it was funny too, in the experience of building out onboarding and running all these experiments at Slack, to see people copy things from the product that we knew were not working.

(17:59):
And so I think when I first joined early 2015, we had an onboarding experience that had these little circles that would animate. It was very light, too light. There were too many of them. I remember my first few weeks doing customer support in Zendesk, and I would get screenshots from people reporting some unrelated bug and notice this person has been a user for six months and I can see they still have these little throbbers all over the place. Okay, this is not working. People don't understand that they're supposed to click on them. I think Discord has a similar design, but they use the little World of Warcraft style exclamation point, which I'm sure is much more effective. But it was hilarious and also kind of sad to watch people trying to replicate things in our product that actually weren't even working for us, but they had no insight into that.

Lenny (18:52):
I had the same exact experience at Airbnb. People just sit there, copy everything Airbnb's doing and have no idea. There's so many failed experiments that haven't been unlaunched, and we're just trying to figure things out.

Merci Grace (19:04):
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We're all trying to learn. I think it is very dangerous to say this specific metric is a North Star for every business. I think one of the most surprising things, and of course when something's true it becomes obvious and not at all surprising, but we had thought of Slack as a sync but also async kind of a platform, but then over the course of a bunch of experimentation and user research saw that a bunch of the things that moved the needle for us were about getting people into their new Slack team at the same time. So, Jules Walter, PM on the GRIF team, did some experiments around push notifications on mobile, just getting people in. It's still live in the product today because it was, it turns out, massively successful. It really matters that someone is there to greet you when you join.

Lenny (19:57):
Did you have a rule of thumb how many people needed to be in a Slack for it to start to take off?

Merci Grace (20:02):
We had a activation metric that we got to through some initial regression analysis, and then we tested the hypotheses that we developed from that regression analysis and made it into the product. And so for us it was three people, real human beings, not bots, and 50 messages, real messages, not people, because that was our real messages, not bot messages. Three people ended up being the lowest number at which things do start to break. So having a one-on-one conversation is a lot easier, having one-on-one text message or email, any other thing is going to be more straightforward. There's almost nothing, and especially when we were comparing ourselves so actively and successfully at the time to email, there is nothing broken about a 35 message one-on-one email conversation. It's totally fine. It's a series of letters back and forth. As soon as you add one more person to that, it gets a lot messier.

Lenny (21:08):
I forgot about that initial vision of Slack, trying to replace email.

Merci Grace (21:13):
I know.

Lenny (21:13):
That's not even something we talk about anymore. Interesting.

Merci Grace (21:14):
We never talk about it. Yeah. And now it's funny. I'll see some of the media that gets created or the television commercials and I'm like, "What is..." Balls moving around and little grooves and stuff. And I'm like, "I'm not sure what they're supposed to be comparing themselves to. Maybe just themselves."

Lenny (21:34):
Right. I think Slack is Slack now, and you don't need to replace email. I think they found a niche.

Merci Grace (21:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (21:40):
That also reminds me, I actually tried using Slack with my wife. It was just me and my wife in Slack. We tried to use that as our main communication hub, and it was a little much. We moved away.

Merci Grace (21:50):
Yeah, it is. It's funny how it's just a little too much architecture, a little, yeah, too big of a house for two people, kind of.

Lenny (21:59):
That's right. Yeah. But it was fun. We had channels for events and love. We had a love channel. Anyway.

Merci Grace (22:05):
No.

Lenny (22:07):
So you mentioned this push notification feature being really effective. Is there anything else that just stands out to you as, these are just lessons I've learned in how to grow a product that's kind of prosumer product-led bottom-uppy, things that stick with you that you bring to future products?

Merci Grace (22:22):
Oh, yeah. One of the big ones in that regard is the understanding that there are people who are just more social, right? I'm sure you're this kind of person. You're a connector and you know a lot of people, you love introducing them, bringing them together. We are who we are, fundamentally. And so within any population, including a user base, there will be people who are more likely to invite other people to the product or to bring people around into it, especially if it's something like a collaboration product. And so I thought it was much easier to get those people to share the product with bigger groups of folks than it would be to get someone who's just not like that, who never is the host, who doesn't invite people to stuff. It's a lot easier to get someone to send more invites than it is to get someone who's a little shy to even send one.

Lenny (23:16):
So what that makes me think about is just pick the right persona, an ICP. A person, especially for a social oriented product, will invite people into the product. Is that how you think about it?

Merci Grace (23:27):
Yeah, exactly. It's knowing the persona and then it's also doing things like making sure that someone has multiple opportunities to invite, even though it's a counterintuitive thing. Across many types of products I have seen user interviews where people are going through an onboarding experience, and they come to the invite screen and they say, "Oh, I would never invite someone. I haven't seen the inside of this product. I wouldn't do this," et cetera. That is advice to not listen to. You need to have invites early and often so that you catch people who want to share it, are social people. And then for the people who would never participate in that, they can ignore it or skip it. But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be all over the entire product.

Lenny (24:17):
And it's optional at that point, right? It's just like, if you want to invite, invite, but you don't have to.

Merci Grace (24:23):
Yeah, yeah. I'm never a dark pattern person. I think it was Marco Polo, the async video chat app, did a bunch of dark pattern stuff, I remember, maybe three or four years ago where they would auto-select a ton of people and send them a text message that looked like it was from you. It was really awful. So I'm definitely not a dark pattern growth at any cost kind of a person, but it is like have the invites there for the people who will want to and the people who, even though they sound pretty offended in their tone of voice when they talk about, it's not enough for them to not engage with your product.

Lenny (25:00):
I find the same pattern effective with credit cards for a subscription app and B2C subscription. Just like, "This is a trial. You can enter your credit card now if you want, or you could do later." I find that drives a lot of growth in revenue because a lot of people are just like, "Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Let's just do it."

Merci Grace (25:15):
Yeah, exactly. I think people often, and this is probably even a larger statement about human beings, but we're so focused on ourselves, right? I think that's one thing that parents tell middle schoolers is, "I know you feel really awkward right now, but so does everyone else. No one's thinking about you. They're just thinking about themselves and how they come off." And then we'll do that to our own detriment in business where you'll set up something like a timed trial and say, "Okay. Well, I want to start getting revenue as soon as possible. So we'll just let people have this for a week." But the truth is for every week that you continue to let people use it, you get incrementally more people who do convert because their timing on buying your product has nothing to do with your schedule or how quickly you want revenue and everything to do with, where in the quarter is it for them? Do they have a new project that they can use to try out your product?

Lenny (26:12):
I love that advice. Just step out of yourself and recognize people have different motivations and are in different stages of the journey and may just be ready to go. And if you give them a chance it may actually work out really well. I wanted to chat a bit about onboarding. You mentioned that you initially started working on onboarding and that kind of turned into this growth team. I find onboarding often ends up being one of the biggest levers for retention, obviously for activation, and then just broadly growth. Is there anything that you've learned over time of just how to think about onboarding and how to optimize onboarding, how to approach onboarding as a growth team and maybe just as a startup?

Merci Grace (26:49):
Yeah. My thoughts and feelings about onboarding really go back to my experience designing games where I would design the game from the onboarding experience. So there wasn't a sense of, okay, here's exactly the game and all of the game dynamics. But how you introduce something, how you frame something matters a lot. How will someone discover this? And so if you can think about even an online product that you're working on from that first introduction, "What will it be like for someone to come in here? What will I be asking them to integrate with? Will I be asking them to upload something, to invite someone else? What are the steps between the user and the full value of your app?" is something that's very useful to think about literally from the first days that you're designing the product.

(27:46):
Unfortunately, many people think about onboarding at the last minute and it ends up being the final piece of product work, or, and this may be a little bit controversial of an opinion, but I'm not a fan of the plug and play frameworks for onboarding for that reason. I've seen them advertised actually using, "Here's how to replicate Slack's onboarding in using our tool," and things like that. And I'm like, "Oh God, don't do that because what worked for Slack won't necessarily work for you." And it certainly won't be native and feel deeply tied into the product experience, which it absolutely should be.

Lenny (28:29):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I ask product managers and designers on Twitter what software they use most, Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, whiteboarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs, and that includes thousands of built-in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer. Visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up. That's whimsical.com/lenny. For somebody that's trying to improve their onboarding and think about onboarding, are there examples of companies and flows that you think of that are really good, maybe other than Slack?

Merci Grace (29:25):
Yeah. The ones that I really find a lot of delight in tend to be ones that are deeply intertwined with the product. So throughout the course of using the product you learn you get onboarded to the value of it. Probably the clearest tools in which you can see this dynamic are things like to-do lists, where there will be an item on the to-do list that says, "Click the square next to this to mark this task as complete." And now you've just completed your first task and it's really in there, and it doesn't feel like this fake kind of veneer on top of it. I really like something that is not pasted on top of the experience but something that uses the product to teach someone else how to use the product.

Lenny (30:13):
You're telling me there's no easy plug and play silver bullet solutions? God damn it.

Merci Grace (30:18):
Yeah, I'm sorry. It turns out it's just hard work. The other thing that people don't do enough is stay in touch with the real human experience of what onboarding is for your product. So it's very easy, especially if you work at a company that has a high volume of signups every day, to just always look at the conversion number and that anonymized pile of people winding their way through your actually made up benchmarks for them. It is messier and way more awkward to have to talk to human beings, but absolutely necessary. You want to hear the tone of voice. You want to see the expression on their face. So once a month, ideally, you should just have some sort of a schedule for yourself where if you're at a larger company and you have a user researcher who can recruit people for you, that's great, but if not, just go find people who either fit the demographic for your user or even are your user and have them sign up for an account and walking through it. And it is embarrassing, but very educational.

Lenny (31:26):
That's awesome advice. It makes me think about Teresa Torres and her framework around continuous discovery habits, where she has this whole framework of setting up count leads, where people could just book you and you automatically talk to a customer every week. And we're going to have her on a different episode, maybe before this, maybe after this. I'm not sure how it's all going to play out. But yeah, that's a great reminder to invest in actually talking to customers. And that's a good segue. I wanted to come back to the whole idea of product-led growth, especially because it's so popular and hot and everyone wants to be product-led these days because it's cheaper and grows quickly and there are big sales teams. So first question is what have you found in looking at companies, talking to companies, advising companies, what are the most common mistakes would you say startups make when they think about figuring out product-led growth?

Merci Grace (32:13):
Oh, yeah. So one of the most common things that I see folks do when they haven't had much experience really simplifying onboarding down or something like that is they'll often have an idea of, "Okay, here are the seven things that you have to know about our product." And one of those is usually some power user feature that an executive really likes or something. They'll have this idea that they want to have a carousel that meets you when you open up the product and it takes you through all of these informational panes. And what's funny is that then if you were to talk to those same people in a usability study for some other product, they'd be like, "Oh, yeah. No. Click. I'm not going to read that."

(32:58):
But again, that's that sort of, we have this expectation of our users that they're going to give a shit, that they're going to read the text, that they're going to be at the level of investment in our product that we are, which is just categorically false. You have to understand that people have really limited attention and no one cares about your product the way that you do. And so it can feel like you're dumbing it down or oversimplifying. And if you don't feel that way about your onboarding, about the growth work that you're doing, it's probably too complex.

Lenny (33:34):
Do you find that if you have a carousel, something's gone wrong? Or are there times when a carousel and a little guide makes sense?

Merci Grace (33:41):
If the carousel is in a product where that's the modality of the product, so I could see a carousel, honestly, working for something like Tinder, where that's basically what the product is, right, you're swiping through it, sure, you can use a carousel for that, right? But only because it matches the user experience of the core product. But most apps that use carousels at the beginning, it is actually this pane that's built to be dismissed quickly.

Lenny (34:15):
Interesting. So what should people do when they're just like, "Oh, you're going to create this whole introduction carousel"? Is your advice simplified such that you don't really need that, broadly?

Merci Grace (34:26):
If you haven't been able to talk someone out of it, you can always show them. So I'm a huge fan of learning without shipping and building paper prototypes or building prototype in Figma, or ProtoPie, or something like that, and just do a bake off and prove the point, not with you saying, "Hey, CEO, you're wrong about X, Y, Z. We shouldn't have this three image carousel." Just come up with some different alternatives, like tool tips that are embedded in product, things that are obvious next steps that you can guide people to within a sort of constrained user experience, and then you'll just be able to actually compare whether people understood it, experience A, or whether more people understood experience B. And it can be shockingly clear.

Lenny (35:18):
Awesome. Yeah. I think in that you can probably tell people aren't going to want to sit through a carousel and check every step. They're just like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to figure it out."

Merci Grace (35:26):
Yeah. Or even ask someone, "Oh, what was the last carousel that you remember?"

Lenny (35:33):
"That you finished?"

Merci Grace (35:34):
Yeah. Just like, "What was the last one?"

Lenny (35:36):
Right.

Merci Grace (35:37):
"Oh, that's right. I always close them."

Lenny (35:40):
I love that. Coming back to product-led growth and figuring out how to do that well, what are signs that your product and just general business can be product-led versus like, "Okay, we're going to try it. It's probably not going to work out. We're probably going to have to hire salespeople quickly"?

Merci Grace (35:56):
Ideally, that's something that you've thought about pretty deeply before you even started to code the product, because whether you thought about it consciously or not, you have already decided whether it is going to be product-led or sales-led. If it is the type of a solution that you need buy-in from the head of HR to use because you need to integrate with systems that have a lot of PII in them and no IC has the keys to that system at any size of a company, boom, you know have a sales-led motion. That is what it is.

(36:32):
And so I think just having that sort of objective distance to your own product is always a fruitful kind of place to begin. If you have a product that even if it's for a specific function but anyone at any seniority level in that function could pick it up to use it, so DevTools are probably the most successful product-led growth companies that we don't talk about being product-led, but that's totally how they grow. A junior engineer or a really senior engineer can pick up some dev tool and play around with it and start using it, decide to take it into work or not.

(37:09):
So anything that you can pick up without needing to have the keys to Dad's Porsche in order to test out can be product-led. More and more I'm also seeing companies that have a enterprise sales motion to capture the customer at the point of adoption, but then they want to use product-led growth frameworks or tools to expand their usage to either drive up retention or to actually expand the number of seats and the number of departments that are using that tool. And that's actually a very good use for all of the same sort of frameworks and user experience concepts.

Lenny (37:53):
We're throwing out a lot of these terms, and I realize it might be helpful just to try to set a little context. I don't know if you have a clean definition of these things, but how do you define product-led versus bottom-up versus sales-driven, I think is pretty obvious, but how do you define these terms and think about them?

Merci Grace (38:10):
Yeah. For product-led, I think about it being something that anyone can get value out of your tool immediately and that the tool doesn't need to be augmented by a conversation, or a webinar, or anything like that with someone else in order for them to get to a certain threshold of value. Often you learn a lot as a business from doing a white-glove onboarding for certain personas, and they didn't need you to do that, but you wanted to do it. So, that's still really product-led.

(38:46):
And then it's funny, bottoms-up is often used in exactly the same way, but I would think of bottoms-up as being not just product-led but also something that can be adopted by anyone at any level within the organization. So there's tools for people managers, like a range, and a bunch of other ones, whereas a manager is running their one-on-ones, getting feedback from their team, et cetera, using this tool. That's a product-led tool often, but that's not really bottoms-up, because in order to grow that tool, you need to do a very good job of finding where managers are in businesses, targeting them, retargeting, and doing things to specifically reach out to someone in that particular function. Whereas, bottoms-up should be literally anyone at a 500 person company could start using this.

Lenny (39:40):
Got it. That's really helpful. I imagine the Venn diagram overlap of product-led and bottom-up is very overlapped. But in theory, you could have a sales-driven bottom-up strategy or a product-led top-down strategy. Is that right?

Merci Grace (39:57):
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Lenny (39:58):
Very cool. Okay. So we've talked through the context and just definitions of these things, when a company can be product-led. It sounds like the main thing you look for is can an individual adopt this product at a company? That's like a sign that this can be product-led.

Merci Grace (39:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (40:14):
Is there anything else that you think is important that if these things don't exist, you should probably not try to be product-led?

Merci Grace (40:23):
Yeah. The other one that I don't hear people talk about very often is whether there's really day zero value in the tool. This is something that came up for me a lot when I was looking at a lot of these sort of video apps. So both the Presence app, where you're replicating a kind of office experience, or pre-pandemic, now I think this use case is a little more obvious, but pre-pandemic, getting on video chat with someone. And what it does is creates an automatic transcript of your meeting.

(40:55):
There isn't necessarily a lot of day zero value from doing one meeting on a tool like that, but often the pitch would be, "Hey, in six months or three months, you'll be glad that you recorded the transcripts for all of these interviews that you did because of X, Y, Z reason." That is not something that is valuable if they've been using it for months. It is not something that can be product-led because there's product-led in one direction, there's product-led back out in that same direction. And that can be the frustrating part about product-led growth is that the easier you make it to come in, also the easier it can be to leave.

Lenny (41:37):
Got it. So you're finding that it's really important for people that adopt it to stick around. And basically, finding value immediately is a way to increase retention and keep people around. And you're finding that if people don't stick around, it's not really going to work. And you need people there, salespeople, basically, keeping them on the product and using it.

Merci Grace (41:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:56):
Very cool. Eventually most companies end up hiring a salesperson. I was doing some research on this, and I found 100% of product-led growth companies hire a salesperson and a massive sales team eventually, like 100%. Do you have any thoughts, insights, experience on when it might make sense to bring in that first salesperson?

Merci Grace (42:13):
Yeah. So founders are always selling. So even from the time that you have your very first alpha customers. And it's funny, because I often reference actually the post that you did about how to find your first fast B2B customers.

Lenny (42:28):
How recursive.

Merci Grace (42:29):
Yeah, I know, and here we are again. It's all in that initial network, right? So the founder is always the first salesperson. So in that way it is often the case that one of the first three or four people who work in a company is actually a salesperson. But the point at which you should start to hire someone else to do that is when you, as the founder, absolutely cannot meet the demand even though you're getting up really early and staying up really late and building your investing deck on the weekend instead so you can continue to meet with customers.

(43:01):
And then the other time to do that, apart from just being maxed out, is when you are moving in to and usually up to a customer that both wants and expects to meet with a salesperson. That was what we went through at Slack, was moving from that engineer-driven SMB motion to then getting adopted at companies that really wanted to have a conversation with someone before they continue to spend a lot of money on their product. I think that's one of the things that maybe younger founders or people who haven't worked at enterprise companies before can discount is the customer preference. And then actually there's a whole set of customers that literally have to talk to someone before they can buy anything or just really want to.

# Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's talk about product market fit.

Rahul Vohra (00:00:01):
You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users, and this is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. That's what we're here to do, is to make something that people want, but it can't be all people. And the question becomes, how do you listen to them? And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you? The trick here is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time. A lot of CEOs think they need to spend time on hiring or org building and you intentionally, "I will spend time on product and marketing design."

Rahul Vohra (00:00:36):
This is a technique that I call the switch lock. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. How can we capture that? So I came up with the following idea. What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
What's the most pivotal moment in your career, in your life?

Rahul Vohra (00:00:58):
I learned the real secret behind virality. There is no such thing as a truly viral product. What then is the true secret? It is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today my guest is Rahul Vohra. Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful and insightful and articulate founders that I've met. As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills and also his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.

(00:01:32):
This episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles. And also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company, including why they manually onboarded every single new user for years and why they decided to stop. Why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit, and also how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company. Also, the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy, what Rahul has learned about building scaled products on top of AI and LLMs and so much more.

(00:02:07):

(00:05:04):
Rahul, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Rahul Vohra (00:05:07):
Hello, hello and thank you for having me Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):
I have so many questions for you. We're going to have so much to talk about. I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman. When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you, what's the most pivotal moment in your career in your life? And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company Rapportive to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life and just why was it so pivotal?

Rahul Vohra (00:05:37):
So for folks that don't know, Rapportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people look like, where they work, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile and everything else that they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling in BD, super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I then ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. That by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career, prior to starting Superhuman.

(00:06:22):
Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with. Because I reported to LinkedIn's head of Growth, Elliot Shmukler. He was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to when I joined, north of 250 million members. And during my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint, it's not about viral mechanics. Overall that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):
Okay. Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there, what the secret is to virality. What did you learn there?

Rahul Vohra (00:07:08):
Well, in my first one-on-one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, "Hey, I'm here to learn. Please teach me everything that you know about virality." And he said, "Okay. Well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a truly viral product." I said, "What do you mean? How do you explain Facebook for that matter? How do you explain LinkedIn?" And he said, "What I mean is, no app has sustained a viral factor of greater than one for any real period of time." Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7. And he told me that lasted for perhaps a year, so one person was creating about 0.7 new users.

(00:07:57):
I double-clicked again and I said, "Well Elliot, what about the address book import?" This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book, and then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn. And he said, "That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time." So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4, and that's considered good.

(00:08:28):
 0.4 is good for a viral feature, 0.6 is great, something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere up with Facebook at that time. So I said, "Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to Peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding. Which actually makes sense, it would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?" And he said, "It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product." That really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
Wow, you're such a great storyteller. I'm just listening here, just captivated, "What is he going to say next?" That was fascinating. I actually have a post that I'm going to link to that, that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled, Virality is a Myth mostly. It's based, I forget, on this book where they do all this research on actual viruses. It turns out they're not actually spreading in this exponential way, there's one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.

(00:09:52):
That's actually apparently what the data shows. I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is, when people think of an app as going viral, it's one person with a massive platform sharing it and their audience adopts it and that's just one to many and then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral, but it's a person to many people, not many people to many people. Thoughts on that?

Rahul Vohra (00:10:14):
Yeah, we've definitely found that there are whales, to use the gaming terminology, that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, 100 people, and they may have various motivations for doing that. In Superhuman, as an individual subscriber, if you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket.

(00:10:39):
We have people who send many, many hundreds of invites and there are some people who essentially have free Superhuman for life now due to how many people they've invited. But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product, so you have to then come up with new motivations for those people. That's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last, probably about two years.

(00:11:15):
Early last year we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea is, we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default, Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack, was still firmly stuck in its single-player origins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):
I want to come back to something that you mentioned that I didn't come back to you that I think is really core to what you just shared, which is word of mouth being so important. People talk about all these viral features and sharing contact books and all these things. And your point is, that takes you to a place, but really what helps a consumer-ish product spread is word of mouth, people sharing with each other. Which, then the question is, how do you do that? We're going to talk about a lot of things that you did to make Superhuman something people want to share, but in the end it's just making something people want to share. That's the definition almost. Then it's like, what makes people want to share stuff? It's amazing, it's helping them, something that is remarkable.

Rahul Vohra (00:12:22):
Well, it turns out, because you mentioned remarkableness, that is one of our core company values. If you think about what a company has to do, it has to grow. How do things grow? Well, let's take Elliot's advice at face value, and I believe it's true, it's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something remarkable, and you used that word, and that is one of the core values of Superhuman.

(00:12:53):
We have, create delight, create something that is so joyful that really truly brings people delight. We have deliver remarkable quality, something that is so striking, so compelling and worthy of attention that people can't but help tell others about it. Then we have build the extraordinary, which is a measure of the efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. That's another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
I didn't know that was one of your values. That makes so much sense. Okay, we're going to come back to that, because I think that is... There's so much to learn about how you think about product and how you think about building the company that builds the product. But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be.

(00:13:41):
The CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv, tweeted months ago, he tweeted this and we're going to show this if you're on YouTube, "Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late. Does anyone else notice this?" I saw that, I'm like, "I completely have noticed this. It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just a new company." And I tagged you on the tweet. I'm like, "Hey Rahul, what's changed?" And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's a lot to learn about what you did.

(00:14:12):
Because a lot of companies are in this phase of just, "Things aren't moving as fast as we want. We used to be so much faster, we used to ship all these features and now we don't." So I think this is a really cool real case study illustrative example that we can analyze. So let me ask you this, what did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster?

Rahul Vohra (00:14:37):
I think what we noticed was this sentiment, and we felt it first ourselves, but we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, from our customers, that we'd slowed down. And as a founder, as a CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear. It's our job after all to speed things up. When I ask people what do they mean by slowing down, they didn't mean the product, of course, the product wasn't working any slower, but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.

(00:15:09):
I think to break this down, it's important to start by defining what we mean by a slowdown. There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces, and then there is the kind of slowdown that is quite avoidable. We actually had both. So starting with unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market widening. Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better.

(00:15:50):
There are some spaces, there are some markets, there are some platforms where market widening is really fast and really easy, and there are some spaces, email is one of them where market widening is really hard and really slow. But when we started we had a great deal of focus. We only supported Gmail, we were only on the web. In those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy, every engineering dollar, into solution deepening, making the product better for existing users. And of course users loved it. It's how we got to product market fit. It's how most startups do.

(00:16:24):
But at a certain point, almost every company then has to start investing in widening the market. For example, the market of people who will use a new Gmail front end but without a mobile app, does exist, but it is relatively small. This is something that every new email startup is going to learn sooner or later. In order to keep on growing, you are going to have to need to add an iOS app and then a MacOS app, and then a Windows app, and then an Android app. Then you'll soon want to support Office 365. But that's not one thing, that's actually three things, because you have to support Office 365 on desktop and then on iOS and then on Android. That's all much easier said than done.

(00:17:04):
I think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no other company knows, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. So fast-forward to today, and Superhuman now works wherever you do on every combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, Web, iOS, Android, and this actually turns out to be a really great technology moat. Almost no other email app can claim this. It's taken many years of intense investment. I think we'll touch on this later, but it's one of the main reasons why we can sell into the enterprise, because we now know everyone can use it.

(00:17:37):
But this is the hard part, when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution deepening, so your perceived product velocity may decrease. You can avoid some of these things with some smart technology decisions, but mostly you just have to grind through it, and it is worth it to get to the other side. Then there's the kind of slowdown that is avoidable. If I remember my answer to Rajiv's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about. In that case it was our management structure, or who does what.

(00:18:07):
When we hired our initial executive teams, I followed very conventional wisdom. I ended up with a set of VPs and eight, I think direct reports, maybe even nine. I thought that's what you were meant to do. That's how startups are meant to scale. But as anyone who's been there knows, eight direct reports is a lot. It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting, it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations, and fortunately also it's a lot of firing. No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try. That time I had for the things that I think I can genuinely be world-class at things like product and design and technology and marketing, that all began to rapidly disappear, and as a result the organization began to slow down.

(00:18:54):
Unfortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely, I had this crazy way of tracking it. At one point I noticed I was spending six to 7% of my week on these areas, these areas where I can truly be world-class at. So I had two realizations. Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale, and we were definitely at that scale, you can actually define what you want the role of a CEO to be at your company. And number two, the Superhuman opportunity deserves everyone who works at the company to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius, so that includes me as well as everybody else. What I did is, I hired a really great president, I went from eight direct reports to two, and the amount of time that I spend on product design, technology and marketing went up from six to 7% to about 60% to 70% of my week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):
Just to mirror back a few things. One is, people may feel like you are not shipping as much as you used to because you're actually building things they don't care about, which is support for office and all these things that they don't need, but the business needs to expand, integrations with Microsoft and Android and all these things. I think that's such a good point, that it looks like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff happening for other users that aren't you.

(00:20:15):
Then there's this point about people delegate. Then a leader of delegates, hires all these execs and they're like, "This is not what I wanted. Why have I done this?" And you think it's going to speed up, but it slows down. A couple threads here that are really interesting. One is this time tracking thing, I need to know how do you do this? The fact that you knew seven to 8% or whatever the number is, to that granularity of your time you're spending on things you wanted was that low, how do you do time tracking? Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?

Rahul Vohra (00:20:48):
This is a technique that I call the Switch log. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. So how can we capture that? And actually, how can we create a system of work that isn't tethered to a calendar, where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says you do or you don't have to do? So I came up with the following idea, what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted? What if every single time I change task I just Slack DM'd my EA, but this also works in Slackbot, it just has to go somewhere. I Slack DM'd my EA and I said, "TS:," and then a few words for the task I was doing.

(00:21:45):
Well, that would create certain changes. Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar and think, "Oh, should I stop this task, start that task, I can just do what I want." If what I feel right now is, "Oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast, I'll go ahead and do that." And if I get bored or distracted eight minutes in, which sometimes happens because something else just bubbles up to the top of my mind, well, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it up to the top of my mind. I also practice transcendental meditation, so I'm very keen on the idea of being aware and listening to what's bubbling up.

(00:22:20):
So it's okay for me to then go and attend to that thought as opposed to start to expend my focus points or my discipline or willpower on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing. All I'd have to do is I'd go back to Slack, "TS: Dealing with this other thing." And by the way, you should obviously turn up for your meetings. I'm not saying just blow through your meetings and not turn up for your one-on-ones. Definitely do those things. What I'm saying is, do what feels right for as long as it feels right to do. Then at the end of the week you can see where your time is going.

(00:22:55):
I realized at one point that I was spending only in those days 5% of my time on recruiting, whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30% or more of my time on recruiting. But the biggest thing was, I saw I was only spending six to 7% of my time on product, on design, on technology and marketing. These are things where I know I'm really good at them. I should either be teaching people how to do them or doing them or some combination of both. That's probably the best thing for me. It keeps me really happy, very joyful, it keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization. So that's how we had that kind of an insight. Once you have this Slack Log, you can then graph it and chart it and see where your time is actually going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
How cool. Clearly this is an app opportunity or an agent opportunity where you're just telling this thing every time. It's essentially tracking context, which we're always hearing, try not to avoid context which switches.

Rahul Vohra (00:23:50):
I think context switches are fine. There's definitely this idea that, for every interruption you have, the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average to recover, to get back to the efficacy before that you were disturbed. It's a big deal, of course, I'm building productivity software, we designed Superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction and disruption that's possible within the app. But if you are working on something and at the back of your mind something bubbles up, you have to attend to it in one way or the other. Sometimes I just write it down, actually, I don't have my notebook with me, but it's really big. I have a gigantic, whatever twice the size of A4 is, I guess A3 sketchbook and I always have a 4H pencil, so whenever one of those thoughts comes up, I just scribble it down. Or I actually stop what I'm doing and I attend to that task, because there's a reason it's bubbling up right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:44):
I love that you know exactly the type of paper and pencil, 4H pencil, A3 paper, [inaudible 00:24:51]. Okay, this is going to be a theme. You mentioned meditation, you said you do TM, so you do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes... Do you do it that style or you do a longer session?

Rahul Vohra (00:25:01):
I do about half an hour in the morning, including rest time. The physical rest component of it is very important to me. So it's 20 minutes of the actual meditation, then 10 minutes of rest. I do that in the morning as well as in the afternoon at around 3:00 PM

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
And you just carve that out in your calendar. Everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock, he's going to be out.

Rahul Vohra (00:25:17):
Absolutely. My EA knows, they're the one who's organizing the calendar and making sure things happen when they need to happen. They also know that nothing can override this TM block. Without it I genuinely start to fall apart. But with it, I'm able to access some very deep competencies that I didn't have before. I've been doing this now for about four or five years, and initially I simply felt happier, occasionally even more euphoric coming out of a really great meditation session. But over time I found that my ability to focus was increasing. I could hold attention on something for much longer, but I also was able to become much more creative and much more expressive.

(00:26:02):
These are well-known side effects, as it were, or intended effects for some people of TM. And interestingly about TM, if you compare it to other forms of meditation, they don't have quite the same impact across quite as many executive functions. So there's something particularly interesting that's going on with transcendental meditation as opposed to other forms that folks are still trying to unravel and figure out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
If folks want to, if they're inspired and they want to check out this form of meditation, any advice on where they could go learn?

Rahul Vohra (00:26:32):
Absolutely, a lot. But in summary, have a coach teach you. I had many false starts myself with meditation, trying the various apps, learning from books. None of it really worked for me. What worked was having one-on-one teaching from someone themselves who had been taught one-on-one the Yogic or the Raja tradition of teaching. This person in particular had also been a venture-backed founder multiple times over, so they're very well aware of the kinds of stresses that I tend to be under. And all of his clients are mostly in technology as well. If you're in the Bay Area, this person's name is Laurent Valasek. They run an institution called the Peak Leadership Institute. And this is all about how we can live a more integrated and whole life. Integrating wellness practices like meditation, but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance in life and in business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):
Thank you for sharing that. That is very actionable. We're going to link to that in the show notes.

(00:27:35):
Okay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might be hearing this and be like, "Going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't want to, spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing, amazing." What did this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility and that allowed you to do the stuff you wanted to do?

Rahul Vohra (00:27:58):
The biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and the rest of the company. Think of the president role in Superhuman as an operationally extremely challenging and a very growthful role. It is perfect for someone who wants to go on to be a CEO in their next role. Instead of hiring and firing that team, instead of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone else who's now doing that.

(00:28:35):
In addition, because that's not the only job, in addition, they're also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy. When it comes to, where do we take act one, our email product? How far do we go down the multiplayer path? How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with AI? Are we from a financial perspective okay dipping now and then coming back later? When should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should we keep on hiring in the Bay Area, or as we've done for many of our recent hires, should we continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so on and so on and so on. I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the list is truly endless.

(00:29:27):
Another way to think about it is, it's almost like a grown-up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and Vivek, they've long since gone from Superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization and I'm one those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said, the journey never gets easier, it gets different and you still need that co-founding energy around you. I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles providing that kind of energy, that kind of input, and who thrive off doing so. Then the president role is definitely one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:07):
Incredibly interesting. There's so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll share and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool the solution to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, it's essentially you can find people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured and that could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you. Then I think it's also really interesting, there's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling depleted or just don't have the partner you want, you could bring someone on that could be that person.

Rahul Vohra (00:30:50):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
Okay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected. I want to zoom out a little bit, and there's a couple themes that came up again and again when I talked to folks that you've worked with, investors in Superhuman. The two themes are contrarian thinking, in terms of building the company, and strong attention to detail. Let's spend a little time on attention to detail. Like I said, this is one of the things that came up again and again when I was asking people about you. So I have this quote from Ed Sims, and maybe your first investor. Were they your first investor?

Rahul Vohra (00:31:27):
Yeah, that there's a bunch of people on Twitter who are going to fight for that. But to set the record straight, Ed Sim did actually write the first three checks into Superhuman.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
First three checks? At subsequent rounds.

Rahul Vohra (00:31:38):
Well, yeah. Quick sidebar on that, he runs Boldstart Ventures alongside his partner Elliot Durbin. They have a particular interest in backing second-time founders, but they'll also back first-time founders, and they love application and infrastructure areas like Superhuman, so we were like the perfect investment. He also wrote a check from his previous fund into a Rapportive, and I think I'd made him five X that money. Nothing to write home about, but definitely, "I'm going to back this guy again." So I went to him and I said, "Hey listen, this is going to sound crazy. I want to take on Gmail." He said, "Do you have a deck?" I was like, "Yeah, here it is one slide, here it is." And there was a screenshot of Gmail with most of it scribbled out, "I want to build that and it's going to be amazing."

(00:32:25):
So he said, "Cool, we're in. Can I wire you the money?" And I said, "No, I don't even have a bank account yet." I come back two days later with a bank account and he's like, "Cool, I want to wire you 750 K." And I said, "I don't even know what I'm going to do with that money. I'm not paying myself, I won't for a while. We don't have any employees. I can't think of anything I want to spend it on. Tell you what, I'll just take 250 K." And he was like, "What?" I'm like, "Yeah, I'll just take 250 K." We start having the conversation around venture economics. I'm like, "Yeah, it's fine, we'll figure it out." Then a few months back I took another 250 K and a few months back I took another 250 K as I began inventing ways and finding channels to deploy capital properly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):
I love this story. I love all these stories you're sharing I've never heard before. And by the way, it is awesome. We're talking about him coming on the podcast, maybe breaking our VC rule. So specifically the story he shared with me that is maybe an example of you and your attention to detail is, he said that you created your own font because existing fonts weren't good enough. Is that true?

Rahul Vohra (00:33:31):
Kind of. Okay. The font that we use today is a modified version of Adelle Sans. The story there is, I looked at all of the major font families, and honestly none of them was what I would call truly excellent. That may sound like an odd thing to say. So let's, if you will permit me to talk about typography and email-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Please.

Rahul Vohra (00:33:56):
The first thing we did was, we took our UI and we laid it out in about 15 different styles using examples of the major font families. We actually printed these out and we left them on a desk in the middle of our office. Sometimes with design, you want to tune in to your immediate most visceral response, but sometimes you want to truly let a design marinate. And this was the latter. So we let these designs marinate, we let these font choices percolate. Like I said, none of them was truly excellent.

(00:34:31):
Number one, I was looking for a font that was in and of itself gorgeous. Number two, I was looking for a font that could also convey a message of any kind, without overpowering the sentiment of that message. For example, does the font work when this is inviting you to a party? Many fonts, including almost all serif fonts, are actually too somber or too sober for that. Or to pick another extreme, does the font work if it is informing you of somebody's passing, many fonts are just too jaunty for that. You wouldn't want that kind of message in Comic Sans, for example. And number three, I was optimizing for a font that made reading speed and comprehension really fast. And number four, I was looking for a font that made email addresses themselves look great. So I discarded all the 15 because they weren't good enough, and after searching high and low, I came across a font called Adelle Sans, which is designed by a foundry called Type Together, type-together.com. They have a whole bunch of lovely fonts, go check them out.

(00:35:36):
And if you go through my list, number one, Adelle Sans is gorgeous. I think each character is a work of art. It's beautifully formed. Number two, Adelle Sans is, I would say upbeat, it's optimistic, yet it's serious enough to convey any kind of message. It has just the right amount of personality, yet not too much personality. Number three, Adelle Sans is also unusually narrow, and that actually fits email particularly well. One of my pet peeves with Gmail, which by default uses Ariel, is that the lines are as wide as your window. So if you're in a wide screen, then the lines get really arbitrarily long. The problem with really wide and really long lines, is that they decrease reading speed. Because by the time you've reached the end of one line, your eyes have lost track of the start of the next line. And Ariel itself has fairly wide characters, which further exacerbates that.

(00:36:30):
So at Superhuman we, if you've used the product, you know this, we fix the line length or the typographical measure to the optimal length for reading speed, which depending on the font is around 90 to 120 characters. And Adelle Sans is quite narrow, so it actually lets us do this on quite small windows with fairly dense line. So we get a lot of information on fairly small windows without getting a very long typographical measure, optimizing for reading speed and for comprehension. Then number four, finally Adelle Sans has very unusual treatment of the at symbol in an email address. It actually puts the base of the A in the at on the same baseline as the rest of the text.

(00:37:15):
So for example, if your name has an A, my name does Rahul at Vohra, three A's and or two A's and an at, they're all actually on the same baseline. It's a small thing, but it makes the email addresses look incredibly natural. If you look at that and then you actually look at email addresses laid out in other fonts, those other the fonts look really clunky and awkward because the A is kind of shifted around and it just looks a bit silly in my opinion. Now Adelle Sans isn't perfect. So we then worked with a type designer on some of the specific details that there are some of the glyphs, which get a little pinchy as it were, and what we use today is very close to retail Adelle Sans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):
And this was pre-launch or this was after you'd already launched?

Rahul Vohra (00:37:58):
We'd probably had about 10, 15 users at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
So I think that's pretty contrarian unique to be this focused on the font and the typeface before you even launched. This was like, "Is this even going to be a thing? Will anyone even care?" And I think this says a lot about the way you think about product.

Rahul Vohra (00:38:17):
Oh yeah, that thought never crossed my mind. I think we'll probably come to it later, but the idea that, is this never going to be a thing? I think that's a dangerous thought. We can't start thinking that way, because at what point do you stop second-guessing yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:35):
Interesting. So you were confident this was going to work, so because I am so confident it'll work, I need them to get this right. There's also this trap founders fall into of just spending too much time perfecting a thing that never works and there's always advice launch early, launch often. Thoughts there? How do you find that balance? What's your advice there?

Rahul Vohra (00:38:57):
How much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model. For example, let's say you are building a marketplace in a greenfield opportunity, so imagine the Lyft or Uber in their heyday. There's a strong network effect, because the more cars you have on your platform, the shorter waiting times are, therefore people are going to preferentially use your app versus the other person's app. That's when there's no time to spare, that's when you probably shouldn't even be sleeping. You're going to hire the most aggressive maniacal people possible. You're going to work 120-hour weeks, because every marginal minute actually does matter. Every marginal minute in the market, growing compounding is going to make your next year even better.

(00:39:51):
That's actually not true of all startups and it certainly isn't true of something like Superhuman. Yes, working harder is always better and we work tremendously hard at Superhuman, but not to the point where it made sense to release something that didn't work. I'm reminded of a story of a founder that was in Y Combinator, told me about their demo day experience. They used Mailbox, which some folks may remember was also a startup, and Dropbox famously acquired them for about a hundred million dollars. The reason that they were well known, apart from the acquisition, is they were the first to popularize, swipe to archive or swipe to mark down, which of course is now standard in Superhuman and every other app.

(00:40:43):
This founder was using Mailbox and was having an amazing demo day. They're working the room, they're meeting investors, they're pitching their photography app in this case. He went home that night and went to his laptop, fired up mailbox and sent off a bunch of follow-up emails. He waited the day, didn't hear back, he waited two days, didn't hear back. On the third morning he figured something was up, so he fired up Gmail, went to his sent mail, and you guessed it, there were no sent mails there. So something had broken with mailbox. So he's cursing to himself trying to remind himself everything's going to be okay. Sent all the same emails from Gmail manually and they all came through.

(00:41:37):
But then one of the investors said, "Hey, by the way, you might want to check your email clients, because I've been getting some of your emails twice." Now he goes back into his Gmail, he sees that yes, actually the original emails that were queued up in mailbox have now indeed been sent, and some of the investors, and unfortunately most of the investors he actually pitched twice. Now, is this the end of the world? No, an investor can overlook that. Probably a good thing that you're trying new apps. But was it horrifying and was it really scary? Absolutely.

(00:42:08):
Imagine this wasn't investors, imagine this was a customer, someone who you were trying to convince to buy your thing and that you knew what you were doing and you had attention to detail and you had everything just buttoned up and under control. Well, now you've lost face, now you look foolish. That's why when you have mission-critical products like email where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission-critical. It's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
This is such an important nuance take on, there's always this debate, how much to focus on craft and user experience, how much to focus on time to launch and get it out and speed. What I'm hearing here, which I completely agree with is, it depends on the market you're in and the criticality essentially of your product. So if it's email, it just needs to work and you need to get that right, you need to spend all the time, you need to get that right.

(00:43:03):
This reminds me of something else that when your early investors shared with me, Bill Trenchard from First-Round Capital. He talked about how speed was the thing that you just dialed up as a lever to 11. That's where you just, "We will make this the focus. Speed, speed, speed." I think maybe the lesson there is, you pick the thing that you think will most differentiate you, make you significantly better than what's out there. So just thoughts on how you decided speed was the thing you were going to obsess with, and advice for folks that are trying to decide where to dial up things to 11?

Rahul Vohra (00:43:37):
Bill is right and I agree with him, you have to pick something. Knowing what to pick is the trick. In the early days of Superhuman, I read a book on positioning that really influenced my thinking. It is, I believe called Positioning the Battle for Your Mind. It struck me how the most well-known brands have stood for one clear thing, they have a clear position. So in order for Superhuman to be memorable, I believed that we needed to occupy a clear position that was unique and which was available and which reinforced our product strategy.

(00:44:12):
In the first year of Superhuman, therefore, I interviewed hundreds of potential customers about their experience with Gmail and with Outlook. And predictably, almost everybody says that email takes way too much time. But interestingly, many people also said that Gmail and Outlook were way too slow. That was how I first thought that speed could be an interesting position for us. I then asked myself, "Is the position of speed unique and is it available?" And the answer was overwhelmingly yes, because almost no software was being sold or has ever been sold on the value proposition of speed. The last time I could remember anyone trying to do this, was when Google launched Chrome, and obviously that went incredibly well for them. You may remember they had slow-motion videos where they were comparing Chrome render webpages and showing that was faster than an actual strike of lightning. No one had done it since then.

(00:45:15):
I then asked, "Well, does speed reinforce our product strategy?" And again, the answer was overwhelmingly yes. I knew that our competition was not going to be startups, it was incumbents. And I also knew that incumbents generally struggle with speed, because by definition they have massive scale and usually entrenched architecture. Then finally I did what I call the cocktail party test, which is to look at the cocktail parties and to watch how people pitch your product to other people. In our case the pitches were simple. People would say, "Dude, you have to use it, it's really fucking fast." And that's it. That was the pitch. That's how I knew that speed would be a really great position for us to start with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:08):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:24):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema of FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:47):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. Not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:59):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:19):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's one OneSchema.co.

(00:47:33):
The next area I want to spend time on and I imagine we'll have much insight is, some of the contrarian ways you approach building Superhuman that a lot of companies never thought about doing that you did that worked out for you. So the first is manually onboarding every single new user. Sure, startups have done this, founders bring on some folks and then cool, show it to them and then they stop doing that and then it's self-service or sales teams. How far did you scale this manual onboarding phase of your company? How many people did you have onboarding people, how many people did you manually onboard?

# The rituals of great teams | Shishir Mehrotra, Coda, YouTube, Microsoft

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I generally value the reference check over interview signals. If I had to stack rank in interviews, what is the best signal? The reference check is the top of the list. Those people, they worked with this person sometimes for years, their knowledge, what you're going to get out of 30 minutes of artificial scenarios it's just like never going to compare what a good reference check will give you.

(00:00:25):
Shishir Mehrotra is the co-founder and CEO of Coda. Before starting Coda Shishir led the YouTube product engineering and design teams at Google, where he spent over six years. Before that, he spent six years at Microsoft. He's also on the board of Spotify. As you'll hear in this episode, Shishir is an incredibly deep and very first principles thinker on all kinds of topics. And in this episode we cover growth strategy, specifically a framework that he calls Blue Loops and Black Loops.

(00:00:51):
We talk about the rituals of great teams, something that Shishir has been passionate about and has been collecting from all of the best leaders in tech for the past two years, and which will soon turn into a book. We talk about Eigenquestions, which is not a German game show. He shares how he evaluates product talent and gives some really great advice on doing reference checks. We go into so many other topics, this is the longest episode that I've recorded yet, and you'll see why. Shishir is so full of wisdom and we could have kept going for at least another hour. And so with that, I bring you Shishir Mehrotra. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey (00:01:29):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. So they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode on so many more things. Coda is giving listeners this podcast, $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny. Hey Ashley, head of marketing and flat file. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:02:38):
At least 40%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:02:43):
Well based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:03:17):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:03:48):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:49):
I don't think I've actually shared this with you, but you're actually the very first CEO that I've had on this podcast. I actually have a rule of no founders or CEOs on the podcast, at least at this point. And you're the first person that I've let break this rule. And so how does that feel?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:04:04):
I've always been a rule breaker.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:08):
Perfect. So bio for listeners just briefly. So you're the founder and CEO of Coda. You spend six years at Google where you're a VP of product and engineering for YouTube, basically leading the YouTube product team. Spent six years at Microsoft, you're on Spotify as board of directors, you're also a prolific online writer. And that leads to my first question, which is I hear that at Coda there's a contest internally for people who actually... So maybe a little context, you encourage people to write a lot of stuff externally within Coda. You want people to be writing and you have this contest of who gets the most views and likes of people internally. And so is that true and who's winning?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:04:47):
By the way, yes, it's true. We did a similar thing at YouTube and YouTube creators. I mean obviously kicked our butts, but we made a good way to make sure we understood our tools and learned how it worked. And I think for a while at YouTube I had one of the top videos, it was a really cute video of my daughter taking everybody's orders when she was like three or four years old.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:11):
That's not fair.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:05:12):
Yeah, super cute kid is an easy trick for YouTube, but I get to learn all the tools and so on here, the equivalent at Coda is you can publish Coda Docs, they show up in the gallery coda.com/gallery, you can see lots of them. And at this point, thousands of docs when published from lots of different people, it gets millions of views. And like at YouTube, the most popular ones are not ours, but it is sometimes helpful for us to make sure that we understand how the whole system works in order to do it. So I think that the current winning doc at Coda is one in a pretty deep niche. It's from a guy named Kenny Wong on our data team, and it's an orange theory workout doc. So it turns that orange theory has this deep subculture that they all hang out together on Reddit and so on. And this doc just took off as... I don't really understand the doc, I'm not in that subculture, but it's similar to YouTube in some ways. It's like the niches are actually much bigger than people think.

(00:06:17):
Of the ones that are more work related, I think Lane Stock on two-way writeup still outranks all of mine, but I have a couple of good ones on there too. And I would say this competition exists in my family too. I don't usually even win with that in my own family, my older daughter, Annika, who also had that great video on YouTube has two docs that do really well. One is Family Quarantine Olympics, which is a thing she put together at the beginning of COVID, like a fun game for families to play. And the other one is a score tracker for a game called Ticket to Ride, which I don't know if you've ever played the game, but it's...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
Heard of it.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:06:51):
It's about the most complicated scoring system on the planet because you play the whole game and you spend 10 minutes scoring it. And she built this whole scoring calculator and that turns out to be super popular too. Anyway, but my docs do okay. But yeah, the interesting variety of what people end up doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:07):
I love that. Which of your docs has been the most successful? Hopefully we end up talking about it.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:12):
I think it goes back and forth between two docs I've written one called Eigenquestions, which I think you intend to talk about, so we will get back to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:20):
Yeah, absolutely.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:21):
And the other one is one I wrote a while back called Four Mitzvot Bundling. That's all about how subscriptions work and it's how I ended up on the board of Spotify with Daniel and I geeking out on bundling theory, which is a super weird hobby, but I have normal hobbies too. But I liked it. I like to explore bundling as a fun hobby and people enjoy that doc as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:41):
Yeah, you've shared a lot of good thoughts on that and we're not going to cover that because covered that in depth in many places. But just to clarify, did you write that doc and then led you to being on the board of Spotify or is that after the fact?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:52):
The conversation led to... It was a napkin sketch at YouTube that turned into a really fun lunch I had with Daniel, Daniel at the Spotify founder and CEO. And then he encouraged me to write it down. And for me, you write prolifically and writing for me is actually surprisingly hard. I feel like I have to think about it.

(00:08:22):
You make it seem really easy. For me he's like, "Could you write that down?" It's like, "Great. Now I'm going to take a year to write this thing down." Because you think through each part of it and you kind of come up with the right framing. I have a little review process I use for my docs that allows other people to help me make it better, which is always really helpful. But yeah, so that's how that started. So it got written down after. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:47):
So we were talking about writing and content and things like that, and that's a really good segue to the first thing I wanted to talk about, which is Black Loops and Blue Loops, which to folks that haven't heard this before might sound like some ultimate fighting nightmare scenario, but it's something that is really important to you and Coda. And so to set it up, can you just talk about what Black Loops and Blue Loops are?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:09:08):
Yeah, and it's probably worth mentioning. I think a lot of businesses have a diagram that describes their ecosystem and how it works. Sometimes it happens a little later in a company's journey. For us, we're probably three or four years in before Matt Hudson's runs our data finance teams here. He came up with this diagram and it really stuck for people. But I highly encourage drawing a diagram like this for your business. I'll flash it up on screen for a second and I'll describe it, but this is what the diagram looks like, black loop, blue loop, and it's basically the two different ways that our product spreads. The Black Loop is someone comes in, they make a doc, they share with a group of people, some subset of the people turn around and make another doc, and the process repeats itself over and over again.

(00:09:53):
The blue loop is someone comes in, makes a doc, and instead of sharing it with a team or with the collaborators, they publish it to the world. And in that process expose it to, they can choose how it should appear. What publishing in Coda is a lot like building a website. So you pick a URL, you tell us whether or not Google should be able to find it show up in the gallery and so on. And what ends up happening from that is they turn into broad promotion of Coda, but really it's about that person what they're trying to get done. And I'll stop sharing so I can talk a little about the dynamics. So I sometimes refer to them as the Microsoft Loop and the YouTube Loop because those are two inspirations for it. The Black Loop feels a lot like how documents naturally spread.

(00:10:36):
The viral actions of a document platform are shared, create, share, create. It happens over and over and over again. The best way you learn about Office or Google Docs or so on is somebody shares one with you and you're like, "Oh, that's pretty cool. I bet I could create one." And that loop can happen very, very quickly and it really drives for us a lot of how we think about how we work mostly within companies and teams, but sometimes across them as well. And so for an example, it led to our pricing model. So our pricing model is a little different than most companies in the space that we do a thing called Maker Billing. So basically all document products, all products with the document metaphor have three personas, people who can see things, people who can change things, and people who can create new things.

(00:11:18):
Basically everybody charges for the top two. They charge for editors and makers. If you can make changes then you have to pay. And that's like every document product you can think of, including ones do drawing or so on. They all do the same thing. And we decided that we're only going to chart for people when they make a document. So you think about it, you get a Coda doc, you only need one If you are using any of our paid features, you only need one paid license for doing it. And the reason we do that in terms of that diagram is I wanted no friction on the share edge. I mean the share edge for us is like that's the moment of, "Hey look, I'm doing this thing, it's so cool." And that's the moment where the line I gave to the team is I want no dollar signs in the share dial going into that, every product has its moment of how he's for growth.

(00:12:04):
And going back to YouTube, imagine you had to pay for people you shared with. Nobody would ever share anything. But that's how basically every productivity product works is the moment they charge you is when you share with somebody. The Blue Loop, I often call the YouTube loop because the emotions of publishing a doc are incredibly close to that of publishing a YouTube video. And people have all sorts of reasons why they do it. I mean sometimes people do it, there are people who do it for money, but a lot of people do it for exposure, for brand building. They just want to get an idea out in the world. They want to get feedback. Some people do it for fun, some people do it as a charitable contribution. There's lots of reasons why people do it, but the net effect of what happens is for YouTube, the vast majority of how people found out about YouTube was through a video that was shared with them.

(00:12:51):
That's sort of the impact, but it changes the dynamic that allows everyone who publishes a Coda doc, now it's a very natural incentive to go share it with the right population. If you're an orange theory, you share it with the orange theory population. If you're into plane ticket to ride, you share it with the ticket to ride population. But if you're into bundling, you try to find a small group of people that care about bundling, tell them all about that. And what happens for us is that then becomes a loop. That means that most people's exposure and almost a third of our users come through this loop. They're not actually exposed to Coda, they're exposed to a great idea for how to run an offsite or how to win ticket to ride or whatever it might be. And in that process, they learn about the product. And so then they come in through this vehicle.

(00:13:45):
And one reason it's very important is because for products like ours that are very horizontal, you get different types of users. There's some users that I call the building block thinkers, they like to build up from scratch and the blank surface of Coda is really amazing for them, but for most people that's intimidating. I don't really know what to do. Most people in the world are problem solvers. And so they start not by, "Do I need a new document?" They start with, "I've got a problem, we don't make decisions fast enough at our company," or, "My family can't figure out what to do on the weekend," or whatever it might be. And then when they find a solution to that problem, they then pick the right tool. And so the blue Loop allows us to go after that and it changes how the motion of the ecosystem works as well. But that's what Blue Loop and Blue Loop is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:31):
Awesome. I have a bunch of questions I want to ask. The first is for founder listening to this and they're like, "Oh man, what am I loops? What's my flywheel? How do I think about my business?" Can you talk a bit about how you came upon this way of thinking about the company? And then also how do you structure your teams to work in this way if this is the way you're thinking about growth?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:14:50):
Maybe on the first part, and I think you just hosted Casey Winters, he is pretty famous for talking about loops, not funnels. And I do think there's a very natural thing when you're building a product or building a business to think about your funnel and you think about things as being linear, that somebody comes in, they go up to your signup process and then they see your onboarding and then they get exposed to the first magic moment in your product and the second magic moment, so on.

(00:15:13):
But the truth is, it doesn't really work that way. Almost all products have some form of loop. That person turns around and maybe sharing is built right in your product or maybe it's not, or maybe there's a way that it happens through advocacy, but understanding that the way products actually grow and spread happen through some type of loop not funnel, is I think pretty fundamental. So first piece of advice I'd give is you probably do have a loop. Whatever the product is, there's probably something about it that causes that loop and understanding how that works really important. I mean in terms of what it is. In our case, I'd say if you take Black Loop and Blue Loop, the Black Loop is every product in our category has that. We didn't invent it. You build a document, you put a share button on it, every product has that.

(00:16:01):
Sometimes it's just recognizing what's there. It's not that interesting. The Blue Loop on the other hand, is not something that every product in our category has. It's not really a thing that you expect to do with Google Docs or Office or so on. It's our unique take on, "Hey, we're going to build a publishing platform that isn't just for sharing ideas and building things with your team, therefore putting things out in the world." I mean, one of the best compliments we hear about the Coda Gallery is I had this user tell me, this line I really love is said that the Coda Gallery feels halfway between Medium and an app store. And you can come and you can read about anything interesting in the world and you can go shopping and say, "I need one of those. I need one of those and I need one of those."

(00:16:40):
And it's my view that this category, we call the all-in-one doc category, I think this is going to be critical. I don't think that there's enough people out there that are looking for a horizontal new blinking cursor. I mean, they exist and you can get through your first million users that way. But I think to get to the level of impact we want to have, we've got to find this problem, see here. So you probably have a loop, not a funnel, and it might be hiding in plain sight or it might require invention. That's the bounder dance and the fun of it, but finding it, writing it down I think is really helpful. Second part... Oh, how do we organize team?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:18):
Yeah, but let me ask one quick question. You said this, I think it was a data scientist that first imagined and diagram this out because I'm curious, as a founder listening, they're like, "Oh, how do I find something like this?" I imagined part of this was, "Oh, this person brought you this interesting way of thinking." And there's this process of, "Oh wow, this is cool. Let's think about this." What was that like? Just over high level, that process.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:17:41):
He currently runs data and finance for us. He's actually one of the early founding members of the team, Matt Hudson. So he is getting every job here around the go to market team. Very insightful. But honestly, the idea can come from anywhere. I mean there's a really famous loop diagram for Uber that I think one of the board members drew it or Travis drew it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):
Built early.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:18:01):
Yeah, right. Yeah, that napkin sketch, who knows how true that is. Probably lots of dispute on that. I think Airbnb had a similar diagram. I'm trying to remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):
We tried, we had some sketches.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:18:15):
Right. So it can come from anywhere. I do find that the most natural place to see it is just when you're talking about your business to someone, when you're pitching a customer or a candidate, I actually think candidate... I think we're going to talk a little bit about energy, but I think talking to candidates is one of the best ways to hone what your business is about. Because those people are in some ways even more critical than investors. I mean they're investing their time, not just their money. And so your ability to get across to them why this thing is going to be interesting and how it'll grow.

(00:18:50):
And they're the most discerning investors out there in a lot of ways. And they're actually not that easily confused by metrics and so on that could be temporary. And they put themselves in that picture like, "Can I see that happening?" And so for us, the black loop part is pretty obvious, but the blue loop part, you had to squint a little bit to think, "Will people really do that? Will people come and publish these documents like some hybrid between websites and blog posts and templates? What are they going to going to do and why?" And so it required a little bit of creativity, which forced me to get better and better at pitching why that's going to happen and what that role is going to feel like. And this analogy of halfway between Medium and an app store is that helped people crystallize what that promise has to feel like. So I think that... And this idea can come from anywhere, but if you want mine for your own loops, go look at what you told the last few candidates you talked to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:48):
I like that. And then just take some attempts at drawing some kind of diagrams. That's how I thought about that when I was thinking about it. Do you find that the quality of user is different amongst the loops? I imagine one is like 80% of the growth, but maybe the other is a different type of user, maybe higher quality. I think about a little bit with Airbnb referrals drove higher quality hosts, even though it was still a small portion of all hosts. And so it was a really lucrative and interesting channel. Do you find anything like that?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:20:14):
So I mean quality and activation are a little bit different. I mean the Blue Loop definitely, there's actually three entry points on that diagram. Those people come through the Blue Loop, those people get shared through the Black Loop and those people come through the top of the funnel. There has to be like your seat population, somebody starts with blinking cursor. Nobody shared anything with them. Either a Blue Loop, a template to document or Black Loop a way the team is running. If you look at activation, retention, so on, certainly the highest is the black share. Somebody shares the document and says, "Hey, this is how we're running the staff meeting." You're just going to use it. So the job or retention there is a all different, and actually one thing that is... Actually, let me come back to that evolution. Second best is through the blue loop and then the third, the worst, the hardest is activating through the very top. And from there, roughly one in five people make it to what we think of as our activation moment, which is hard.

(00:21:14):
It's like you're going to hand somebody a new product that they didn't start with a problem on and nobody handed them a document to say, "Just work in." That's hard now. Now all our flows are really important and so on. But if you think about these three different dynamics from how you asked about how you struck your team, they're incredibly different mindsets. Because coming to the top of that diagram, we get to own the conversation. We have our opportunity to tell you what the product's about, what you should do with it, here's the minimal set of things you need to know in order to be productive and gradually reveal the other things that you might need to know, meaning the order of those things wrong, real trouble. But it's actually a minority of how people get exposed to Coda because in the black loop, the person who owns that conversation, the person sharing the document with you. If that person does it and mispositions it or doesn't just makes a crappy document or so we have to help them onboard their users, which become our users.

(00:22:11):
Same thing in the Blue Loop, that conversation is now owned by the publisher. They're really not that interested in teaching anybody about Coda. They're mostly interested in here's this really cool way to do Orange Theory, or here's this interesting way to run a meeting. And so, one of the interesting things about building platforms, which I think is a little bit different than products that get to be direct. For better or worse, most of the products I've gotten to work on are platform products. And I find that there's two very different kinds of people that like that challenge. So some people, and I think Steve Jobs was the quintessential example, if he didn't really like being a platform, the iPhone ship without an app store, they locked down the screws on the back on all the devices that nobody could open them. And his viewpoint was, " I'm going to control every element of what my users see." And on...

Shishir Mehrotra (00:23:00):
I'm going to control every element of what my users see. And on the other hand, platform thinkers, you sort of assume that my connection to my eventual user is through someone else. Like YouTube, regularly they come to work at YouTube and somebody would say, "Well, here's what happened last night." And sometimes it's heartwarming, like, oh, my gosh, this kid bit this other kid's finger and it took off like crazy and this Korean pop star just broke through the billion view mark before everybody else did. And sometimes it was not heartwarming and you don't get to control that because that's part of being a platform.

(00:23:37):
And so it does change how you think about the way you run the team because if you have a loop where your community ecosystem users on control that narrative, then you have to incorporate that. Another close analogy I think is Airbnb and the famous story of them taking pictures of people's apartments. It's like they had to reach out and try to control that and eventually you can't do that. You had to sit back and let people market their hotels. And thankfully the ecosystem got good at it, but they kind of had a similar dynamic, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):
Absolutely. With Airbnb, pricing is even more of a challenge where a lot of hosts don't really know what to price. They think their place is worth a lot more and we can't tell them the price. There's laws around that. And so it's like, hey, maybe you want to price it at this rate if you know what's good for you. So it's a lot of encouraging. So yeah, I've seen that in action. So you talked about teams and how you think about structuring them a bit and that's a good segue to our second topic, which is around a book that I hear you're writing called The Rituals of Great Teams.

(00:24:40):
And I think what you're doing there is exploring rituals that have emerged at some of the more successful companies. And so just a question there, one, how'd you get interested in rituals, so much so that you decided to write a book, which is such a trudge and endless amount of work? And just yeah, where is it at, how's it going? And then I'll ask you a few more questions there.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:24:59):
The writing a book, so I'm writing this book, it's called Rituals of Great Teams. And when I signed up to do it, I thought it was going to take six months. I'm now almost two years in [inaudible 00:25:11] my manuscript in four months and I am probably half done. So there's a lot of work ahead of us in building, but it's one of the most fun projects I've ever done. So the history behind this was, as in many cases, is a lot of sort of odd luck and happenstance. I got hosted right at the start of the pandemic. I was interviewed for a different podcast called Masters of Scale by Reid Hoffman. And the way Reid records, which I'm not sure I would recommend this, but he does it a little bit differently than you do. You sit down with no idea what you're going to talk about and you talk for three hours.

(00:25:49):
And then he has a group of editors, the same group that actually at its head, and they come in and they pick 20 minutes of it and they turn and one episode. And you have no idea what it's going to be, so you talk and talk and talk and gets 20 minutes out and they're pretty good at getting to a nugget. So they picked out of this whole discussion this part that I thought was really small and it was Reid had asked me for one of my favorite quotes and I talked about this quote from a guy named Bing Gordon. People don't know Bing. Bing was one of the founders of Electronic Arts. He's a famous investor, Amazon, Zynga, so owns lots of great companies. And I happened to sit on a board with Bing and he used this line. I think Bing's one of the best non-linear thinkers in The Valley. Always learned something with Bing.

(00:26:29):
And he used this line that really stuck with me. He said great companies has a very small list of golden rituals. And there are three rules of golden rituals. Number one, they're named. Number two, every employee knows them by their first Friday and, number three, they're templated. And he has great examples. Amazon has six pagers and Google has OKRs and Salesforce has V2MOM and there's all these different rituals that people do. And I ended up sharing on the podcast a little bit about what Coda's golden ritual is. If you were to ask a set of Coda employees on their first Friday what Coda's golden ritual is, they would almost certainly tell you about this thing we do called Dory/Pulse. It's sort of the key of how we run meetings and do write-ups and so on. It's a pretty simple idea, is that in our write-ups and in our meetings, instead of going around the room and hearing what everybody thinks, we do this thing called Pulse.

(00:27:26):
Everybody writes down what they think and we hide everybody else's until you're done writing. So you force yourself to be eloquent about your opinion, on the record about it, and unbiased. And then the second thing we do is called Dory, which is instead of randomly asking questions, we ask people to put the questions on the table and then we take a round of up quoting and down voting them to actually figure out what we're going to talk about. Dory's named after the fish who asks all the questions. It's a tool we use a lot at Google that we kind of turned into this mini tool. If you were to ask a set of Coda employees on the first Friday about Coda's golden rituals with Bing's three tests, they'll certainly talk about Dory and Pulse. And it's not because they're meeting wonks. It's because it's indicative of the culture of the team.

(00:28:08):
And so I'll regularly hear employees say things like, "I just joined Coda. It's been a week. It's amazing. The culture is so open that I got to ask a question in a meeting and it outvoted the CEOs." Or they'll say, "I got asked for my contribution to this really hard decision we're making and it was thoughtfully presented. I had space to be able to do it well without bias and it was actually read and considered as part of the decision making process." Reid's podcast did pretty well and I got all these questions about rituals and so I decided to do a dinner which turned into a dinner series. And basically every third Wednesday we would host a group of people to share the rituals with each other. And I learned a bunch of stuff in this process.

(00:28:54):
I've now interviewed over 1,000 people for this book and There's lots of really interesting rituals that come out of it, but first thing I learned is people love sharing their rituals. I've interviewed people from many companies that everybody's heard of, Nike, Disney, New York Times. It's all the way down to many startups that maybe people haven't heard of or companies in industries that people don't talk a lot about. Book authors, pundits, lots of different people that have come through this process. Everybody loves sharing their rituals. Everybody has little secrets to how they run their business, but for some reason the how we work part everybody's very willing to share. People also love hearing about them. And I was like, "Is this going to be interesting for a dinner, geeking out about how a team works?" And it turns out not only do people like hearing about it, it's the littlest details that matter. It's like, yeah, we kind of do that, too, but we have this issue.

(00:29:46):
How'd you get past this? And you start discovering that actually those little details are what would make or break a thing, that you can't quite do it the exact same way. And then the other thing I realized, which is probably the most important point, is that rituals are, I like to say that they are, a mirror of culture. That one of the attendees, Dharmesh Shah, founder of HubSpot and very thoughtful person, he talked a lot about this thing that is virtually presented as something called flash tags, which is a really cool example. But Dharmesh talked about how when we're building companies, we actually build two products. We build one for our customers and we build another one for our employees. That's actually how we work part of it. That's the term he uses for that, is culture. That's the product we build for our employees.

(00:30:29):
I think it's a very interesting way to define what culture is. Interestingly, when you ask people about their culture, hey, what's the culture of Google, or Airbnb, or so on, the way they'll answer the question is through rituals. They'll say here's what we do and the way you know this is what we do is through this ritual that's in place. So I thought that was pretty interesting. Started off just building a little listicle of here's all the great rituals and then I started realizing that actually the comparison between them is kind of interesting. And so I started sort of filling in the gaps between them of like when would you do X versus Y and what did I learn through that process? Publisher asked if I would turn it into a book and I agreed without really contemplating how hard it would be. And it's become what most of my evenings end up being on this.

(00:31:17):
I have a wonderful co-writer, Erin Dame, who's incredibly gracious with her time and helping me sort through the best ideas and the worst ideas, but it's a really fun project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:29):
What are some of the more wacky and/or impactful rituals that you've come across that you can share?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:31:36):
Boy. I'd sort it down the list. I'll tell you some that are interesting and recognizable. One of the most fun ones is from Arianna Huffington and she shared a ritual called Reset. And there's a bit of background on Arianna, she's well known for Huffington Post. She now runs Thrive. She had an accident a few years back and ended up going through a period of doing a lot of research on how the brain works and ended up coming to this set of conclusions about how you can affect your own brain chemistry. And one of the things she does as a sort of personal ritual is I think called a reset.

(00:32:13):
It's basically the ritual is you make a one minute video that is personal. And they have a little template for doing it, but it's a breathing exercise. It's like you are supposed to play it while you do this breathing exercise, but it's personal. So it's like her video, you go search YouTube for Arianna's reset, you'll find it. It has pictures of her kids, it has quotes she loves, it has videos of her hometown in Greece and so on, but the way she brought it to the team was they start meetings by randomly picking someone. They call it spin the wheel. They randomly pick someone and they play their reset. And the idea is you get this two for one where everybody gets a little bit the brain chemistry rewiring of 60 second breathing exercise. Everybody gets back into that sort of zen state a little bit and you learn a little bit about each other.

(00:33:05):
And she was saying that the pictures people pick and so are interesting, but actually the music people pick is probably the most interesting. A lot of people pick calm music, some people will pick something they rock out to, but everybody does their reset a little bit differently. So that was a really fun one. Another really fun one that I was surprised by, Gusto does this thing in their hiring calls. So you get an offer from Gusto and apparently when you get on the offer call of congratulations, you got an offer, instead of just meeting the recruiter, which is what most companies do, they have the entire group of people that interviewed you join the call and they all say something about why you're amazing and you should join Gusto.

(00:33:46):
And it's such an interesting ritual in so many ways. For the candidate, obviously what an amazing experience. To use an Airbnb term, that's like a level 11 experience of what that feels like, but also for the company. One of the questions I get asked, "What if I voted no? What if I'd said this person is a no hire?" And I said, "It doesn't matter. You're on the call, you're going to work with this person, you're going to help them feel welcome and you're going to help them understand where they stand." I think it obviously takes a bunch of time, but it also is a signal to the company of how important hiring is and something that obviously we all prioritize. Those are maybe a couple of the maybe different ones that people might not have heard of before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
Those are amazing examples. Have you integrated any of these rituals from other companies doing this research into Coda?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:34:37):
All the time and it's the cheapest form of research. I mean, I get to borrow all these great ideas from all these companies. We just added one to our decision making process. This is a good example of a little detail that really matters, is Coinbase has a ritual that's formed around ... This is a decision-making ritual they call ... It's actually amazing how many companies have a decision-making ritual with a name, with a bur. So at Square, Vocal called them Spades. He kind of verbified it. There's a template, but you use Bing's three tenants. It's got to be named, every employee knows it by the first Friday and it's templated.

(00:35:18):
So Coinbase does a thing they call rapids and rapid is a framing around what the roles in it are, the responsible approver, participating, informed and decider, but their technique of doing it was really interesting. They have this subtle nudge thing that we weren't doing that I've now incorporated at Coda. So at Coda we have Dory and Pulse, like a very common ritual. It spread through a lot of different companies that use Coda. You don't really have to use Coda to do it, but I think Coda is pretty good at it. But one of the things we were facing was that you would do this pulse and so you'd have a meeting. And if you did it wrong, it could feel like voting and it could feel like consensus building.

(00:36:04):
And so we would get this, people would talk about it and every ritual has its pro and con, but people would look at it and say very open culture, you're allowed to share whatever you want. But on the other side for the person that's trying to make a decision, it can feel like, oh, my God, I now have 30 pieces of feedback. Am I supposed to wait for all 30 of them to be yes? Am I supposed to wait for it to be a majority and how do I know? What am I supposed to do here? And so Coinbase had this really simple idea that we sort of smushed together, which was at the top of their rapids they named who all the people were and then next to each one they put a little box that said what is the decision from that person?

(00:36:44):
They just organized. It's very similar to Pulse, but they kind of organized them and said everybody that's in the inform bucket, they can comment, that's totally fine, but we really care about the approvers, the responsible and then of course the decider, the one that really matters. And so we just added a column to our Pulse, which is what is the role? And we grouped the table by that. And the other thing that Coinbase does, which it sounds really subtle and small, but really in detail it really matters, is the person running the meeting pre-fills that with what they want from that person. You are an approver. Maybe I have three approvers because I have a budget approver and I have a marketing approver and I have a sales approver, whatever it might be, and I need you to give me this answer. I don't need you to comment on everything I'm doing, but I need you to tell me do we have the budget or not?

(00:37:31):
Or I need you to tell me am I authorized to make this change in this part of the product that we generally don't change, or can I change the onboarding flow, or whatever it might be? And we took a process that I think was doing a pretty good job of getting rid of groupthink, which is really the heart of what we were doing with Pulse, but had this danger of being overly leaning towards consensus building to a fault. I think consensus building is a good thing, but consensus building to a fault is not. And we sort of stole this one from Coinbase and we switched it in and it got better. And that's a good example very recently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:05):
I feel like you have a clear bestseller on your hands here and I can't wait to read this. I almost feel like you have an unfair advantage right now having all these insights before you share them, being able to execute so much more efficiently.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:38:17):
Well, yeah, it's interesting. I'm obviously not trying to keep any of it a secret, so the whole point of publishing it is because I think other people will enjoy it and can get benefit out of it. But if people are interested, one of the other choices I made in writing this book is I decided to do it somewhat in the open. So there's what I call the rituals of great teams brain trust. And so if you just search for me and Rituals of Great Teams, you'll find it. And I'm sure we can add the link to the show notes, but you can sign up. And basically, as I finish a chapter, I put it out to the group and there's now a few hundred people that are helping me co-edit this thing.

(00:38:55):
Some of them just because some of them come in and give me help on storytelling, grammar, so on, but a lot of them are contributing where they show up and they say, "Hey, you missed this one. We actually do that, but we do this other thing a little bit differently and you should really talk about that." Because I kind of view it as it started as a dinner series. It started with everybody's going to give to each other. And so I kind of wanted to bring that into the writing process. It's also a cheap way to get some pretty good editors and it pretty helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
I love that. That is really smart. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:40:14):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:40:36):
And How have you found these rituals form for someone that's listening and are like, "We need some rituals, we need to move more effectively." How do these come up? Are they just organically organized? Do they come in from other and they evolve? Is it founder driven? What have you found so far? I know you're still working on the book, but curious.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:40:53):
There's a whole section of the book on ... I get this question a lot of how do I find the rituals we have? How do I adjust the rituals to match? Are they supposed to change? There's lots of things you see because some rituals are great when you're 100 people and they're terrible when you're 1,000. And you should actively change those things. Some are great in what sometimes people call peacetime versus wartime. You should do this during this time, but you should actively not do it when you're in this other time. And actually, that in itself is a ritual. I mean, every company has some form of a war room ritual that is ... I guess Facebook I was learning. We did a dinner last night, so I learned a little bit about it. Facebook apparently calls them lockdowns, which is a term I hadn't heard before, but apparently it's well understood. When they say lockdown, everybody knows exactly what it means.

(00:41:37):
It's like we no longer do the goal setting process, you drop this type of work and everybody just knows this is what it means. But I would say that when we talk to people about rituals, a set of rituals that happen organically. I mean, those are the easiest. Dory and Pulse for us was one of the product managers running a meeting just thought it was we're a distributed first culture, but hadn't really adapted to it properly. And this product manager is just annoyed at waiting around on Zoom for everybody to go around and say their piece and it just took forever. And by the end everybody's like, "Can we just pause? Everybody just write down what you think." And he just happened to do it in this thoughtful way and it just took off. And so some rituals grow organically and you just got to wait for them to do it.

(00:42:24):
But there are cases where companies actively form a ritual to drive a certain behavior. And the best advice I've given on this topic is to read one of my other favorite books. It's a book called Switch. It's by Chip and Dan Heath. All their books are amazing, but they also wrote Decisive and Made to Stick and Moments and so on. But this one is, if I could recommend five books, this would take two slots on the list. And the subtitle of the book is How to Change Things When Change is Hard. And the basic idea of the book is they use this analogy of a writer on an elephant on a path. And when you're trying to change things, you have three options for what you can do and it actually kind of maps to Bing's analogy. So you can direct the writer, so you can tell people what to do.

(00:43:13):
You can motivate the elephant, so you can give this thing a kick in the butt and it's going to move. You don't know exactly where it's going to move, but it's going to move. And you can shape the path. Shape the path is I'm going to set this way up so that you can only do these things. The way I think about it is direct the writer, tell people what to do. That's why if you look at Bing's tests, that's why you teach employees this before the first writing. You tell people this is what we do. And so some rituals, how do you get this ritual to work? You put it in your new hire onboarding and you make it work that way. Motivate the elephant, a lot of that's about branding. So what do you do with rituals? It's an amazing number of rituals where I'll tell people that seems like a great ritual.

(00:43:51):
I would highly encourage you to give it a name. Give it something that lets people anchor ideas to. Names a very powerful thing. If I said, "Yeah, at Coda we do voting and sentiment writing or something," I don't even know what you would say. It would sound boring. It wouldn't sound like something you could brag about, something you could form identity around. And so it's very important to give it a name. And then finally, why do you shape the path or you set things up? You templatize, make it as easy as possible to follow this ritual. And make it just a part of what we do enough, then if you're at Gusto and you're like, "I don't really understand that hiring cult thing," where it's like guess what? You're going to be invited to one soon.

(00:44:28):
You're going to see it and then you're going to have to do it. Or if you're at Square, you're going to see the spade template and you're going to learn how to do it. So I think Switch is ... I recommend this book for lots of purposes, but as you're thinking about rituals for your teams, it's a particularly relevant frame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:45):
Awesome. By the way, that's a little plug for the YouTube version of this podcast, which is now a thing we do. So if you're like, hey, I don't see what you're talking about, just search for Lenny's podcast, YouTube, and I think you'll find it and we'll probably link to the ad in the show notes. I'm also reminded of Airbnb's rituals, which you probably already know about, but they're kind of all hilarious and weird. One is formal Friday, where people dress up in suits and gowns on Fridays. Another is a human tunnel for all new employees, where every new employee has to run through a human tunnel and jump into a beanbag or something. And then there's a new hire tea time, where new hires drink some tea with some veterans and chat about where they're from and things like that. There's a bunch more, but those are the ones that are my favorite.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:45:27):
Those are great. I also included some of the level 11 thinking as well. I think that's also a good Chesky favorite. Brian also has another one that's in the book that's about how to rank your to-do list by finding leverage. That's a really fun one as well. They're like don't rank your to-do list, but a lot of people do importance versus urgency or so on. And I guess he sorts his by which of these is most likely to create leverage of getting rid of the rest of my lists, which I thought was very ... I started doing that in my to- do list and it's very interesting and impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:02):
That's actually an incredible segue ...

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:00):
... you listen, it's very interesting and impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:02):
That's actually an incredible segue to our next topic, which are eigenquestions.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:06):
Ah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
And so eigenquestions, one of your most classic posts, you mentioned this at the top, maybe your one of the most liked posts, other than maybe bundling. It sounds like some kind of German game show, eigenquestions. Can you tell us what eigenquestions are, and then I'm going to ask you a few more questions around that?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:22):
I've thought about the German game question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):
Yeah, sorry [inaudible 00:46:27].

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:29):
I didn't know this would be a very interesting game, but we could try to create one. Okay, so I'll describe what eigenquestions are, but maybe I'll start by telling you a little bit about where the concept came from. And, this is actually a YouTube-ism that... Maybe just to place ourselves in history, so in 2008 I joined YouTube. And many people don't remember this, but YouTube at the time was seen as a mistake. It was seen as Google's first bad acquisition, everything else had worked, but this thing kind of seemed like a disaster. It was grainy videos, we were losing lots of money, we had billions of dollars in lawsuits, none of it really seemed that obvious. There's lots of discussion on how to reorient it, fix it, and so on. And so everybody outside, that's what they saw.

(00:47:14):
If you stepped inside a YouTube staff meeting in 2008, actually one of the toughest questions we were answering was this question we called the Modern Family question. And it may sound small, but it actually was very perplexing. And the question was pretty simple, the question was if you looked at our search traffic at YouTube, one of the top five queries basically every week was for a show called Modern Family. And Modern Family was number one show on television at the time, by far the most popular. And we were second-biggest search engine in the world behind our parent company Google, so search traffic was very important. There was one big problem, people would come search for Modern Family, one big problem, we didn't have Modern Family on YouTube. And so we'd give them some pretty crappy responses. And the question was... And by the way, ABC.com had decided to post every episode of Modern Family live on their website.

# Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups: Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more | Dalton Caldwell (YC)

## Transcript

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:00):
Seeing everything people apply to YC with. People all have the same idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):
One of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:07):
One of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have this concept of tarpit ideas.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:17):
Seems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
Recently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:28):
We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
A lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:36):
A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Are there other patterns you find across startups that do well?

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:43):
There's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.

(00:01:50):
Why every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Dalton Caldwell (00:04:45):
Yeah. Thanks so much, Lenny. I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
So to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?

Dalton Caldwell (00:05:22):
Have you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, "Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game." If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, "Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one." It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.

(00:06:33):
And so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?

Dalton Caldwell (00:07:14):
The way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?

(00:08:26):
And so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
What's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?

Dalton Caldwell (00:09:01):
I think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.

(00:09:51):
And again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, "Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time." Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Yeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, "Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?" Versus, "Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup." Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, "I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed"?

Dalton Caldwell (00:10:50):
If it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Yeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, "What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?

Dalton Caldwell (00:12:08):
That definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, "Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing." I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.

(00:13:13):
And then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
Wow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:14):
They thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, "We're going to build a new VR headset." And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
Wow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:45):
Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about." And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.

(00:15:41):
In the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, "I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it." Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):
These are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, "Oh, here's a big idea." And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...

Dalton Caldwell (00:16:38):
In the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, "We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better." And then they were like, "Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations." And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?

(00:17:30):
There was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.

Dalton Caldwell (00:17:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
A big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?

Dalton Caldwell (00:18:02):
Again, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, "Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something." When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-

Dalton Caldwell (00:19:18):
Yeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.

(00:20:29):
And they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
He did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.

Dalton Caldwell (00:20:54):
Yeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Also Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:14):
Of course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
I was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:41):
Yeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.

(00:22:37):
And so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.

(00:23:24):
A few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):
This is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?

Dalton Caldwell (00:24:10):
For people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.

(00:25:10):
If you ask your friends, "Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?" They're like, "Yeah, I would love that." You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, "Oh, we're going to fix music discovery." This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
Absolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, "How's it going?" And everyone when they used it, they're like, "Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to." And then they never use it again.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:19):
Do you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
Yeah.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:21):
Years?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
They told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:30):
Yeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
Along these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, "What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.

Dalton Caldwell (00:27:09):
Maybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, "Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no." And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. "I need feedback." That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.

(00:28:05):
And so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, "Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget." They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, "Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no." I don't think that's how this actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
I think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:00):
Yeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, "Yeah." If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Specifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:25):
I think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.

(00:30:34):
And again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
It makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-

Dalton Caldwell (00:30:57):
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):
I think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?

Dalton Caldwell (00:31:32):
Yeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, "Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky." You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, "Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to..." And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):
Fair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?

Dalton Caldwell (00:32:35):
I don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton." And then two years later they're like, "Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up." So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):
To make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. "Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google." And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, "Oh wow, everything went wrong." It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
How do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?

Dalton Caldwell (00:34:39):
I think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.

Dalton Caldwell (00:36:54):
Oh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):
I think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?

Dalton Caldwell (00:37:23):
I completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, "Yeah, we're failing." I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, "We got one more move in us. We got one more try." You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.

(00:38:17):
And so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, "Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore." And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, "I don't want to do this anymore." And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
That is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:16):
Yeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, "I'm done." If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
And you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:41):
I would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, "Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in." And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):
That is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, "Talk to customers. Build things they want." Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, "Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars." Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?

Dalton Caldwell (00:40:57):
Yeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool." And I'm like, "Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?" And they're like, "Well." And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.

(00:41:49):
And you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, "Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers." Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, "Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag."

(00:42:51):
The whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):
When someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:17):
Yeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):
That's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:51):
Yeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
Makes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
People just don't realize the wild journey that you have been on over the past 18 years building this company. It feels like there's almost been these three eras of Dropbox. The first era of you're killing it.

Drew Houston (00:00:10):
For the first several years, it was doubling, 10-xing every year. Taping user counts that we printed out to the wall, and then running out of space on the wall. Having to put 100,000 users, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000 on the ceiling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
And there's the second era, which I'll just say, everyone's trying to kill you.

Drew Houston (00:00:26):
We started getting all the incumbents. Apple, Microsoft, Google. All of them launched competing products, but weirdly, it was sort of like you see the videos where there's the mushroom cloud in the distance. You see it. But you don't hear, or notice it. It was also clear that winter was coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
It feels like the year 2015 was a pivotal year where things started to shift.

Drew Houston (00:00:45):
I'd start to hear a louder set of critics inside, and outside the company. Less than a year later, Google Photos launches. And not only does it provide a lot of the same value, but they also gave you free unlimited storage for life. And so, they just totally nuked our business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
You end up fighting wars on three or four fronts against the big kahunas that have infinite cash, and can do whatever they want.

Drew Houston (00:01:08):
So it killed Carousel, killed Mailbox, went all-in on productivity. And I wish I could say, "Then, everything got better." It was the opposite, actually. The narrative completely flipped on the company. Suddenly, your employees don't want to wear your T-shirt anymore. Everybody's looking to you, and is wondering, "How the hell did you get us in this situation?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):
Today, my guest is Drew Houston. This may be the most interesting, and most useful episode of my podcast so far. Especially if you're a founder, or if you someday want to be a founder.

Welcome to the podcast.

Drew Houston (00:04:51):
Oh, thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:53):
I have been so looking forward to this conversation for so many reasons. One, is I feel like people just don't realize the wild journey that you have been on over the past 18 years building this company. You told me a few of these stories when we had dinner recently, and I was just like, "You need to come on the podcast, and tell this stuff. I think it'll be really useful to a lot of people."

(00:05:12):
And then also, I feel like you're just a very real talk founder that isn't afraid to share what's really going on. I think a lot of founders don't actually tell you the things they're going through. It's always, "Killing it. We're killing it all the time." So for all those reasons, I'm really excited to have this chat, and this opportunity to stand with you and hear these stories. So thank you again for doing this.

Drew Houston (00:05:29):
Me too, and I've been a big fan of the podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
Oh.

Drew Houston (00:05:32):
I learned a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:33):
Oh, wow. I appreciate that. The way I'm thinking we structure this conversation is, as an outsider, it feels like there's almost been these three eras of Dropbox. And tell me if I am missing something, but essentially, it feels like there's the first era of you're killing it. Just up and to the right killing it. Dropbox is on fire.

(00:05:52):
And then, there's the second era that I think fewer people know about, which I'll just say, everyone was trying to kill you. All the incumbents are coming after you. I like that it leads you to sigh. This is going to be good. And then, there's the current era. I'll say the third era of just rethinking what Dropbox could be. Does that sound roughly right? That's a good way to think about that?

Drew Houston (00:06:11):
I think that's right. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:12):
Okay, awesome. So let's start with this first era, and spend some time here. Which is, I think, the era most people know you for. There's the big Hacker News launch, the demo video of the thumb drive you're always losing, the referral program everyone's always studying. You're almost the epitome of viral growth. And so, let's just talk about just things here that maybe people don't know about. Maybe some moments that are really important to you, memories that stand out to you. So maybe just start wherever you want to start about this time of the history of Dropbox.

Drew Houston (00:06:41):
I mean, I started Dropbox more out of just personal frustration, and it really felt like something that only I was super interested in as far as file syncing. And focusing on one customer, which is myself. And then there's the story of me forgetting my thumb drive on a trip to New York, and things like that, and coding. I won't get into all that. I had a lot of friends who were in Y Combinator, and many friends who had moved from Boston where I was living out to California. And doing that whole pilgrimage, or kind of maybe one-way pilgrimage.

(00:07:14):
And feeling a little bit left out, but then also having this idea for Dropbox. And then I think some of the most memorable things were the moments where Dropbox really felt like it was taking on a life of its own, or maybe it belonged to the internet, and not so much to me anymore. So for example, we had a lot of success with these demo videos. First, was just getting into Y Combinator. It sort of worked backwards from thinking about, "What does Paul Graham do all day?" And my hypothesis was that he just hits refresh on Hacker News like everyone else. Like me, like everyone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:46):
This was you trying to figure out how to get Paul Graham's attention?

Drew Houston (00:07:49):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):
I love that. "What does Paul Graham do all day?" Okay.

Drew Houston (00:07:52):
Yeah. Well, my first company was doing online SAT prep, and I was 21 when I started that. But in the world, there's a lot that Y Combinator has in common with college admissions. You have 1,000,000 people applying for very few spots. And the more you can get some kind of hook, or find some kind of side door. That was the thinking, and I was like, "All right. Well, if I can create some kind of viral video, put it on Hacker News, get Paul's attention, that'd be one way to do it."

(00:08:21):
And that was inspired by a book called Guerrilla Marketing that I had read, which is basically how to do marketing if you have no money. Which was a good fit for where we were. I say, "We." It was just me at the time. And sure enough, I made this video that was basically a pretty straightforward screencast of Dropbox. Showing it working on my computer, and then it hit the top of Hacker News for two days. I don't think it can really happen anymore, but sure enough, we got a note from Paul saying, "Hey, this is interesting, but you need a co-founder."

(00:08:56):
Which was a problem because it's clear that the YC application deadline for the next cycle was maybe a week or two away. So Paul was basically sending me a helpful note that, "I know you're not dating anyone, but you need to be married in the next two weeks if you want to get into YC." So I ended up finding my co-founder, Arash, and there's just story after story like that in the early days. So I'd say the first chapter was characterized by just feels like one moment I'm sort of paddling in the ocean alone on a little board. The next, I'm just like a hundred feet off the ground on this tidal wave trying to stay on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:32):
How long does this period last of just Hacker News to something starts to change? How long is this up and to the right period?

Drew Houston (00:09:40):
It was the first several years. So I started the company back in 2007. I might have been 24 at the time, moved to California. And so, I'd say it was first probably seven years from 2007 to 2014 were really that crazy fever dream .com experience where it's a blur. I mean, basically, get into Y Combinator. After we finish Y Combinator, that culminates in Demo Day, and getting your first investors. At Demo Day was this guy named Pejman Nozad who is an angel investor who also owned a rug store in Palo Alto. He runs Pear there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Oh, and he runs Pear. [inaudible 00:10:25].

Drew Houston (00:10:24):
Yeah, and he runs Pear now. He introduced us to Sequoia. He came with us to the pitch, which I learned later it was unusual. And that was on a Friday, and then Saturday Mike Moritz is in our apartment. But anyway, so we raised money from Sequoia, and that was a seed round in 2007. So right after we finished Y Combinator. And then, basically, you start with a pretty narrow circle of what you're working on.

(00:10:53):
I mean, right in the beginning it's just really just coding, and talking to customers. But that circle kept expanding pretty rapidly. So in 2007, we were just building the first prototype of the product. It was in closed beta for about a year. And in end of 2008, we launched at what's now TechCrunch Disrupt. Our demo totally failed. The wifi wasn't working on stage, so a live demo is quite underwhelming. So that took a few years off my life, but fortunately, we had accumulated this big beta waiting list from basically doing another version of that Hacker News video.

(00:11:33):
Engineered to be even more viral, and have all these memes, and things in it. But similarly, a few minute demo video of, "What's Dropbox? And here's moving stuff between a Windows PC, and a Mac. And here's all these little Easter eggs about the HD DVD encryption key, or [inaudible 00:11:50] who was one of the first YouTubers. Tom Cruise jumping on a couch in Scientology." This was a long time ago. 15 years ago, or something. But we put this video on Dig, and Reddit. And our beta waiting list went from 5,000 to 85,000 people overnight.

(00:12:09):
So we got this initial seed audience by chasing that early adopter set. And then, we also figured out these viral motions around our referral program, and shared folders. And so Dropbox started expanding virally for the first several years. And then a lot of the engineering that we applied to the product of Dropbox can't have a bad day when it comes to your wedding photos, and tax returns, and all the things people put in Dropbox. So we took a while to get the beta right before we felt comfortable opening up to the broader public.

(00:12:40):
But then, we applied that same engineering mentality to these viral loops. And this was all the era when social media was exploding, and Facebook, and Facebook platform. All these startups were setting new land speed records for fastest to 1,000,000 users, or 10,000,000 users. Things like Zynga. And all of this was built on this emerging playbook of virality, which in turn came from epidemiology. The study of the spread of viruses turned out to be a good parallel for the consumer internet. Draw your own conclusions.

(00:13:13):
And then we were like, "Oh, there's no reason this wouldn't work for Dropbox." And some of our early investors, Hadi and Ali Partovi, talked to us about how Facebook thought about growth. And then there were a lot of great people in the early days who had really fine-tuned, and mastered a lot of that. We tried many things. Conventional, and unconventional. But the things around virality, and the referral program really worked.

(00:13:39):
And so for the first several years, it was just doubling, 10-xing every year. Taping user counts that we printed out to the wall, and then running out of space on the wall. Having to put a 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000 on the ceiling. So it was wild. And it was super fun, but it was also super stressful. But going from maybe $6,000,000 valuation in 2007, to $27,000,000 in 2008, to then $4,000,000,000 valuation in 2011, being on magazine covers. Just that whole experience was wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):
The visual of the user numbers extending onto the ceiling is such a good one. Of just how quickly things grew. Okay. So let's transition to the second era. So things have been going great, keeps growing. Obviously, challenges along the way, but it feels like it's just grow, grow, grow. It feels like the year 2015 was a pivotal year where things started to shift. Does that sound right?

Drew Houston (00:14:43):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Okay. Yeah. Let's talk about that.

Drew Houston (00:14:46):
Yeah. Maybe the end of the first era, the start of our teenage years, would've been around 2013, or 2014. And maybe before that. 2011, 2012, we started getting all the incumbents, or all the big platform companies. Apple, Microsoft, Google. All of them launched competing products in one form, or another. But weirdly, it was like you see the videos where there's the mushroom cloud in the distance. You see it. But you don't hear, or notice it. So it mostly just seemed like nothing happened.

(00:15:27):
When Steve Jobs was on stage in 2011 announcing iCloud, calling out Dropbox by name as something that will be viewed as archaic. And similarly, we always felt like we were in the shadow of the hammer of Google launching Google Drive, which had been rumored long before we even started the company. For the first several years, we were just sort of quivering, waiting for the shoe to drop. And the product's launched, but you would never be able to look at our numbers and see when that happened. And the press often writes about competition like, "Oh, it's a shotgun blast."

(00:16:06):
When, later, I would learn it's more of a boa constrictor. But the end of that first chapter really culminated in us recognizing that we experienced a lot of benefits of being this kind of product for everyone. And in fact, it would be kind of hard for me to describe in the early days who Dropbox is for, or what it does. It was similar to what's a phone for, or what's a computer for? And in the beginning, that was a blessing. It meant that those viral loops would really work. Pretty much everybody you would hit would have a need for something like Dropbox. Either a personal need, or a work need, or both.

(00:16:43):
But we recognized even back then before competition that, "Hey, people are using us primarily for things like backup, backing up their devices, or storage. People are using us for photo sharing. People are using us as a collaborative space at work, and often, in huge companies." And then, we felt that there was a lot of tension between these use cases. So for example, the ideal file server replacement for an IT admin is going to look quite different from the ideal consumer photo sharing app. And we also recognize things like, "Well, we're going to be competing in many cases with the device, or the operating system."

(00:17:22):
When you look at something like iCloud, it's like, "Yeah. When you turn on your iPhone for the first time, it's probably not going to give you an ad for Dropbox." So we're like, "Hey, we need to address some of these issues," and expanded to some new areas to diversify. The first two things we did were, after getting enough complaints from IT administrators asking us what the hell these photo sharing features were for, we pulled all the photo sharing functionality out into a separate and new app we called Carousel. Where the basic value prop was phones, to that point, were limited in their storage by the amount of physical storage on the device.

(00:18:00):
We're like, "This is silly. You should be able to have your whole life in your pocket." So be able to store everything in the cloud, but have the experience be as if everything were locally there through a lot of caching, and sleight of hand, and thumbnails, and things like that. So there's much engineering there. And then, secondly, we saw people were using us at work, and we're like, "Well, there's a lot of different adjacent workflows." And there was a startup called Mailbox that built the first great mobile email client. Had a lot of funny parallels. They had a [inaudible 00:18:26]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):
Oh, that's right. They're famous for that waitlist.

Drew Houston (00:18:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):
That's a really good point.

Drew Houston (00:18:29):
Which was crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Yeah.

Drew Houston (00:18:30):
And so we're like, "I don't know. Maybe this is going to be our Instagram," and so we bought those guys. And then 2014, I'm on stage painting this picture of Dropbox's future. I'm like, "We're going to help be the way that you remember your life. We're going to be your productivity. The new productivity suite on your phone," and all these things. But then it was this dissonance where there were so many things that were going right, and certainly the numbers, user numbers, revenue numbers. We were sort of accidentally cash flow positive maybe a year after launching.

(00:19:06):
It was also clear that winter was coming, or that things weren't exactly as they seemed. Then the start of the second chapter, 2015, I'd start to hear a louder set of critics inside, and outside the company. And I'd been thinking for a long time like, "All right, man, we're really fighting wars on all these very disparate fronts." We're with storage. We're competing with the device to back up the device with photo sharing, or competing with Facebook, Snap, Instagram, Google, Apple.

(00:19:47):
On productivity, we're competing with Microsoft, and Google. And then, there's a whole new cohort of companies like Slack. And then, there's this experience of one day I am standing on stage talking about how Carousel, and Mailbox, and everything are the future of the company. Less than a year later, Google Photos launches. And not only does it provide a lot of the same value, and in many ways very inspired by what we had done, but they also gave you free unlimited storage for life. Not just photos, but video.

(00:20:24):
And so they just totally nuked our business model in ways that were bad enough in terms of just their obvious impact, but even worse because it was so easily anticipated. So this became a very public, and personal embarrassment for me. How could we not have predicted that, or been out in front of that? And then, that started this period. I'd say that was the beginning of chapter two where it was we went from the company that could do no wrong to the company that could do no right, which was a big flip. It was probably early summer, maybe late spring, when Google Photos launched.

(00:21:10):
At first, I'm just thinking like, "Okay. This was a big miss on my part. How do we get out of this? We need to tackle some of these competitive issues much more ahead on." And then, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that every incumbent is going to copy your product. They're going to bundle it with our platforms, and then they're going to kill the economics. And that was clear what was going to happen with Google Photos. It was very similar product experience bundled with Android, bundled with all of Google's different touch points, and then free.

(00:21:51):
So that was problematic enough for Carousel, but I'm like, "Wait, this is going to happen with everything that we're doing. Same thing with Mailbox." I had even pitch the founders to join Dropbox by saying, "Look, you're going to wake up tomorrow, and Gmail, and Apple Mail, and everything is just going to have these swipes and snoozes. The UI, it's not a durable source of advantage. We'll buy that problem from you."

(00:22:19):
And that's exactly what happened. So I'm like, "All right. Even in theory, how do we deal with this?" And I'd gotten the criticism over the years that Dropbox is a commodity, and investors in the early days would be like, "Hey, this is kind a graveyard of a space, and DOA." And I thought, "Well, how do other companies deal with this kind of competition, and commodities?" So there's a great book by AG Lafley and Roger Martin called Playing to Win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:53):
Roger's been on the podcast.

Drew Houston (00:22:54):
Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Roger's. And I was like, "All right. Well, if we think we're selling a commodity, try literally selling paper towels." Which is what AG, and Procter & Gamble, and a lot of CPG companies do. And AG was the CEO of Procter & Gamble at the time. And basically, he and Roger did this download of how they think about competition, and markets, and advantage. And a lot of it's thinking really critically about where do you play, and how do you win?

(00:23:28):
So being very selective about the markets you're in, and only being in markets where you can have a leadership position. And then, being really crisp about what is your leadership position? And so that was a very timely thing to read in terms of, "All right. Dropbox looks like one product, but it's really participating in many different markets. And our big risk might be that we're the number two best thing in each of those markets, which would be a bad situation."

(00:23:55):
Another really influential book was Only the Paranoid Survive by Andy Grove, and I'd been a big fan of Andy's. High Output Management is another great book of his, which was my introduction to management. At least, his theory of management. So just loved that book. And then Only the Paranoid Survive talks about Intel's experience where they actually had something like this happen that I wasn't aware of, and we all know Intel as the microprocessor company, Intel Inside. At least in the 80s, 90s.

(00:24:27):
But before, they were in microprocessors. They sold memory, RAM. In the 70s, they were running into a situation where they were really high growth, successful business selling memory. But then, they had these Japanese competitors that were just building memory faster, better, cheaper. Just on every dimension. And potentially, also, things like anti-competitive things where the government might be subsidizing these manufacturers. This feeling not only they might just be better at the game, but there's also not a level playing field.

(00:25:05):
But meanwhile, you wouldn't see it in their numbers. They're still growing. And just that there were these weird dissonant experiences where salespeople just suddenly have problems selling into accounts that used to be a slam dunk, or things that used to work just stop working. And this happens. Blackberry's, and Nokia's best sales years happened in the years after launching the iPhone. So these things don't actually change immediately. And so Andy labeled these moments strategic inflection points for a company, and I'm like, "Yeah. Then, we're definitely in a strategic inflection point."

(00:25:40):
But they were dealing with, "Oka., our whole business is memory. How do we deal with this competition?" And there's this little vignette where he and Gordon Moore, one of the other co-founders of Intel, said, "Hey, let's pretend we're consultants to ourselves. What would we do?" And what they immediately decided was, "Oh, well, we clearly get out of the memory business, and put all of our chips on this sketchy little microprocessor thing that was much smaller. But very high growth, and potentially big market." And then they're like, "Well, why don't we do that?"

(00:26:10):
Only problem with that is it's like Google saying, "Yeah. Let's get out of search, and go all in on Gmail, or something, or YouTube." So it just seemed insane. Andy cautions in the book that, "Look, most of the time CEOs want options. They want to hedge their bets, but what you really want to do in these strategic inflection points is go all in one thing." Or as Mark Twain put it, "Put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket." And I was like, "All right. This makes sense to me, but man, this is going to be painful." So we go away for 4th of July. I'm with my family in New Hampshire. I reread the book, I come back. All right. I'm like, "Well, we really got to do it." Then, I just killed Carousel, killed Mailbox. Went all in on productivity...

Drew Houston (00:27:00):
Killed mailbox, went all in on productivity. To some extent, that was a relatively easy decision because most of our subscribers, 80% of people paying for Dropbox were using it at work. But that meant foreclosing on photo sharing and consumer and storage and all these things that Dropbox had become synonymous with and to this day are some of the things that we're most recognized for. And I wish I could say then everything got better. It was the opposite, actually, the narrative completely flipped on the company. The press started, we killed these new products, and then internally and externally, the narrative became super negative. Articles would come out every week or two, like, oh, Dropbox could be the first dead deck of corn. And then sometimes we've all seen this in tech companies get in this washing machine of self-perpetuating negative press. And if it goes deep enough, I mean, Uber had this for a while later, Meta's had this over their history, lots of companies where you just can't get the monkey off your back.

(00:28:06):
And then because what the reporters end up doing is they basically park their metaphorical van behind your office. They interview all the people that you just fired and then print everything that they say anonymously as if it were facts. And there's a lot of truth to what the press were saying, so I can't really blame them or saying they were being unfair, but it immediately put recruiting into this deep freeze. You're just in the situation. You've started this company, it's been super successful, and then suddenly your employees don't want to wear your T-shirt anymore. And frankly, you don't even want to wear your T-shirt anymore. It's just your pride in your own company takes a big hit.

(00:28:50):
And meanwhile, I've talked mostly about the external market competitive forces, but inside the company was a mess too. The business's revenue had scaled so much faster than our ability to hire and build the right infrastructure and operations internally. And so everybody's just panicking and being like, "All right, well good, Drew, we're not doing Carousel, we're not doing Mailbox. What are we doing?" And the truth was like, if I knew the answer to that, we would be doing it, but it's just this is going to take some time to figure out. So it was pretty tough when everybody's looking to you as the founder and CEO looking for quick fixes and answers, and also just wondering, how the hell did you get us in this situation?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:36):
Wow. So we're going to talk about how you're actually turning things around and the work you're doing now, learning from this experience. But I have a lot of questions about this part of the journey.

Drew Houston (00:29:45):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Just to almost summarize the journey, it's like launch, killing it, viral, find all these opportunities, find all these big markets. You start three different product lines. There's the enterprise use case, there's the consumer file storage use case, there's photo sharing, there's productivity, and then basically every big incumbent's like, okay, great, we're going to come eat your lunch. And you end up fighting wars on three or four fronts against the big kahunas that have infinite cash and can do whatever they want. It's interesting the way you described the Apple launch of just like it was this mushroom cloud you didn't quite see for a while, but the Google Photos launch was like, okay, that was more clear of like, okay, this is bad news. I know it's always easy in hindsight of like, oh, I should have done something different when Apple launched this thing. But is there anything maybe you could have done, or was it even possible to have adjusted course at that point? Or was it like, okay, this is tough and we need time to figure it out?

Drew Houston (00:30:45):
Well, we panicked about the Apple thing too, because that also, that created a much smaller version of the tempest in a teapot that the Google Photos did. It was just much less public. Or it was just less obvious that we would be so out position. And actually we were more surprised to the upside when it's Google Drive launches, iCloud launches, OneDrive launches. And even as they build version two that we just didn't really notice that much of a problem. And I also studied over the years what happened in Netscape and companies like [inaudible 00:31:27] MySpace or these other cautionary tales. And interestingly, Internet Explorer was a thing that eventually undermined Netscape enough to permanently throw it into a negative trajectory. But Internet Explorer 1.0, 2.0, even maybe 3.0 just weren't that good and didn't really do anything but Internet Explorer 4.0, 5.0 and all the bundling, that really made a big difference, or big negative difference.

(00:31:55):
And then another thing that was interesting was, so there's a big time lag where between when these products launch and when they actually have an impact, because often it's not so much the existence of the product or it's availability, it's the constant bundling or the constant iteration, or it's the boa constrictor, in any given second, it's not much tighter, but over the following day, you're in a bad place.

(00:32:24):
But another thing that was interesting was one cool thing that we got to do and moving to California is you get to actually meet people who had been at these companies. And one of those people was a guy named Bill Campbell who was at Netscape during that whole period, and I had asked him, I'm like, "Man, that's really unfair. That sucks what happened with Microsoft and bundling with Windows and all these things and the antitrust and this and that." And he's looked at me, he laughed at and snorted and he's like, "Microsoft did not kill us. We killed ourselves." And so that was the other half of what was the problem within Dropbox was a lot of our wounds were self-inflicted in that we were struggling to keep scaling and launching all these products. And the Dropbox products had stagnated.

(00:33:25):
And I started to learn the hard way that, okay, yeah, I now understand what Bill is talking about, because we were hiring all these smart people, but the things we would do as a company would seem really stupid. And then some of these things were me personally, like yeah, I knew about from reading all these different things, but for whatever reason, I guess we just kept going anyhow. We were just too confident in our ability to respond, or we got lulled into this complacency, we were like, " Oh, well." Because it hasn't been a problem, it won't be a problem in the future.

(00:34:03):
But I'd say there's something about the Google Photos launch that just really set things off kilter. And then also for me personally, I think, I'd go from feeling good but stressed out all the time to mostly feeling bad all the time. And I just remember leaving, really trying to get away from the office for a little bit during this period, picked my teeth up off the ground. And the good news, I bought a place in Hawaii, so I was doing that in Hawaii, but didn't feel very good in any way.

(00:34:42):
And then I learned. I had to really figure out a lot of different things for myself to be the leader that could get us through this. Because mostly what I felt was like, man, I felt like we'd been doing such a good job, but now, man, if I really screw this up, or maybe I don't know what I'm doing. And then I had to really reset on a number of fronts. One is I just remember thinking my 18-year-old self would be like, what the hell are you complaining about? You did it. This is so great, and yet I felt so bad about things. And so I'm like, yeah, both of those things are true. How do I navigate that? And I think one part that was really helpful is getting a sense of equanimity basically, and doing a lot around mindfulness and meditation to distance... One thing that happens when you're a founder and your company succeeds is your identity is fused with the company. And so it's easy to get into a situation where you only feel good if the company's... Or how you feel is how the company is doing, and you need to separate that a little bit. So what that looked like for me is recognizing, yeah, there's really not an easy button that keeps things up and to the right forever. And most of the entrepreneurs that are my heroes had various periods of wandering in the desert. Those things instead of just being problems were probably the crucible that forged the people that they became. So the presence of badness is not necessarily you are bad. And it's like, yeah, now you're just getting your stripes as an entrepreneur.

(00:36:41):
And people were really helpful during that period. So I mentioned Bill Campbell. He was nice enough that we just stayed in touch and he would take me out to dinner every now and then. And I would be freaking out, but I was always surprised he'd never seemed to be freaking out. And mostly he'd just be saying like, all right, he'd dust you off and smack you and say, get your ass back out there. And he was literally a coach of the Columbia football team in addition to being a great technology executive and advisor to many of the great founders that I looked up to. He was really helpful because he helped me believe in myself even when I wouldn't believe in myself. And then people like Andy Grove who had written all these books, I'm like, well, at least I'm having this problem. But yeah, then that raised a question for me. I'm like, okay, I've been through this chapter one where everything's up and to the right, but I ran out of merit badges or Xbox achievements to collect. I was like, we did it. We got the product to this many users, we got it to where we got this valuation, or let me back up. So my whole life, or it's common, I think for a lot of founders, especially if you get good grades and stuff, you follow pretty linear path from childhood, from first get the right test scores, then get into the right college, get into the right college, take the right classes, get the right internship, get the right job. And early startup life is like that a lot. It's like, okay, have an idea. Find a co-founder, get into Y Combinator, get funding from Sequoia.

(00:38:22):
Watch an MVP just in 10 million, a hundred million, billion valuation. And I felt like we'd cleared all that. And so actually one of the other problems was, I don't even know what Dropbox needs to be and I don't even know what I need that I want to be in the world. And so part of this was also reconnecting to some kind of sense of purpose, because if I was really honest with myself, I was like, well, I'm just checking boxes and advancing and leveling up like a video game or something, but now I'm here. I'm like, all right, is it just big numbers bigger? It's also not that fun to just launch something that you put your soul into and then just have it get crushed with these competitors. It's even worse when you're bringing all these hundred other people who worked on that thing through that meat grinder too.

(00:39:10):
So are we just inventing things 10 minutes before Google and Apple do? If not, what are we doing? And then if we're really, really honest with ourselves, I think it's hard to argue that no one would've invented cloud photo gallery that wasn't constrained to your local storage. So I had to really rethink what does the company need to do. That actually took a longer time to answer than I wanted, but then also just what do I want to do? And I was like, well, you know what? I'm going to do this.

(00:39:45):
What I ended up settling on was like, look, coming back to my 18-year-old self, I was like, all right, stop complaining. This is a pretty good situation. You wanted something where the learning curve would be steep. Here it is. You get to do this really meaningful work to build things for millions of people, work with awesome teammates. There's always good things about it, and you've chosen this life, so stop complaining about the burdens because it's really dangerous if you start to resent the job or feel like a victim because that's just corrosive to everything else that you can get in this spin cycle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:20):
What helped you come to that place? Because that sounds like a very hard place to get to and a very important place. Was that Bill Campbell advice? How long did it take you to go from this is not going well and life sucks to, okay, let's look at it this way?

Drew Houston (00:40:35):
I think there were a couple unlocks that were pretty fast, but I think again, this was not like, oh, then I felt better and we lived happily ever after at all. There were some moments of recognition where I was able to, I always try to get away from the mayhem or the whirlwind and recenter myself and do think weeks and things like that. And so those were really helpful because I felt when I diagnosed, well, when I'm on this treadmill and just firefighting or how did I miss this important thing? It's like, well, basically the root causes of being on the treadmills, I was too busy firing to aim, and then I thought I would do my aiming on vacations and things like that. But no, I need to get off the treadmill every now and then and make the space to really address some of these bigger questions.

(00:41:31):
Because it's not like I didn't forget about them. They just were always below the fold on my to-do list to deal with. And then until a few years go by and you're like, wait. Yeah, we really were just strategically out of position. The other way I came to some of these conclusions is a combination of things. So I think picking up a meditation or mindfulness practice, having therapists personally, having coaches, having friends and mentors, other founder friends. And so I wouldn't say it was any one thing, but I think you have to build this whole ecosystem of support around yourself and recognize no one's going to do that for you. And it's super important.

(00:42:12):
And then to Bill's other point, he was like, yeah, Microsoft wasn't killing us, we were killing ourselves, I think having to ask some hard questions to myself of, yeah, some of these wounds were self-inflicted. As much as there might be, I could look at this and say, oh, Microsoft is mean, or Google was mean, or Apple was mean, but I'm like, I drove the ship towards these rocks. So that's one downside of being founder, CEO. You can't blame the last guy. I think one of the big questions every founder has to figure out is not just, how do I have equanimity? What's my purpose? But then also, what am I doing that is destroying the company?

(00:42:57):
Because everybody's got strengths and weaknesses, but as CEO, both your strengths and your weaknesses are massively amplified and a lot of blind spots in your personality can become huge cultural dysfunctions in the company. And so step one to dealing with that is building awareness. And one thing that floated around the company for a while was the Enneagram, which on the surface is a personality typing thing like Myers-Briggs. I often describe it as it's like Myers-Briggs, but actually useful. The way it works is it's a personality typing system. You get a number from one through nine that's your dominant... Or there's nine types that are numbered. It's similar to Myers-Briggs in that Myers-Briggs has 16 types of letters like ENFJ or different things. But I find that Myers-Briggs is more descriptive. So it tells you, okay, you're an introvert, not an extrovert or vice versa. You're judging instead of perceiving. But I could never really work out what that meant. And so it's descriptive versus predictive or causal.

(00:44:06):
Enneagram I find is the theory that is really about your fundamental motivations. What are you running towards and what are you running away from? And the theory goes through some combination of your wiring from your genetics and your early childhood. Your autopilot is fixed after your childhood in that you just have instinctive responses to things. Now it's autopilot. It doesn't mean it's your destiny. You could override it, but it's super important to become aware of what are you running from and towards. And the Enneagram gives you a really good map to do that.

(00:44:44):
And so I'm reading this book and it starts by you type yourself, and I'm rolling my eyes. I'm like, okay, I'm a seven. What's a seven? And then you read, each type has its own chapter and you read the chapter and I was like, oh my God, this completely describes who I am down to my core. And I was almost looking over my shoulder. Who the hell did this? I thought I was a special snowflake, but apparently not. Okay, I'm listening. And [inaudible 00:45:16] with a lot of my early coaching experiences, which are, you do a 360, your coach sits you down, they're like, here are your strengths. In my case, it would be things like, oh, you're really creative and you like new ideas. That's okay. And second, you really love people. You build great relationships with people. I'm like, okay. Uh-huh. Third, you're really comfortable in chaos and resilient. I was like, this coaching thing is great. See, yeah, that was my first coach. And then you flip to your development areas because no one calls them weaknesses.

(00:45:49):
It's like, all right, one is you're bored by routine and really undisciplined. Second is you're really conflict avoidant. And third is you're intuitive, but you're also pretty chaotic and don't create enough structure for people so they're mostly confused. And when you pair the two together, you're like, oh, wait. Yeah, I'm creative and like new ideas, but I'm bored by routine and I'm a bit of a space cadet. All right, you love good relationships with people, but you don't want to make them unhappy so you don't tell them the truth basically about things that are difficult to hear. And it's going to be a similar map of things depending on your personality type or circumstances. But the Enneagram was that map for me to be like, okay, I've got these things that are genuinely great, but I need to address these downsides of the company's conflict avoidant, so we're not telling the truth and then making a bunch of predictable mistakes, or I'm creating this really chaotic environment where people don't know what they're supposed to be doing.

(00:46:57):
That's a problem. My personality is quite directly, I'm going to torpedo the company unless I do something about it. The same is true for any founder. And I'm a type seven, it's the enthusiast. It's like, again, central casting is like a lot of new things and creative and love just interesting things. But then a space cadet, FOMO, some of the shadow side of it, and every type has a thing like that. So really understanding, okay then, I was also just frustrated in the day-to-day of my work, I'm like, yeah, I'm not really getting to do these creative things where I'm too busy firing to aim. I'm missing these bigger picture things that are really taking the ship way too close to the rocks. Okay. Then I need to then understand what those things are and either work on myself or hire the right people who don't have those issues or one way or another, just make it so the company is not so exposed to my personal dysfunction.

(00:47:56):
And so yeah, it was a whole constellation of things like that where it's like, all right, we have to get... I mean, after this whole tailspin, we got to work. I'm like, all right, first business issues. The most urgent issues were just blowing all this cash. We need to get the P&L to look a lot better and get out of this land grab mode or fighting with Google on giving more free storage away or just being in these fundamentally unprofitable things. And so we did that. We cut the unprofitable parts of the business. We turned cash flow positive in 2016, maybe several months after this reckoning, and that set the tracks for getting into a billion run rate in 2017, going public in 2018.

(00:48:40):
We had to come up with a new vision and mission for the company, which I'll maybe save for chapter three. And then I was also just trying to do things that helped sustain me through the difficult things. I'm like, well, I am an engineer. As a little kid, I was coding since childhood. I knew I wanted be a founder. I didn't know I wanted be a CEO, so I backed into being a CEO. And then, so I'm like, man, there's a lot of tedious things about being an executive. So I was like, I'm going to find ways to automate tedious parts of my job and learn machine learning in 2016 and '17, and that ended up being really important later on. But then also it's just coming to terms with my job and what I wanted to do from a personal perspective, which included things like, oh, I'm lucky in that being a CEO is, I always wanted a steep learning curve.

(00:49:33):
In a lot of professions like in sports or math or chess or certain academic fields, you peak in your twenties or thirties. CEO's not like that. You can go your whole life and still not be a master. So I'm like, for better or worse, it's pretty cool that I can do this kind of work. And then I don't really get that much out of just chasing bigger numbers. The thing that is my favorite thing about Dropbox is looking over someone's shoulder in Starbucks and seeing if the little Dropbox icon is there. Building something that becomes a verb, taking some of the pain out of technology, things like that. So really reorienting. Yeah, it's not about just the external scoreboard just much. It's more about the craft of being a great CEO and building things I'm really proud of or really making a difference. And so those kinds of things, none of them all coalesce. It's like this lens that slowly and stubbornly comes into focus, but making the time to have some of that reflection was super important.

# How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)

## Transcript

Elizabeth Stone (00:00:00):
We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density. And in some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. And in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior.

Lenny (00:01:06):
Today my guest is Elizabeth Stone. Elizabeth is chief technology officer at Netflix, and as far as I can tell, the first economist to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company. Prior to this role, Elizabeth was vice president of Data and Insights. Before Netflix, she was vice president of science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst Group. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. We talk about how an economics background has helped Elizabeth in her career and why she expects to see more economists rise in the ranks of tech companies. She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly at so many companies so consistently. We delve into Netflix's very unique culture of high talent density, radical candor, and freedom and responsibility. We also talk about the structure that Netflix has for their data and user research teams, which she believes is a part of Netflix's secret to success. We also get into what biking and triathlons have taught Elizabeth about life and how she brings that into her work and so much more.

Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Elizabeth Stone (00:04:41):
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:04:43):
So when we booked this conversation, you are VP of data in Netflix. And since then you got a promotion, you're now the CTO of Netflix, which feels significantly more fancy. Question for you, what is life like now that you are CTO versus VP of data? How is it most different? I'm imagining more meetings.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:01):
I would say the biggest thing that changed is probably the amount of context switching and the degree to which I feel behind or I have a lot to learn. And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the VP of data and insights role that I was in before in part because we cover a lot of different areas of the business and there's always people to learn from, but the engineering organization just takes that to 100 basically. So more people to get to know, more problem spaces, aspects of technical expertise that I'm just not as deeply familiar with. And yeah, a lot more meetings.

Lenny (00:05:41):
I imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:44):
Yes. So thankfully not a lot of meetings that Netflix feel like now you're really in this scary room, but it does feel like the role has more consequence, which is actually an exciting thing.

Lenny (00:05:57):
Kind along the lines of what you just talked about being a CTO. Your background is actually unusual. You're a trained economist, you got a PhD in economics. And from what I can tell, you're the first CTO of Fortune 500 company that is an economist trained in economics. First of all, is that true? I don't know if I think that's true, but you tell me.

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:16):
I have not checked the list. That was one of the things I did not do after getting the title. It might be unusual. I've heard a lot of feedback on that, so I don't know if I'm the one and only, but I will definitely say it's probably unusual.

Lenny (00:06:30):
Yeah. So I guess the question is just, do you think this is an anomaly and going to continue to be really rare? Do you think this some are going to see more at tech companies? And generally do you think tech companies should hire more economists?

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:41):
Yes to the last question. That's the easiest of it. But one of the things I observed even with the focus on data science where I've been deeper for a period of time is that economics is a flavor of data science. So it is a set of technical skills for sure. It's a way of framing certain problems or solving challenges.

(00:07:06):
And so when I was first switching from economics into tech, it was before there was a lot of sort of the frenzy around data science that we've seen more recently and it was harder to make that argument that economics is a flavor of data science and maybe complimentary to other versions of data science. And I feel more strongly about that now that I've seen it up close. And so maybe by extension I would say just like I think data science can be helpful for a lot of different problems that you might not immediately think, "Oh, this is something that we should bring data to," I think that economics is generally valuable for a lot of different challenges and it's a useful perspective to add to things, especially in a business context and especially in how we want to simplify problems in a way that makes them feel tractable.

(00:08:00):
So I feel like that's been a benefit to me to have had that type of formal training and then bring that perspective or way of thinking to different roles. And so I don't know that many people at Netflix think of me as an economist, but I find it comes out in the way I think about things. So to the extent that that's true generally, I think it's useful in a lot of companies. And I feel like even since I made the switch towards tech, I've seen it become much, much more common to think about the value of having economists on teams.

Lenny (00:08:32):
Just to pull on that thread a little bit more, is there something very tactical or concrete that you can share that you find helpful with that background that you found helpful in your career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:08:42):
Other than the dismal dry science of it all? So one example would probably be in an understanding incentives and thinking about unintended consequences. I think that that is true both in terms of internal leadership, so being part of a management team that's thinking about how do we clarify priorities or motivate a company or define the problems we want to solve. And then part of it is more externally oriented. How do we want to think about what Netflix is to consumers and how we want to think about competition?

(00:09:24):
There can be a rational way of thought, which is one version of economics of shouldn't rational intelligent people behave in the following way. And then there's the, well, if given certain incentives, what might you see that we didn't think was optimal or we weren't expecting to happen but could be a consequence or repercussion here? And so I think that that type of framing, I don't know if it's unique to economics in a way because it has elements of psychology to it as well and planning ahead has become really useful for thinking through cause and effect. So that has come up in a lot of different spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've been in.

Lenny (00:10:08):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and looking at your career over the years. It seems like you've had a meteoric rise at four different companies. And I'll just walk through them briefly. So at your first job, you went from associate to vice president in three years. At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager of data science to COO in two years. At Netflix you went from VP to CTO in three years. I think that's really rare. I'm curious what is your secret sauce to being so successful at so many places and especially in the context of what advice can you share with folks earlier in their career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:10:46):
This is one of those questions that sparks the reflection that I wouldn't normally do, so that's great. I really don't think of it as a secret sauce, but maybe I can walk through some of the things that I think have been instrumental. As you listed that out, it sounds like the two to three year point is the real sweet spot, so maybe there's something about that timeline. But I think some things almost feel trite in how I would say them, which is I'm very dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm part of. It's been part who I am for a long time that I give everything I've got to the job that I'm in. And I think that dedication and that I get joy out of that has mattered. It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing. I do the best work I possibly can, less so for myself and my own ambition and more so because I think of myself as being part of a team and so I really need to deliver for that team.

(00:11:52):
I think that framing in my mind and that motivation has helped me in a few fronts, which is the way in which I build partnerships with people I work with that I really care about setting other people up for success and being someone that people want to work with, so I learn from them, they learn from me, and we get better outcomes for the business together, I have found that part of that is being someone that people can leverage to translate from technical to non-technical and non-technical to technical. So that I do think has been a relative advantage in my role. So while I was often sitting in more technically-oriented teams, a lot of the advancement in my career was to roles that required that type of communication fluency. It grew out of being able to partner with people across the businesses who didn't necessarily have the same background, but where we needed to really connect spaces so that we could be more effective.

(00:12:57):
That was something that I think really the training for that came from analysis group where it was a very quantitative set of work that we had to find a way to communicate to judges and juries for economic cases. So that was something that was trained in other roles and I think I've been able to leverage. I'm a relatively introverted only child, so I observe a lot, which means that I learned from other people. And in each of these roles I have tried really hard to watch what other people are doing, think about how could I learn something from them, whether it's the thing that I want to be able to do myself or it's the thing that I think, "Oh, that doesn't quite fit or feel authentic with my style." And I do a lot of that introspection. So I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation and then have been able to leverage that to be stronger in the roles I was sitting in.

Lenny (00:14:00):
I took a few notes here. A few things you mentioned is just like, dedication, essentially working really hard and taking your work seriously, being part of a team and setting other people up for success, translating complex tech language and problems to non-tech people, and then being really good at observing and learning from other people around you. Is there an example or two that you could share of some of these to make it even more concrete for people? Like dedication. Is that just like working many hours, being part of a team? Anything along those lines to share a story maybe to help people put this into practice.

Elizabeth Stone (00:14:35):
No, and it's a good clarification because the dedication piece really isn't about long working hours. It's more about how much I care about excellence, I guess. So giving it my best in those situations. And that might not mean that I work really wild hours or I work weekends or I'm the one who's willing to sacrifice the vacation. I've actually tried to avoid setting that as an expectation, but more that I hold myself to a very high standard.

(00:15:13):
So an example would be, especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me. So whether it's the timing for a meeting or providing input on something or reviewing a document or following through on something I said that I was going to do, and I really try to avoid that, which means that if someone sends me something, I try to be very responsive about it. If I know that I said I'm going to do something, I follow through on it in the timeline that I said I was going to do. If I have a meeting, I try to be on time to that meeting.

(00:16:01):
Those are all flavors of dedication to the work that show up in, "Oh, it seems like Elizabeth works really hard," but the motivation factor is other people are relying on me and I want to show up for them. And so that's when I say dedication and it's related to the second point around showing up well for the team, those would all be examples of I feel urgency in responding to people and doing high quality work.

(00:16:27):
For the other parts of technical to non-technical, I think a great example is actually a very timely one at Netflix, which is, we are making strides to offer live content types. So live events, live TV shows. We announced this week that we're going to be hosting WWE starting later this year and early next year, 2025. That is easier said than done. I know that there's a lot of entertainment companies that have live content. But Netflix has really been in the streaming content business, so live content is something new for us and it's something that's going to require a really close partnership between our content organization and our products and technology organization because there's a content strategy to it, there's a business strategy, there's a technology strategy to it. A big part of my role is, can I explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds competence with the content team? Can I try to understand their content strategy in a way that sets the technical teams up for success and we understand what we need to be able to deliver on here in terms of requirements.

(00:17:46):
I don't think I'd be able to do my current role well if I wasn't able to do that type of translation for something that's going to be a big bet for the business and something we want to invest in jointly. And then to set my partners up for success in that. So I am going to do everything I can to make sure we deliver well for my content partners because I feel like that's what's best for Netflix in the business.

Lenny (00:18:09):
Amazing examples. In terms of life content, I think about the Love is Blind. I think it was for premier, whatever, reunion that we got sucked into that show. So good job. And I think there were some issues with that, right? That reunion streak.

Elizabeth Stone (00:18:24):
Well, yeah, that was about a little less than a year ago now. So the amazing thing about failure is you learn a lot. We learned a lot. We've taken notes on it and we had a couple successful events after that, including the Netflix Cup last October. And we've got some exciting events coming up. So I think that's something that strengthened us, but did reveal that we're tackling a hard problem.

Lenny (00:18:50):
Yeah, the Twitter feeds during that, Love is Blind premiere were hilarious. People are pissed.

(00:18:57):
Okay. And then in terms of the, keeping a high bar for yourself, I love that. I think about a quote that... There's a VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate and she did this interview with Tim Ferris. She shared that her dad always asked her, "Are you doing a World-class job with this? Are you doing a world-class job with your homework? Are you doing a world-class job with your piano recital?" And that's the bar that he always had for her. And I feel like that's a really good way to think about work and life in general if you can.

Elizabeth Stone (00:19:28):
Yeah, my mother used to describe to me, probably still does, though it required more repeating when I was younger, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered. And so it is that framing of the extra effort you put into something to make it world-class or to make it excellent. And so I do like to push myself that way and I hope it sets a good example for other people too. It's very consistent with especially the company cultures that I tend to thrive in where that's the general expectation of the culture. So you don't feel like you're doing it alone, because then I think you can start to feel frustrated by that.

Lenny (00:20:15):
I know that this is a big part of Netflix culture and I want to get into it. But before that, I'm curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in this skill of having a really high bar? And an example I'll give as you think about maybe an example is the way I described this to my PMs was, you want to have this aura that you've got this that, "If you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I feel like this thread will not disappear. He won't drop this ball." Is there anything that you've learned as a good way to help someone learn this kind of skill, understand why this is so important?

Elizabeth Stone (00:20:53):
It shows up for the people who report to me, is one part example setting. So if I don't do it, why would they do it? I treat that very seriously that we should all be held to the same standards.

(00:21:12):
And as a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard. So I think one of the things I've observed especially with people on my teams is that the expectations aren't always clear and you can't assume that they're clear if you don't share them. When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I am expecting or to show up in the way that I'm expecting.

(00:21:55):
And then the third and probably most important thing is help them fill that gap. So that would mean... Let's take an example. It certainly has happened frequently in many jobs. A document is okay, it's not great, it's not going to be easy for people to follow, it's not as crisp as it could be. There's things that would strengthen it. I can both give the feedback on that to make sure like, yes, it's going to take another round of iteration, yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it, but pushing people to get there, and then jumping into the document and helping.

(00:22:32):
So I feel very strongly about, and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example of like, "Let's work on this together," and then through that, help people uplevel themselves so the next time around they know the expectations and they've had help getting there in the past. So that's probably happened a thousand times in my career where I jump in with both feet because something needs to be better and I think the teams are better for it afterwards, or I hope they are.

Lenny (00:23:00):
I think that's such a good framework just to kind of mirror back what you said, "Set expectations that the bar is going to be really high and here's what I'm expecting from you." Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them fill that gap. I think a lot of people may feel this and hear this and they're like, "Oh man, I don't want a manager that's like this high of an expectation person and it just feels really stressful." But I've had these managers and I feel like that's when I've learned the most and leveled up the most, is having someone that had really high expectations and then helped me understand, "Here's where you're not doing as well as you can. I know you can do better. Go back and work on this." I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice it ends up helping you most in your career. I imagine you've seen a similar result.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:45):
I think so. I mean you'd have to ask some of the people on my team. So I might look at it differently that they look at it.

Lenny (00:23:51):
[inaudible 00:23:52] differences.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:53):
It's a hard skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like you know someone's put a lot of effort into something. And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver that feedback so it feels like we're on the same team and I'm trying to help them be successful, not to help encourage failure. And that's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping in to help can make people feel like, "I'm in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful. My manager's helping me here." I do often do that behind the scenes. So maybe that's another flavor of this, which is, I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of all the people where the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer space to say, "Here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time." So it gives people a little grace and a little bit of an ability to absorb that feedback without feeling like it's kind of on a stage.

Lenny (00:25:02):
Another thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is like, "Oh my god, it's going to take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with." And I know you said that this doesn't mean necessarily many hours. Do you have any advice or thoughts on just how to avoid burnout and working all the time, but also keeping this really high bar and high expectations?

Elizabeth Stone (00:25:21):
It truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying, "If we're clear on the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time. So if we're going to come together to talk through..." Like quarterly business review was the example, what were the highlights? What were the low lights? What were the learnings from the quarter? Where are there places of misalignment? The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going, to have a debate about things where maybe we're stuck. It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation.

(00:26:08):
So my feedback in that instance would be, I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about what's the conversation we really want to have? "How do I tee that up?" Not, "Could I spend another 20 hours to make it look like everything's perfect in this document?" And so I think in that sense it's not just excellence, like you wrote the perfect document, I should probably be careful to not use that as the only example, but instead we really got to the outcome we wanted to get to because we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot of energy and time and iteration into making sure we got to that outcome.

Lenny (00:26:43):
And is this an example where you gave someone feedback that they spent too much time on the polish or is this earlier? And to give the pyramid of this framework you kind of shared of set expectations, give specific feedback, help them fill the gap and then do it in private, is this the expectation setting in this example or is this feedback you spend too much time on this?

Elizabeth Stone (00:27:01):
This is expectation setting. So one of the things in my new role is that there's some practices that the team has had where they're trying to understand, Are we still going to have those practices? What's going to be the same versus different about those things?" and get an understanding of my expectations. So it's great that people ask that question so that I can be clear about, "Oh wait, if you're on the last 20% of this polishing the dock, I'd rather spend time over here. And here's how I would like the conversation to go so we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like it's just a leadership reviewer on my behalf." So in this specific situation, it was setting expectations ahead of time so that we can set everyone up for success.

Lenny (00:27:44):
Awesome. Okay. So we've kind of been talking around this, but this is an important part of the Netflix culture. Just broadly, Netflix has a really special and unique culture. Even though it's been around for I think over 25 years now, it feels like the culture has come up many times. There's that initial culture deck that came out that blew everyone's minds. There's a recent book, No Rules Rules I think it's called. And it feels like Netflix has done a great job at maintaining its culture.

(00:28:10):
It feels to me there's these three important elements, and maybe there's more. One is very high talent density and a focus on high performers. Two is candor and being really direct. And then three is giving people freedom and responsibility and getting rid of useless processes like vacation time and things like that. So maybe just to dive into that first one of high talent density and this focus on high performance. I guess the question there is just like, what does this look like in Netflix? And I imagine part of it is hiring, part of it is performance reviews. And then just why is it so important? Why is this such a focus on Netflix? What happens when you have such a high talent density?

Elizabeth Stone (00:28:51):
It's just so intrinsic to who Netflix is as a company. And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes and that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.

(00:29:37):
A big piece of that talent density is definitely hiring. So who are the people coming in and joining the team? But a lot of it is, we can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density.

(00:30:03):
And so in some ways it's not the end, it's the means to the end in what Reed and the rest of the leadership team has been trying to build. And so in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback, this gets into the second bucket. So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations when they're not being met, what could be better in helping people improve, and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high? Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being and stays a perfect human being the whole time. We all have ways that we could grow and improve. And so in order to keep that bar high, you have to be willing to have those types of very uncomfortable conversations. It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback in order to keep that bar high.

(00:31:10):
And then the other piece of it is another thing that doesn't come naturally to humans, which is making a call in pretty timely fashion if someone's not able to meet the bar, and to say either, "I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role, or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you," and to make that something that is part of best practice to get to a point where you could make that decision. And that's where we refer to the keepers test, which is really just a mental framing to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this. Where if I'm asking myself the question, "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?" If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, "Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?", if I might be a little bit relieved if you said you were leaving.

(00:32:20):
The reason the keeper test and that question is useful is because no one wants to think that way. It's very hard to say to someone, "I think this isn't the right fit. I think you should move on from the company." So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior. And we also then want to get to a place where when you're having that tough conversation, people aren't surprised by it. That is easier said than done. But you can only get to that conversation around, "I don't think Netflix and you are the right fit for one another" if you've been giving feedback along the way. And so it feels like in its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation. In practice, it's not always that smooth. Obviously we are humans. But that all feeds on itself in order to make sure that we're really holding ourselves to what we say our behavioral norms as part of the culture.

Lenny (00:33:17):
How is that operationalized? Is that just mental model that you should have in mind? Or is it like every quarter you should go through this exercise? Is it part of the performance review process? How does that actually operationalize at Netflix?

Elizabeth Stone (00:33:29):
It's definitely a mental model. So when we talk to managers about what does it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would mean you should be with some frequency asking yourself this about the people on your team. People ask me frequently, "Am I passing your keeper test?" So it becomes part of a regular manager direct report, one on one. And it is just another way of saying, "Am I meeting your expectations? What's going well? What's not going well? How are you thinking about things?" And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have. So in the middle of a lot of like, "We have to talk about this project or that deliverable or this thing that's happening," to take the time to step back and just say, "How am I doing?", can feel loaded sometimes. And the keeper test, while it feels like a very heavy concept, creates a lightness around being able to have that conversation regularly. So we do operationalize it. A point that you made, I'll just clarify, we don't have performance reviews.

Lenny (00:34:33):
Oh, wow.

Elizabeth Stone (00:34:34):
So we don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we would think about reflecting on a rating of how things are going. We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from a lot of people, but it's not an input to some output, it's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle. And we have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how are people doing? And so you think about performance as part of both promotions and as part of compensation, but in that way it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Interesting. I didn't know that. So the idea there is just ongoing, like the whole... So what many people dream of, no performance reviews, we'll give you ongoing real-time feedback. We don't have to wait six months. I feel like people talk about this but rarely do this, but that's how you guys operate.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:36):
In ideal.

Lenny (00:35:37):
In ideal, yeah.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:38):
In practice. It's like you have to keep reminding yourself, "This is our ideal" because it's really easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle. And all of a sudden I do get about 300 pieces of feedback. And some of those things are on things that happened six months ago and I think, "Oh, I wish you had told me this at the time, that would've been more living the Netflix culture." So we have to push ourselves to do it that way. But yeah, that is if working well, it's very timely direct feedback. The 360 site goal is sort of the annual check-in on, "Let me get the full picture. Let me be able to distill some themes. Let me tee it up for a conversation with my manager." And then it does remove the sort of crutch of an every six month performance review or something like that.

Lenny (00:36:31):
When you talked about this example of someone asking you often, "Am I meeting your keeper test?", it makes me feel like someone's just super nervous. They're like, "Am I passing your keeper test?" And it makes me feel like it could create a culture of just like a lot of stress and worry and this hunger games mentality of like, "I got to compete and worry and I might die or get fired any day." I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural. This is just the way we work. You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this keeper test. How do you avoid this just constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you may not be hitting the bar?

Elizabeth Stone (00:37:08):
In my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations than by not having them. So in many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or things I could be doing better on, and I didn't quite know how to get that information. And that made me feel much more stressed or nervous or at risk than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations.

(00:37:45):
So the thing that I think can be nerve wracking, and I feel it myself, is the high bar for excellence at Netflix and if we're doing this while you're surrounded by amazing people. And that can feed a sense of, "Am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else is doing? I know the bar's high." For the most part, that can drive people and in a good way, but in some ways it makes people nervous. And that's where I think it's helpful to know we expect to have these conversations so you can just kind of let your shoulders relax a little bit of, "Yes, the expectations are high, but my manager says I'm doing a great job, or my manager says I'm not doing a great job, but they gave me concrete things that I could do better." And so I think knowing is better than not. And so in that sense, it's the culture combined with the conversations around performance I hope take a little bit of that stress out of it. But I've certainly heard it a lot that without that conversation, people can be nervous.

Lenny (00:38:49):
That's such a good point and such a good example that I feel like every company wants to have a high bar and have only high performers and keep the bar really high for every person they hire. I'm curious, I know this could be its own podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring people that are amazing and keeping this bar of excellence, is there anything you can point out that might be helpful to other companies hiring to help identify amazing people and make sure that bar stays high? One thing I know is you guys pay a top market for salary. I think that's one unique thing about Netflix, is we just pay people. So maybe that's an part of this answer, but just what advice do you have for people to keep a really high bar in their talent?

Elizabeth Stone (00:39:33):
Yeah, I mean on the compensation point, we pay what we call personal top of market, meaning we want to be highly competitive in the pay, but we don't want pay to be like the golden handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than paying people a strongly competitive compensation. So I think that that's important for attracting and retaining talent and has been a big part of the culture, but almost more importantly, we hope we don't have to rely on that to want people to want to be at Netflix or for us to be able to assess whether people are going to thrive at Netflix.

(00:40:20):
The way that I've thought about hiring with that context is we know we're going to offer you very highly competitive compensation, but are you going to come to Netflix and help us identify the right problems to solve or new ways to solve existing problems? And that's a different way of hiring than you might think about, especially at scale where you're saying, "Does this person have this skill, this skill, this skill? Check they're going to fit in this box and they're going to deliver this work that I need them to do." I'm being intentionally simplistic. I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually that way. But at Netflix we try really hard to say we're looking for the new perspective or the person who's actually going to make us stronger as a team. So thinking about additive skills, additive perspectives, people who are going to push our thinking on something. That tends to help us with thinking about talent density because you're constantly introducing people to the team who uplevel.

(00:41:25):
So then the questions you have to ask in an interview might be different because yes, we're trying to assess do you have the baseline skills to be successful here, but we're also looking for the things that make people exceptional or even stronger than the team we've got. And then you think about making the magical teams comprised of all those amazing minds and what can you get out of that. And that feels like more that the talent density and practice.

Lenny (00:41:50):
Got it. So the advice there essentially is, don't look for someone just simply great. Look for someone that raises the bar for the whole team, brings in a whole new perspective.

Elizabeth Stone (00:41:58):
Yes. That's a great way to say it. Yeah, it's a good way to say it.

Lenny (00:42:00):
I think what's great about this idea of just maintaining excellence consistently is that the best people want to work with the best people. And as soon as there's one person that sucks and the company allows for that, it just brings everyone down because they know, "Hey, we can be okay. We'll stick or no one's going to do anything about it." And when you make it clear, we only want the best and only hire the best and only keep the best, it keeps the best there, right? I imagine that's part of the strategy.

Elizabeth Stone (00:42:29):
Yeah. It's definitely the goal. And I think understanding that having gaps in the team and people's skillsets or their behavior can be really toxic for other people on the team. So it's a cost.

Lenny (00:42:42):
This episode is brought to you by Xplo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports, and analytics within your product?

(00:43:54):
So I asked on Twitter what questions to ask you. And there's a great question that came in from Nan Yu. He's the head of product for Linear and he asks, "What practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do because their talent level is so much higher than other companies?"

Elizabeth Stone (00:44:15):
That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell. So let me explain that. It's a good question. It's kind of related to what I was saying earlier, that talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate. So if we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems or the scope of problems that they could tackle, assuming they're highly impactful for the business, and we don't have a lot of process around that work, so think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation, we get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore and question things and experiment in a way with solutions. I think that that would be very hard if not dangerous if we didn't have a high talent density.

(00:45:32):
It's really not a top down do A, then B, then C. Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or thinking about how we think about priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team and that requires talent density. And then there's things like you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders experience. We do give people a lot of responsibility on those things. So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on we've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment.

Lenny (00:46:18):
This is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice is, "Just hire amazing people, get out of their way and let them do their job," which is often not a successful experience. What are examples that either things that came out of this freedom, I don't know, products or features or ideas that came out of this or policies or processes you don't have that everyone else might have? So I know there's no vacation time, there's unlimited vacation time, I assume. Is that still a thing? Unlimited vacation time?

Elizabeth Stone (00:46:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:49):
Okay, cool. All right, great. And I know performance reviews, you talked about that. So I guess in either direction, is there an example of something that came out of this freedom or some process that which surprised people that you don't have or a framework or system?

Elizabeth Stone (00:47:05):
We've been able to deliver... I'll speak to my own team around innovations in our content delivery network or innovations in encoding or innovations in discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, "I think this is a priority." They were driven in many cases by individual contributors who had great ideas for innovation. So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded in, came from creating space for people on the team. So there's probably thousands of examples of product features and things like that that came out of creating this space. And right now, the trick is finding the sweet spot so that we can operate efficiently at this type of scale without snuffing out some of that, what was kind of the core beauty of the culture.

Lenny (00:47:55):
Maybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit. I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, "Oh wow, that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor."

Elizabeth Stone (00:48:15):
There's a couple things that come to mind. I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well. And in practice, that means I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes it's just letting people know, "Here's what leadership's talking about so that they have a sense of what's top of mind." But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about, doesn't exist a lot of other places. I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share... I can't always share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that probably push the boundary a little bit in the team, feeling like they understand what's happening across the company and what I'm thinking about.

(00:49:22):
And then there's a second example that comes to mind, which is, until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix. So all engineers were just senior engineers, all data scientists were senior data scientists, and we did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago almost exactly. And it was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred of it. A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions. This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews, because promotions really weren't at play. And it gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry about that type of structure. But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type of scaffolding to say, "We want to talk about how we compose teams. When do we need the person who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad?" Because that's what the work requires. We didn't have a language for it.

(00:50:27):
So I introduced Levels a couple of years ago and we had quite a change rollercoaster is the only way I can describe how it went.

Lenny (00:50:38):
That's a good phrase.

Elizabeth Stone (00:50:40):
Yeah, it was sort of like being the tumble dry machine for a few months, and so really talking through it with the team. That's just context and backdrop. For an example of candor recently, which is, we had kind of a postmortem or a retro on how has it gone with IC levels. So it's kind of like wells, not wells. And I would normally think in a lot of cultures it would be like, "Well, we got past that change. We're living that change." Don't reflect on it. Because that kind of opened some of that early debate. And I felt differently about it. I think it's a good example of being candid about, this was a big change for us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better in how we implement levels at Netflix. And I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and we achieved every objective. So I think that I try to build examples like that because I do think that level of candor and reflection helps build the sense of community and trust across the team.

Lenny (00:51:44):
That's an awesome example. Kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom and responsibility, something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this idea of Chaos Monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure that just kills random processes and things and just to see what breaks and make sure things are stable when things actually start falling apart. Is Chaos Monkeys... Was that what it's called? And then is that still a thing? Is there still some Chaos Monkeys running around the servers?

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:19):
Not unbridled Chaos Monkeys. No.

Lenny (00:52:22):
Okay. Contains chaos and niche.

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:24):
Bur no, we carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member experience to inject pain, though we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience, and that does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than B. And so that happens across engineering systems really at scale. But it is not for pure chaos, it's for intentional learning and so we can avoid making bigger mistakes. And then as we go into new efforts like cloud games, we have a beta that's out now, Live would be another example. We do try to come up with intentionally low profile examples where we can test the bounds of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience. But that's less randomness, more by design. And so we're doing that in a few places that feels mostly good engineering practice so we can understand when it's really showtime and we're going to really test our systems, will they be able to perform like we want them to.

Lenny (00:53:42):
RIP Chaos Monkey.

Elizabeth Stone (00:53:45):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:47):
So kind of along these lines of data, so data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix. My understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful. And that's the team you led before you moved into this new role. Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective?

Elizabeth Stone (00:54:14):
Yeah. I certainly like to think of it as being special. It's unusual. I can explain why. So the scale of company that Netflix now is very often data oriented teams are embedded in other parts of the business. So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they are organized more functionally separating data engineers from data scientists, from analytics engineers, from consumer researchers. We've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse. So across all those types of functions that I just described and works on nearly every area of the business from within the team. I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this because it really does require basically extraordinary partnership that we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that are relying on them.

(00:55:30):
But the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise. So are we really world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists? And how do we continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective? It gives people better career paths because there's more mobility across the teams. It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems to solve. And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way.

# Taking control of your career | Ethan Evans (Amazon)

## Transcript

Ethan Evans (00:00:00):
People think invention takes all this time, but you only need two hours once a month. The thing is, once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.

(00:00:09):
So you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, "Let's have Prime shipping." Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle, a decades old idea now still getting better. The point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive.

Lenny (00:00:38):
Today my guest is Ethan Evans. Ethan is a former vice president at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator focused on helping leaders grow into executives. Ethan spent 15 years at Amazon, helped invent and run Prime Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce, which alone is a billion-dollar business for Amazon. He led global teams of over 800, helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles, holds over 70 patents, and currently spends his time executive coaching and running courses to help people advance in their career, build leadership skills, and succeed in senior roles.

(00:01:14):
In our conversation, Ethan shares an amazing story of when he failed on an important project for Jeff Bezos and what he learned from that experience. We spent some time on something called The Magic Loop, which is a very simple idea that I guarantee will help you get promoted and advance in your career. We also get into a bunch of other career advice, primarily for senior ICs, any managers. We get into advice for standing out in interviews, plus some of Amazon's most important and impactful leadership principles and much more. I learned a lot from Ethan and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Ethan Evans after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:01:50):
Let me tell you about our product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up.

(00:04:26):
Ethan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ethan Evans (00:04:30):
Lenny, thank you a ton for having me. I'm super excited to talk about some of the things we have teed up today and to help people.

Lenny (00:04:37):
The first thing I thought we could chat about is The Magic Loop. So you wrote this guest post from my newsletter sometime earlier this year. It is, I don't know if you know this, but it's currently the sixth most popular post of all time on my newsletter across 300 plus posts. Did you expect this advice to resonate the way that it did, and why do you think it resonated as much as it did?

Ethan Evans (00:04:59):
So the competitive part of me really wants to analyze spots one to five and figure out, do they have an unfair advantage that they had more time? But I was very hopeful that the advice would resonate that way, because I put a lot of work into simplifying it and making it really easy to understand and follow. So I'm very pleased it has, but I was hopeful it would do so well.

Lenny (00:05:24):
Well, I will say sometimes they keep growing, so this isn't necessarily the terminal point for the post.

Ethan Evans (00:05:28):
The final position. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:30):
Okay. So for people that haven't read this post, or maybe for folks that have and maybe could use a refresher, let's spend a little time here. Could you just briefly describe this idea of The Magic Loop that you wrote about?

Ethan Evans (00:05:40):
Yeah, absolutely. So The Magic Loop is how to grow your career in almost any circumstance, even with a somewhat difficult manager. It does assume that you're working in some environment, normally as an entrepreneur or with a boss. But the basic idea of The Magic Loop is five steps and they're very easy.

(00:06:01):
The first one is you have to be doing your current job well. It's not possible to really grow your career if you're not considered at least performing at a solid level. Now, it doesn't mean you have to be the star on the team at this point, but what you can't have is your boss wishing that you were different. Like, "Ethan's not very good." So you have to talk to your manager and find out how you're doing and address any problems. So step one is do your job well.

(00:06:31):
Then step two is ask your boss how you can help. Speaking as a manager, and I've talked to hundreds of managers, very few people go and ask their manager, "What can I do to help you? What do you need?" And so just asking sets you apart, and it begins to build a relationship that we're on the same team, that I'm here as a part of your organization to make you successful, not just myself. 

(00:06:53):
Step three is whatever they say, do it. So you dig a big hole. If you say, "What could I do to help you?" And they say, "Well, we really need someone to take out the tray sheets day," and you're like, "Oh, I didn't mean that. I wanted exciting work. I don't want to do sort of this maintenance work or whatever." So do what they ask, help out even if it's not your favorite work. 

(00:07:14):
Once you've done that though, and maybe you do that a couple times, the fourth step is where the magic comes in. You go back to your manager and say, "Hey, I'm really enjoying working with you. I'm wondering is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?" And whether that goal is to change roles or get a raise or get a promotion, you say, "My goal is I'd really like to learn this new skill. Is there something you need that would also help me learn this new skill?" And the reason this works is managers help those who help them. It's just human nature. We all do that.

(00:07:52):
Generally, they're very open to meeting you halfway and saying, "Sure, I need this. We can rearrange it. We can find a way to meet your goals over time." Now for step four to work, you do have to know what is your goal, so you have to be clear on what it is you want. Well, that part's up to you. 

(00:08:15):
And then step five is the easiest step of all. It's just repeat. So like lather, rinse, repeat with your shampoo. Step five is once you're working with your manager towards your goal and discussing where you're going, and you're helping each other, the magic of the loop is just go around and around.

Lenny (00:08:31):
I was going to ask you, why is it that you call it The Magic Loop? Also, we kind of dived right in, but what is the goal of this? I guess it's pretty clear maybe at this point of this helps you advance in your career, but whatever you want to share along those lines.

Ethan Evans (00:08:43):
Yeah, okay. Very fair. So I called it The Magic Loop because I pioneered it with my audience a few years ago. And it works so well, that people were writing back in and saying, "How do I turn this off? I'm in over my head now. My boss has asked me to do all these cool things, and I feel like I can't catch up, and I've already been promoted once and I need time to digest it." And it just seemed like it worked like magic. It worked in almost every circumstance. 

(00:09:15):
There are of course exceptions where you have very exploitative managers who are like, "Oh, it's great. You're working harder, keep doing that, and they won't do anything for you." But those are rare. And then the purpose, yeah, to help you get satisfaction in your career. A lot of people are unhappy with their jobs. Many people want to move up a level or get paid more. Not everyone. Some people want to change what they're doing, they're bored. This is a path to all of that, because it's forming a partnership with your leadership to say, "Look, I'll help you, but I need you also to help me." And most good managers are very open to that.

Lenny (00:09:52):
When we were working on this, one of the pieces of feedback I had was I feel like I could just tell my manager, "Hey, I want to grow my career. What can we work on to help me get there?" And your feedback was like, most managers are not that good and not that thoughtful about their employee's careers. Can you just talk a little bit about that? People may be hearing this and be like, "Why do I need to do this? This seems like a lot of work."

Ethan Evans (00:10:15):
If you have a great manager, you may not need to do nearly as much formality. They may have given you good feedback, so you don't need to ask for feedback. They may have offered you opportunities to step up, and you've said yes to some and maybe no to others. That's fantastic. I designed The Magic Loop for the people who either don't know what to do or their manager is either not that good or just very busy.

(00:10:37):
Remember, lots of managers have great intentions to help their employees, but they get busy with their own lives, their own work, all the things they're focused on, even also their own career. The manager is often busy thinking about their own needs, and so they mean to get to you next week, and next week drifts on for a year.

Lenny (00:11:00):
What has come up since this has come out that you would want to either add to, or tweak, or help people better understand? I imagine there's some criticism. I imagine there's a lot of, "Yes, yes, yes. This really works."

Ethan Evans (00:11:12):
Two things I'd love to clarify. The first is many people ask me, "Why do I have to do this? Shouldn't my manager notice what I'm doing? Shouldn't my manager help with my career? Shouldn't my manager be planning for me?" And what I say about that is what your manager should do and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. 

(00:11:36):
The point of this loop is it's in your control. It is true that a good manager would do all those things I just mentioned, but not all managers are good and some of them need some help. And the thing I would just say about The Magic Loop is it's in your control.

(00:11:52):
And so you can be upset that your manager isn't perfect, but move on from that and take control of your own situation. That's the first thing I'd say. The other big extension I would make is look, if you are a manager or a leader of any type, you can initiate The Magic Loop from your side, so you can talk to your employees and say, "Hey, what are your career goals? Would you like to form a partnership where you step up to new challenges and I help you get to your goals?"

(00:12:26):
I had a lot of success forming this kind of partnership with my employees, where as they saw growth and success, they really leaned in and like, "This system works. You're actually investing in me now. I'll work extra hard." And I'm like, "Yes, and we can grow your team or grow your opportunity," and it was very win-win.

Lenny (00:12:46):
To give people a little bit of social proof, you mentioned some of the folks you've worked with on this. Can you share some stories, or stats, or anything to help people understand how helpful this ended up being to folks you've worked with?

Ethan Evans (00:12:58):
Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell one story from each end of the spectrum. And what I mean there is entry-level people and then high level executive leaders. I had an entry-level person write me back and say, "Look, when I learned about The Magic Loop, I was at a company and not doing very well. I started applying it. They offered me a $30,000 raise and a bigger job. And I turned it down because I got hired at this other company that was offering me even more, and I went there. And they've promoted me also," and he was one of the people who wrote in and said, his exact words were, "A year ago I was made redundant." So he is in the UK, redundant is their word for laid off. "A year ago I was made redundant. I got this first job and I got an offer for an increased salary, and then I got the second job and I got an increase when I joined that was even bigger." And he was in that situation of, "Mow I need to sort of slow down and digest all of that."

(00:14:05):
On the complete other end, one of my best people I ever worked with joined my team at Amazon as what we would call an SDE II, which in Amazon is a level five employee. He grew with me kind of following this process to a senior engineer. Then he switched to management and ran a small team. Then he became a senior manager and he relocated with my organization. He opened a new office in another city, was eventually promoted to director running his own office of a couple hundred people. And this was over the course of about eight years. He went from a mid-level engineer to an executive with a team of 800 people. Now he was a very hard worker, but over this eight years we just saw all this progress.

(00:14:56):
And then eventually he moved on. He founded his own startup, sold that, and now works as an executive vice president at one of the major online banks. And so his career in some sense has exceeded mine, but during that eight year span, he just grew so much. And this is the process we followed.

Lenny (00:15:19):
Wow, those are excellent examples. What levels does this help you with? At what level is this most useful, and then does it kind of taper out it? I don't know if you get to VP level, do you still try using Magic Loop?

Ethan Evans (00:15:33):
So I think it works anywhere from the start of your career to pretty far into it. I think at my level, I finished my career as a vice president at Amazon. It does peter out in the sense of the active. And what I mean by that is you're still doing the same thing, but you don't have to talk about it. Your managers are expecting you to step up and recognize challenges. They're expecting you to ask for resources when you need them, and you don't sort of have this level of explicit conversation around, what can I help you with? They're expecting you to anticipate what's needed.

(00:16:09):
So in the newsletter we did together, I wrote about how over time, you go from asking your manager, "How can I help?" To suggesting to your manager, "These are some things I see that seem like they need to be done. Would you like me to do them?" To just seeing what needs to be done and sort of keeping your leader in the loop and saying, "Hey, I noticed that we have this problem. I fixed it. I noticed we have this opportunity. I've started program against it." I think at the executive level, it's much more you being proactive and just keeping your leader in the loop.

Lenny (00:16:44):
I think in the post, the way you described this step is this is advanced mode. Don't jump straight to this. Don't just start suggesting things, because you may get it wrong.

Ethan Evans (00:16:53):
Yeah, well, it's all a matter of rapport and trust. A huge part of career success is how much trust you have, mutual respect with your leadership. When they're confident that you're going to make the right decisions, they're confident to let you go. But yeah, when you're brand new or you're new to a manager, if you just jump in, you may either not work on the things they value or even find yourself working across purposes, and that isn't the right place to start.

Lenny (00:17:19):
Awesome. Okay. Just to close out this conversation. You touched on this, but why is it that you think this is so important and effective? Why do you think this works so well? People may not recognize, "I see this is the key to this."

Ethan Evans (00:17:31):
Well, I think it's two things. First, I mentioned how rare it is for managers to be offered help. If you're a manager, you'll recognize this. If not, feel free to talk to any manager, whether your own or somebody else. Ask them how much they worry and how much they feel overwhelmed and wish someone would give them a hand. Management can be a lonely job, because you feel like you're responsible for everything. So having an ally, it's just a huge weight off people's shoulders.

(00:18:01):
And then I think a lot about social engineering. The social engineering's here is just the simple, "You help me, I'll help you." It doesn't have to be exploitative, it's just we help those people who help us, and that's built into human survival. 

(00:18:18):
And I think this loop works so well because it's just leaning a little bit into that behavior. So many relationships with managers are oppositional. You tell me what to do, and I'm kind of like a kid in high school who's trying to figure out how do I skip as many classes as possible and turn in as little homework and still get by with a D? That relationship won't build your career.

(00:18:45):
Some people approach their jobs as my goal is to do the least I can and still collect my paycheck. That's an approach if you're okay with where you are. It's not what I coach though. I assume people want to grow.

Lenny (00:19:02):
Okay, so maybe it's just as a closing question, for people that are listening and want to start putting this into practice slash are stuck in their career and are just like, "Okay, I see. Here's something I can do." Could you just again summarize the loop briefly?

Ethan Evans (00:19:15):
Sure. Step one, make sure you're doing your current job well. The way I explain this is when you go to your manager and ask, "What could I do to help?" You don't want their answer, even if they don't say it quite so bluntly to be, "Do your F-ing job." You need to be doing that already. So be doing a good job.

(00:19:34):
And unfortunately, a good job is in the eyes of your manager in this case. You may think I'm doing great work, but if your manager doesn't, they're the ones you need to build as an ally here. 

(00:19:46):
Once you have that, go ask how you can help, do whatever you're asked, and then go back to your manager and suggest or ask, "I would like to meet this goal. Can I keep helping you? What could I take on that you need that would also help me meet this goal?" And that's where you start to try to bring your two sets of aims together. What do you need done, how can I get to my goal? And let's do those things together.

(00:20:11):
And then you just repeat this loop. You build trust, you build the relationship. And with all good managers, and even a lot of moderate managers, they appreciate the help so much, they really lean into that.

Lenny (00:20:23):
I think there's two really important elements of this that you haven't even mentioned necessarily, that I think are part of the reason this works so well. One is this forces you and your manager to identify the gaps that are keeping you from the next level, which it's often vague, and then you get to a performance review, and then your manager's like, "Ethan, you're still not good on this and this and that," and you're like, "You never told me that that's the things you're looking for for me to get promoted." So I think there's this implicit, here's what you need to work on to get to the next level, which I think is part of step four. 

(00:20:53):
And then you actually did touch on this that it's important to share your goal to your manager. Here's what I want. I want to get promoted. A lot of times they don't know that and you helping them understand, "Here's what I want, help me get there." It goes a long way. So there's a lot-

Ethan Evans (00:21:06):
Managers often fall into the trap. They chose to become managers, so they assume one of two things about you. They either assume that you want to keep doing exactly what you're doing forever, just maybe make a little more money.

(00:21:16):
So you're an artist, you want to keep drawing forever. You're a lawyer, you want to keep writing contracts forever. Or they assume that, "Hey, I became a manager. I'm very proud of my career. That must be what you want."

(00:21:29):
And these assumptions are natural, right? We tend to view by default that our path is great and everyone would want to be us. Now of course, some good managers don't do that. But if you clarify and express your goals, you remove that ambiguity.

Lenny (00:21:45):
I actually had a period in my career where I specifically did not want to get promoted. I was very happy where I was, and I just wanted to keep doing this awesome IC role. Is that something at all you see where people are just like, "I'm good. I don't need to get promoted," and then is this helpful in that in any way or is it not as big a deal?

Ethan Evans (00:22:02):
So first, I reached a point in my career where I was no longer pursuing promotion either, and I wanted to do other things. So I've lived that myself and I've used the same loop, but I used it to go do what I wanted to say, "This is now what I want, and how do we get there? How do we create a role where I'm adding value appropriate to my level, but I'm doing this other work that's fun?" I moved into gaming and I really wanted to do that.

(00:22:25):
Second, I think it is still helpful because there's something you want probably. Maybe you want to work on different kinds of projects or maybe you want to work with a different higher performance team. Or maybe you want to rebalance your life and say, "Hey, I love what I'm doing, but how can I be a star performer for you but within these boundaries?"

(00:22:47):
So if you truly have the perfect job just as it is, you may not need The Magic Loop. But I know so few people if you're like, "Nope, there's absolutely nothing I could improve about my role."

Lenny (00:23:00):
Yeah, I think that your point about your goal doesn't have to be promotion. It could be work on a different part of the org, try something totally... Maybe transition to a new function that could be part of your goal. Awesome. 

(00:23:09):
Okay, so along the same lines of career progression, you work with a lot of senior manager types, kind of the level of L7 and one M2-ish, and you share with me that one of the most frustrating parts of their job in that specific portion of their career is they get stuck at that level and they don't move up, and it becomes really annoying, and they're not sure how to break out of that. What advice you share with folks like that, that may be listening?

Ethan Evans (00:23:36):
Yeah, so it's common to get stuck there, and there are a few reasons for it. First, there are a lot of senior managers. If you think of your average director, they may have six to eight reports. How many more directors are needed? So there's a choke point.

(00:23:52):
Second, that choke point is worse in the current economy, and in the past maybe a lot of companies, Amazon, Google, apple, etc., were growing very rapidly. And so it wasn't just you were waiting for some other director to leave. The teams were getting bigger.

(00:24:07):
I experienced this at Amazon, where over a nine-year period I went from managing six people to 800. And so I went from a senior manager all the way to a vice president, and I described I was, in some sense just riding the elevator. The elevator was going up, and as long as I managed to stay on it, I was going to arrive at vice president.

(00:24:29):
But the other thing that causes people to get stuck is the difference between a senior manager and a director is how you lead and the work you're doing. And you can get as far as senior manager by being really strong in your function and being really good at getting things done. As a director, and as a VP beyond that, it becomes much more about influence, coordination with others, and letting go of being in all the details yourself. And so senior managers really have to change some behavior.

(00:25:03):
I often reference the book by Marshall Goldsmith, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. Not only because it's a great book classically on this problem, but because the title tells the story. All the great traits that got you to this one level won't get you to the next level where you're more expected to be thinking in strategic terms, thinking longer term.

Lenny (00:25:26):
So to someone that may be in that role today and they're not moving up, is there anything they can do? This point about just there's no roles for you, there's only so much you can do there, is the advice just wait until an opportunity arrives? Is it run this Magic Loop until something happens? Is there anything you can do?

Ethan Evans (00:25:42):
I would be honest with people and say some patience is required. At this level, there is some notion of, do we need a director? Do we need a vice president? Do we have a challenge at that level that needs that person? And so promotions at this level, I often teach have two components. The first component is can I eat and do that job? Am I qualified? Do I have the skills? But the second piece is, do we have such a job that needs that?

(00:26:09):
However, there is a lot you can do. A lot is in your control. And what is in your control is to start practicing those next level skills. Start working with your leadership on, where can I take on a strategic project? How can I become more of an inventor? I teach some about how to sort of systematically be inventive. It's not pure magic. Edison said it's 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. You can learn the 99%, and the 1% isn't as hard then. So you start showing those next level traits. And as I describe it most succinctly, how do you make yourself the person who will be chosen out of the eight?

(00:26:51):
And you can be chosen, there are several ways to move up. Your boss can leave or be let go. They can be promoted to another role. But another way is I coach now, and I have several clients recently. I was just talking to a client yesterday, her two peers were let go. They were all the same level. Her two peers were let go and she was given their teams. And she expressed that her boss had been told, "You have too many senior managers for the size of your organization. We need to do some change in the organization, clean house, and put all your people under the folks who have potential."

(00:27:32):
Well, obviously she must be one of those people, because she still has her job and has more people and more to do. And unfortunately, her peers are shopping for new employment. So be that person, and that's where The Magic Loop comes in. Be that person.

Lenny (00:27:48):
I was just talking actually to a senior PM leader who pointed out that with this kind of lean environment of a lot of flattening of orgs and a lot of layoffs, that this is becoming increasingly hard. Exactly what you're describing. There's just less spots, because companies are running more lean, and so you just kind of have to wait. 

(00:28:06):
I think part of this advice you just shared, which is classic do the job before you have the job makes all the sense in the world. Because once people see that you can do it, obviously they'll feel a lot more comfortable putting you in that position.

Ethan Evans (00:28:18):
And they'll be looking. I always remind people, as a leader, I want the best people under me I can have. It's not that I don't wish to promote you. If you think about my job, this helps people, right? I have selfish motivation to promote you. A lot of people think, "The bosses there holding me down." Well, maybe some bosses are, but why wouldn't I want stronger, more capable direct reports? Why wouldn't I want people under me who can do more of my job? Frankly, that's the only way I can do less of my job.

Lenny (00:28:47):
Plus this pressure you're always getting from your reports. So like, "Hey, I'm ready to get promoted, because this time"... You mentioned this word inventiveness, and I was just listening to Jeff Bezos on Lex Fridman, and I don't know if you heard this, but Jeff Bezos described himself most as an inventor more than anything else that he does. Is that something that you think about? Is that influenced by Jeff Bezos any way, that idea of being an inventor as a leader?

Ethan Evans (00:29:13):
I'll say a couple things about that. First, I know you talked to my old boss, Bill Carr, who wrote Working Backwards. What I don't know is if he shared with you that after he published it, he actually realized there was a better title. He wishes that he had called the book The Invention Machine, because what Jeff was trying to do with Amazon was create the most inventive company, the company that would systematically out-invent others. And so while Working Backwards is a great title, Bill and Jeff think they should have called it the Invention Machine.

(00:29:47):
When I joined Amazon, I did not think of myself as an inventor, but I saw that we had these leadership principles think big and invent and simplify that pushed on that. And I said, "I'm in trouble. I don't know how to do this." And I sat down and thought about that. What am I going to do? It seems like that's required. And I figured out how to become systematically inventive. So I now hold over 70 patents as one benchmark of inventiveness, and they were all created during my 15 years at Amazon. 

(00:30:22):
And the way I did that, inventiveness actually isn't that hard. I teach about this. And to invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent. So Lenny, if you and I say let's get together and we're going to invent cancer drugs, we have the problem that neither of us, as far as I know is a biologist, a doctor. We don't have the right background, we don't know what we're doing. So we would just be fumbling around I guess with a bathtub full of chemicals hoping. It's probably not going to work out that well. So you have to be something of a knowledgeable expert.

(00:30:56):
But then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, "Invention is just going to come to me." When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent? And the most straightforward way to invent is not to somehow come up with something completely new, but instead to put together two things that exist. 

(00:31:28):
And so my example of this, I have a patent I talk about a lot for a drone delivery for Amazon, but the drone doesn't fly from the warehouse. Instead, a truck with no top drives slowly around the neighborhood, and the drones go back and forth from the truck. As opposed to the driver stopping at every house, you can have four or six drones hitting everything in the neighborhood. 

(00:31:55):
And the way I came up with this idea is one day I was thinking about drones and delivery, but I loved military history. And so I was thinking also about an aircraft carrier and I was thinking, is there a way to have an aircraft carrier for drones? And from that, it was very quick for the light bulb to go on and say, well, what about a truck? 

(00:32:17):
And so I have this patent, and we haven't seen this become reality yet. I'm waiting for my idea to become part of Amazon's drone delivery system, but I think ultimately it will.

Lenny (00:32:32):
That is badass. I'm imagining returns come back to the truck. We're using that rope thing that just captures them with that little hook.

Ethan Evans (00:32:42):
Yeah. Well, there's no reason... Same thing. When you want to return something as opposed to taking it to the UPS Store or whatever, you just put it on your porch, and then on your phone, on your app, maybe you take a picture of it so that the drone can recognize the box or you put it in a designated spot, and you push a button and the drone takes your return away. Yes, there's no reason.

Lenny (00:33:03):
Can't wait for that. And it takes your dog backs in it sometimes, part of it.

Ethan Evans (00:33:09):
My dog's too heavy, thank you.

Lenny (00:33:11):
My dog's not. There's an owl in our backyard that we sometimes worry he is going to come grab our dog on. This idea of invention, this is really interesting. I didn't plan to talk about this, but for someone like say a PM on a team that wants to get better at invention, innovation, big thinking, is there a practice you find helpful here? Is it block off two hours, get a pen and paper, and just think about the specific two adjacent things working together?

Ethan Evans (00:33:34):
So that's part of the process, is put in dedicated time. The interesting thing I would say is you don't need that much time. Two hours is great, but you only need two hours once a month. People think invention takes all this time. The thing is once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.

(00:33:52):
So you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, "Let's have Prime shipping." Well, Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle a decade's old idea now still getting better. 

(00:34:16):
So the point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive. Like Elon Musk, Tesla, he can kind of dust off his hands and be like, "I am now an Edison-like inventor." So he keeps doing it, but you don't need that many inventions.

Lenny (00:34:36):
This touches on something else Jeff Bezos shared on the podcast that most of his innovation and work is in the optimizing phase. It's not the here's the idea, it's the making it cheaper, and better, and faster. And that's where most of the good stuff comes from. In this point of Tesla, Elon had this idea, and now the hard work is actually making it scalable and cheap enough for people to use, not just an electric car.

Ethan Evans (00:34:59):
With the idea of Jeff saying that invention is really a lot of the incremental and optimization, I completely agree with that. To invent well, you need a base idea, but then there's so much of the work is making that idea real.

(00:35:15):
And again, Prime is a great example of this. The Amazon Prime program was a great example of, okay, we want fast free shipping. We want this program. That was a one-time idea that they did build, but now Prime has expanded. First it was two-day in the US, then one-day in the US, now it's same day in the US. But also they added Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Gaming. There's actually something like 25 things you get free with Prime. Most people have no idea, because you get free photo storage and this ongoing list. And all of that is that incremental optimization to make it better, better, better, better. And of course Jeff's goal, which you probably heard him say, was to make Prime a no-brainer, to where you would be irresponsible really not to be a member.

Lenny (00:36:06):
I know you have an awesome Jeff Bezos story that I want to get to, but before we do that, one more question along this line of career advice and progression. So I read somewhere that you've interviewed over 2,500 people over the course of your career. And so kind of going back to the beginning of a career, or at least getting a job, what have you found is most helpful in standing out as a candidate when you're interviewing, and essentially getting hired? What advice do you have for people that may be going through an interview process right now?

Ethan Evans (00:36:33):
There's a lot of evidence that suggests that the number one and two factors in any interview are appearance and enthusiasm. And it doesn't mean you have to be beautiful, but show up somewhere looking like you're interested in the job, not in your pajamas. And most importantly, be enthusiastic. People want to work with people that want to work with them. So if you seem very judgmental of the company and like you have to sell me on it, you're going to turn them off. I look at every interview of whether or not I really want this job, I might've decided I don't want the job. I still want the offer.

## Transcript

Ethan Evans (00:00:00):
People think invention takes all this time, but you only need two hours once a month. The thing is, once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.

(00:00:09):
So you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, "Let's have Prime shipping." Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle, a decades old idea now still getting better. The point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive.

Lenny (00:00:38):
Today my guest is Ethan Evans. Ethan is a former vice president at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator focused on helping leaders grow into executives. Ethan spent 15 years at Amazon, helped invent and run Prime Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce, which alone is a billion-dollar business for Amazon. He led global teams of over 800, helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles, holds over 70 patents, and currently spends his time executive coaching and running courses to help people advance in their career, build leadership skills, and succeed in senior roles.

(00:01:14):
In our conversation, Ethan shares an amazing story of when he failed on an important project for Jeff Bezos and what he learned from that experience. We spent some time on something called The Magic Loop, which is a very simple idea that I guarantee will help you get promoted and advance in your career. We also get into a bunch of other career advice, primarily for senior ICs, any managers. We get into advice for standing out in interviews, plus some of Amazon's most important and impactful leadership principles and much more. I learned a lot from Ethan and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Ethan Evans after a short word from our sponsors.

Ethan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ethan Evans (00:04:30):
Lenny, thank you a ton for having me. I'm super excited to talk about some of the things we have teed up today and to help people.

Lenny (00:04:37):
The first thing I thought we could chat about is The Magic Loop. So you wrote this guest post from my newsletter sometime earlier this year. It is, I don't know if you know this, but it's currently the sixth most popular post of all time on my newsletter across 300 plus posts. Did you expect this advice to resonate the way that it did, and why do you think it resonated as much as it did?

Ethan Evans (00:04:59):
So the competitive part of me really wants to analyze spots one to five and figure out, do they have an unfair advantage that they had more time? But I was very hopeful that the advice would resonate that way, because I put a lot of work into simplifying it and making it really easy to understand and follow. So I'm very pleased it has, but I was hopeful it would do so well.

Lenny (00:05:24):
Well, I will say sometimes they keep growing, so this isn't necessarily the terminal point for the post.

Ethan Evans (00:05:28):
The final position. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:30):
Okay. So for people that haven't read this post, or maybe for folks that have and maybe could use a refresher, let's spend a little time here. Could you just briefly describe this idea of The Magic Loop that you wrote about?

Ethan Evans (00:05:40):
Yeah, absolutely. So The Magic Loop is how to grow your career in almost any circumstance, even with a somewhat difficult manager. It does assume that you're working in some environment, normally as an entrepreneur or with a boss. But the basic idea of The Magic Loop is five steps and they're very easy.

(00:06:01):
The first one is you have to be doing your current job well. It's not possible to really grow your career if you're not considered at least performing at a solid level. Now, it doesn't mean you have to be the star on the team at this point, but what you can't have is your boss wishing that you were different. Like, "Ethan's not very good." So you have to talk to your manager and find out how you're doing and address any problems. So step one is do your job well.

(00:06:31):
Then step two is ask your boss how you can help. Speaking as a manager, and I've talked to hundreds of managers, very few people go and ask their manager, "What can I do to help you? What do you need?" And so just asking sets you apart, and it begins to build a relationship that we're on the same team, that I'm here as a part of your organization to make you successful, not just myself. 

(00:06:53):
Step three is whatever they say, do it. So you dig a big hole. If you say, "What could I do to help you?" And they say, "Well, we really need someone to take out the tray sheets day," and you're like, "Oh, I didn't mean that. I wanted exciting work. I don't want to do sort of this maintenance work or whatever." So do what they ask, help out even if it's not your favorite work. 

(00:07:14):
Once you've done that though, and maybe you do that a couple times, the fourth step is where the magic comes in. You go back to your manager and say, "Hey, I'm really enjoying working with you. I'm wondering is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?" And whether that goal is to change roles or get a raise or get a promotion, you say, "My goal is I'd really like to learn this new skill. Is there something you need that would also help me learn this new skill?" And the reason this works is managers help those who help them. It's just human nature. We all do that.

(00:07:52):
Generally, they're very open to meeting you halfway and saying, "Sure, I need this. We can rearrange it. We can find a way to meet your goals over time." Now for step four to work, you do have to know what is your goal, so you have to be clear on what it is you want. Well, that part's up to you. 

(00:08:15):
And then step five is the easiest step of all. It's just repeat. So like lather, rinse, repeat with your shampoo. Step five is once you're working with your manager towards your goal and discussing where you're going, and you're helping each other, the magic of the loop is just go around and around.

Lenny (00:08:31):
I was going to ask you, why is it that you call it The Magic Loop? Also, we kind of dived right in, but what is the goal of this? I guess it's pretty clear maybe at this point of this helps you advance in your career, but whatever you want to share along those lines.

Ethan Evans (00:08:43):
Yeah, okay. Very fair. So I called it The Magic Loop because I pioneered it with my audience a few years ago. And it works so well, that people were writing back in and saying, "How do I turn this off? I'm in over my head now. My boss has asked me to do all these cool things, and I feel like I can't catch up, and I've already been promoted once and I need time to digest it." And it just seemed like it worked like magic. It worked in almost every circumstance. 

(00:09:15):
There are of course exceptions where you have very exploitative managers who are like, "Oh, it's great. You're working harder, keep doing that, and they won't do anything for you." But those are rare. And then the purpose, yeah, to help you get satisfaction in your career. A lot of people are unhappy with their jobs. Many people want to move up a level or get paid more. Not everyone. Some people want to change what they're doing, they're bored. This is a path to all of that, because it's forming a partnership with your leadership to say, "Look, I'll help you, but I need you also to help me." And most good managers are very open to that.

Lenny (00:09:52):
When we were working on this, one of the pieces of feedback I had was I feel like I could just tell my manager, "Hey, I want to grow my career. What can we work on to help me get there?" And your feedback was like, most managers are not that good and not that thoughtful about their employee's careers. Can you just talk a little bit about that? People may be hearing this and be like, "Why do I need to do this? This seems like a lot of work."

Ethan Evans (00:10:15):
If you have a great manager, you may not need to do nearly as much formality. They may have given you good feedback, so you don't need to ask for feedback. They may have offered you opportunities to step up, and you've said yes to some and maybe no to others. That's fantastic. I designed The Magic Loop for the people who either don't know what to do or their manager is either not that good or just very busy.

(00:10:37):
Remember, lots of managers have great intentions to help their employees, but they get busy with their own lives, their own work, all the things they're focused on, even also their own career. The manager is often busy thinking about their own needs, and so they mean to get to you next week, and next week drifts on for a year.

Lenny (00:11:00):
What has come up since this has come out that you would want to either add to, or tweak, or help people better understand? I imagine there's some criticism. I imagine there's a lot of, "Yes, yes, yes. This really works."

Ethan Evans (00:11:12):
Two things I'd love to clarify. The first is many people ask me, "Why do I have to do this? Shouldn't my manager notice what I'm doing? Shouldn't my manager help with my career? Shouldn't my manager be planning for me?" And what I say about that is what your manager should do and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. 

(00:11:36):
The point of this loop is it's in your control. It is true that a good manager would do all those things I just mentioned, but not all managers are good and some of them need some help. And the thing I would just say about The Magic Loop is it's in your control.

(00:11:52):
And so you can be upset that your manager isn't perfect, but move on from that and take control of your own situation. That's the first thing I'd say. The other big extension I would make is look, if you are a manager or a leader of any type, you can initiate The Magic Loop from your side, so you can talk to your employees and say, "Hey, what are your career goals? Would you like to form a partnership where you step up to new challenges and I help you get to your goals?"

(00:12:26):
I had a lot of success forming this kind of partnership with my employees, where as they saw growth and success, they really leaned in and like, "This system works. You're actually investing in me now. I'll work extra hard." And I'm like, "Yes, and we can grow your team or grow your opportunity," and it was very win-win.

Lenny (00:12:46):
To give people a little bit of social proof, you mentioned some of the folks you've worked with on this. Can you share some stories, or stats, or anything to help people understand how helpful this ended up being to folks you've worked with?

Ethan Evans (00:12:58):
Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell one story from each end of the spectrum. And what I mean there is entry-level people and then high level executive leaders. I had an entry-level person write me back and say, "Look, when I learned about The Magic Loop, I was at a company and not doing very well. I started applying it. They offered me a $30,000 raise and a bigger job. And I turned it down because I got hired at this other company that was offering me even more, and I went there. And they've promoted me also," and he was one of the people who wrote in and said, his exact words were, "A year ago I was made redundant." So he is in the UK, redundant is their word for laid off. "A year ago I was made redundant. I got this first job and I got an offer for an increased salary, and then I got the second job and I got an increase when I joined that was even bigger." And he was in that situation of, "Mow I need to sort of slow down and digest all of that."

(00:14:05):
On the complete other end, one of my best people I ever worked with joined my team at Amazon as what we would call an SDE II, which in Amazon is a level five employee. He grew with me kind of following this process to a senior engineer. Then he switched to management and ran a small team. Then he became a senior manager and he relocated with my organization. He opened a new office in another city, was eventually promoted to director running his own office of a couple hundred people. And this was over the course of about eight years. He went from a mid-level engineer to an executive with a team of 800 people. Now he was a very hard worker, but over this eight years we just saw all this progress.

(00:14:56):
And then eventually he moved on. He founded his own startup, sold that, and now works as an executive vice president at one of the major online banks. And so his career in some sense has exceeded mine, but during that eight year span, he just grew so much. And this is the process we followed.

Lenny (00:15:19):
Wow, those are excellent examples. What levels does this help you with? At what level is this most useful, and then does it kind of taper out it? I don't know if you get to VP level, do you still try using Magic Loop?

Ethan Evans (00:15:33):
So I think it works anywhere from the start of your career to pretty far into it. I think at my level, I finished my career as a vice president at Amazon. It does peter out in the sense of the active. And what I mean by that is you're still doing the same thing, but you don't have to talk about it. Your managers are expecting you to step up and recognize challenges. They're expecting you to ask for resources when you need them, and you don't sort of have this level of explicit conversation around, what can I help you with? They're expecting you to anticipate what's needed.

(00:16:09):
So in the newsletter we did together, I wrote about how over time, you go from asking your manager, "How can I help?" To suggesting to your manager, "These are some things I see that seem like they need to be done. Would you like me to do them?" To just seeing what needs to be done and sort of keeping your leader in the loop and saying, "Hey, I noticed that we have this problem. I fixed it. I noticed we have this opportunity. I've started program against it." I think at the executive level, it's much more you being proactive and just keeping your leader in the loop.

Lenny (00:16:44):
I think in the post, the way you described this step is this is advanced mode. Don't jump straight to this. Don't just start suggesting things, because you may get it wrong.

Ethan Evans (00:16:53):
Yeah, well, it's all a matter of rapport and trust. A huge part of career success is how much trust you have, mutual respect with your leadership. When they're confident that you're going to make the right decisions, they're confident to let you go. But yeah, when you're brand new or you're new to a manager, if you just jump in, you may either not work on the things they value or even find yourself working across purposes, and that isn't the right place to start.

Lenny (00:17:19):
Awesome. Okay. Just to close out this conversation. You touched on this, but why is it that you think this is so important and effective? Why do you think this works so well? People may not recognize, "I see this is the key to this."

Ethan Evans (00:17:31):
Well, I think it's two things. First, I mentioned how rare it is for managers to be offered help. If you're a manager, you'll recognize this. If not, feel free to talk to any manager, whether your own or somebody else. Ask them how much they worry and how much they feel overwhelmed and wish someone would give them a hand. Management can be a lonely job, because you feel like you're responsible for everything. So having an ally, it's just a huge weight off people's shoulders.

(00:18:01):
And then I think a lot about social engineering. The social engineering's here is just the simple, "You help me, I'll help you." It doesn't have to be exploitative, it's just we help those people who help us, and that's built into human survival. 

(00:18:18):
And I think this loop works so well because it's just leaning a little bit into that behavior. So many relationships with managers are oppositional. You tell me what to do, and I'm kind of like a kid in high school who's trying to figure out how do I skip as many classes as possible and turn in as little homework and still get by with a D? That relationship won't build your career.

(00:18:45):
Some people approach their jobs as my goal is to do the least I can and still collect my paycheck. That's an approach if you're okay with where you are. It's not what I coach though. I assume people want to grow.

Lenny (00:19:02):
Okay, so maybe it's just as a closing question, for people that are listening and want to start putting this into practice slash are stuck in their career and are just like, "Okay, I see. Here's something I can do." Could you just again summarize the loop briefly?

Ethan Evans (00:19:15):
Sure. Step one, make sure you're doing your current job well. The way I explain this is when you go to your manager and ask, "What could I do to help?" You don't want their answer, even if they don't say it quite so bluntly to be, "Do your F-ing job." You need to be doing that already. So be doing a good job.

(00:19:34):
And unfortunately, a good job is in the eyes of your manager in this case. You may think I'm doing great work, but if your manager doesn't, they're the ones you need to build as an ally here. 

(00:19:46):
Once you have that, go ask how you can help, do whatever you're asked, and then go back to your manager and suggest or ask, "I would like to meet this goal. Can I keep helping you? What could I take on that you need that would also help me meet this goal?" And that's where you start to try to bring your two sets of aims together. What do you need done, how can I get to my goal? And let's do those things together.

(00:20:11):
And then you just repeat this loop. You build trust, you build the relationship. And with all good managers, and even a lot of moderate managers, they appreciate the help so much, they really lean into that.

Lenny (00:20:23):
I think there's two really important elements of this that you haven't even mentioned necessarily, that I think are part of the reason this works so well. One is this forces you and your manager to identify the gaps that are keeping you from the next level, which it's often vague, and then you get to a performance review, and then your manager's like, "Ethan, you're still not good on this and this and that," and you're like, "You never told me that that's the things you're looking for for me to get promoted." So I think there's this implicit, here's what you need to work on to get to the next level, which I think is part of step four. 

(00:20:53):
And then you actually did touch on this that it's important to share your goal to your manager. Here's what I want. I want to get promoted. A lot of times they don't know that and you helping them understand, "Here's what I want, help me get there." It goes a long way. So there's a lot-

Ethan Evans (00:21:06):
Managers often fall into the trap. They chose to become managers, so they assume one of two things about you. They either assume that you want to keep doing exactly what you're doing forever, just maybe make a little more money.

(00:21:16):
So you're an artist, you want to keep drawing forever. You're a lawyer, you want to keep writing contracts forever. Or they assume that, "Hey, I became a manager. I'm very proud of my career. That must be what you want."

(00:21:29):
And these assumptions are natural, right? We tend to view by default that our path is great and everyone would want to be us. Now of course, some good managers don't do that. But if you clarify and express your goals, you remove that ambiguity.

Lenny (00:21:45):
I actually had a period in my career where I specifically did not want to get promoted. I was very happy where I was, and I just wanted to keep doing this awesome IC role. Is that something at all you see where people are just like, "I'm good. I don't need to get promoted," and then is this helpful in that in any way or is it not as big a deal?

Ethan Evans (00:22:02):
So first, I reached a point in my career where I was no longer pursuing promotion either, and I wanted to do other things. So I've lived that myself and I've used the same loop, but I used it to go do what I wanted to say, "This is now what I want, and how do we get there? How do we create a role where I'm adding value appropriate to my level, but I'm doing this other work that's fun?" I moved into gaming and I really wanted to do that.

(00:22:25):
Second, I think it is still helpful because there's something you want probably. Maybe you want to work on different kinds of projects or maybe you want to work with a different higher performance team. Or maybe you want to rebalance your life and say, "Hey, I love what I'm doing, but how can I be a star performer for you but within these boundaries?"

(00:22:47):
So if you truly have the perfect job just as it is, you may not need The Magic Loop. But I know so few people if you're like, "Nope, there's absolutely nothing I could improve about my role."

Lenny (00:23:00):
Yeah, I think that your point about your goal doesn't have to be promotion. It could be work on a different part of the org, try something totally... Maybe transition to a new function that could be part of your goal. Awesome. 

(00:23:09):
Okay, so along the same lines of career progression, you work with a lot of senior manager types, kind of the level of L7 and one M2-ish, and you share with me that one of the most frustrating parts of their job in that specific portion of their career is they get stuck at that level and they don't move up, and it becomes really annoying, and they're not sure how to break out of that. What advice you share with folks like that, that may be listening?

Ethan Evans (00:23:36):
Yeah, so it's common to get stuck there, and there are a few reasons for it. First, there are a lot of senior managers. If you think of your average director, they may have six to eight reports. How many more directors are needed? So there's a choke point.

(00:23:52):
Second, that choke point is worse in the current economy, and in the past maybe a lot of companies, Amazon, Google, apple, etc., were growing very rapidly. And so it wasn't just you were waiting for some other director to leave. The teams were getting bigger.

(00:24:07):
I experienced this at Amazon, where over a nine-year period I went from managing six people to 800. And so I went from a senior manager all the way to a vice president, and I described I was, in some sense just riding the elevator. The elevator was going up, and as long as I managed to stay on it, I was going to arrive at vice president.

(00:24:29):
But the other thing that causes people to get stuck is the difference between a senior manager and a director is how you lead and the work you're doing. And you can get as far as senior manager by being really strong in your function and being really good at getting things done. As a director, and as a VP beyond that, it becomes much more about influence, coordination with others, and letting go of being in all the details yourself. And so senior managers really have to change some behavior.

(00:25:03):
I often reference the book by Marshall Goldsmith, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. Not only because it's a great book classically on this problem, but because the title tells the story. All the great traits that got you to this one level won't get you to the next level where you're more expected to be thinking in strategic terms, thinking longer term.

Lenny (00:25:26):
So to someone that may be in that role today and they're not moving up, is there anything they can do? This point about just there's no roles for you, there's only so much you can do there, is the advice just wait until an opportunity arrives? Is it run this Magic Loop until something happens? Is there anything you can do?

Ethan Evans (00:25:42):
I would be honest with people and say some patience is required. At this level, there is some notion of, do we need a director? Do we need a vice president? Do we have a challenge at that level that needs that person? And so promotions at this level, I often teach have two components. The first component is can I eat and do that job? Am I qualified? Do I have the skills? But the second piece is, do we have such a job that needs that?

(00:26:09):
However, there is a lot you can do. A lot is in your control. And what is in your control is to start practicing those next level skills. Start working with your leadership on, where can I take on a strategic project? How can I become more of an inventor? I teach some about how to sort of systematically be inventive. It's not pure magic. Edison said it's 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. You can learn the 99%, and the 1% isn't as hard then. So you start showing those next level traits. And as I describe it most succinctly, how do you make yourself the person who will be chosen out of the eight?

(00:26:51):
And you can be chosen, there are several ways to move up. Your boss can leave or be let go. They can be promoted to another role. But another way is I coach now, and I have several clients recently. I was just talking to a client yesterday, her two peers were let go. They were all the same level. Her two peers were let go and she was given their teams. And she expressed that her boss had been told, "You have too many senior managers for the size of your organization. We need to do some change in the organization, clean house, and put all your people under the folks who have potential."

(00:27:32):
Well, obviously she must be one of those people, because she still has her job and has more people and more to do. And unfortunately, her peers are shopping for new employment. So be that person, and that's where The Magic Loop comes in. Be that person.

Lenny (00:27:48):
I was just talking actually to a senior PM leader who pointed out that with this kind of lean environment of a lot of flattening of orgs and a lot of layoffs, that this is becoming increasingly hard. Exactly what you're describing. There's just less spots, because companies are running more lean, and so you just kind of have to wait. 

(00:28:06):
I think part of this advice you just shared, which is classic do the job before you have the job makes all the sense in the world. Because once people see that you can do it, obviously they'll feel a lot more comfortable putting you in that position.

Ethan Evans (00:28:18):
And they'll be looking. I always remind people, as a leader, I want the best people under me I can have. It's not that I don't wish to promote you. If you think about my job, this helps people, right? I have selfish motivation to promote you. A lot of people think, "The bosses there holding me down." Well, maybe some bosses are, but why wouldn't I want stronger, more capable direct reports? Why wouldn't I want people under me who can do more of my job? Frankly, that's the only way I can do less of my job.

Lenny (00:28:47):
Plus this pressure you're always getting from your reports. So like, "Hey, I'm ready to get promoted, because this time"... You mentioned this word inventiveness, and I was just listening to Jeff Bezos on Lex Fridman, and I don't know if you heard this, but Jeff Bezos described himself most as an inventor more than anything else that he does. Is that something that you think about? Is that influenced by Jeff Bezos any way, that idea of being an inventor as a leader?

Ethan Evans (00:29:13):
I'll say a couple things about that. First, I know you talked to my old boss, Bill Carr, who wrote Working Backwards. What I don't know is if he shared with you that after he published it, he actually realized there was a better title. He wishes that he had called the book The Invention Machine, because what Jeff was trying to do with Amazon was create the most inventive company, the company that would systematically out-invent others. And so while Working Backwards is a great title, Bill and Jeff think they should have called it the Invention Machine.

(00:29:47):
When I joined Amazon, I did not think of myself as an inventor, but I saw that we had these leadership principles think big and invent and simplify that pushed on that. And I said, "I'm in trouble. I don't know how to do this." And I sat down and thought about that. What am I going to do? It seems like that's required. And I figured out how to become systematically inventive. So I now hold over 70 patents as one benchmark of inventiveness, and they were all created during my 15 years at Amazon. 

(00:30:22):
And the way I did that, inventiveness actually isn't that hard. I teach about this. And to invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent. So Lenny, if you and I say let's get together and we're going to invent cancer drugs, we have the problem that neither of us, as far as I know is a biologist, a doctor. We don't have the right background, we don't know what we're doing. So we would just be fumbling around I guess with a bathtub full of chemicals hoping. It's probably not going to work out that well. So you have to be something of a knowledgeable expert.

(00:30:56):
But then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, "Invention is just going to come to me." When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent? And the most straightforward way to invent is not to somehow come up with something completely new, but instead to put together two things that exist. 

(00:31:28):
And so my example of this, I have a patent I talk about a lot for a drone delivery for Amazon, but the drone doesn't fly from the warehouse. Instead, a truck with no top drives slowly around the neighborhood, and the drones go back and forth from the truck. As opposed to the driver stopping at every house, you can have four or six drones hitting everything in the neighborhood. 

(00:31:55):
And the way I came up with this idea is one day I was thinking about drones and delivery, but I loved military history. And so I was thinking also about an aircraft carrier and I was thinking, is there a way to have an aircraft carrier for drones? And from that, it was very quick for the light bulb to go on and say, well, what about a truck? 

(00:32:17):
And so I have this patent, and we haven't seen this become reality yet. I'm waiting for my idea to become part of Amazon's drone delivery system, but I think ultimately it will.

Lenny (00:32:32):
That is badass. I'm imagining returns come back to the truck. We're using that rope thing that just captures them with that little hook.

Ethan Evans (00:32:42):
Yeah. Well, there's no reason... Same thing. When you want to return something as opposed to taking it to the UPS Store or whatever, you just put it on your porch, and then on your phone, on your app, maybe you take a picture of it so that the drone can recognize the box or you put it in a designated spot, and you push a button and the drone takes your return away. Yes, there's no reason.

Lenny (00:33:03):
Can't wait for that. And it takes your dog backs in it sometimes, part of it.

Ethan Evans (00:33:09):
My dog's too heavy, thank you.

Lenny (00:33:11):
My dog's not. There's an owl in our backyard that we sometimes worry he is going to come grab our dog on. This idea of invention, this is really interesting. I didn't plan to talk about this, but for someone like say a PM on a team that wants to get better at invention, innovation, big thinking, is there a practice you find helpful here? Is it block off two hours, get a pen and paper, and just think about the specific two adjacent things working together?

Ethan Evans (00:33:34):
So that's part of the process, is put in dedicated time. The interesting thing I would say is you don't need that much time. Two hours is great, but you only need two hours once a month. People think invention takes all this time. The thing is once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.

(00:33:52):
So you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, "Let's have Prime shipping." Well, Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle a decade's old idea now still getting better. 

(00:34:16):
So the point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive. Like Elon Musk, Tesla, he can kind of dust off his hands and be like, "I am now an Edison-like inventor." So he keeps doing it, but you don't need that many inventions.

Lenny (00:34:36):
This touches on something else Jeff Bezos shared on the podcast that most of his innovation and work is in the optimizing phase. It's not the here's the idea, it's the making it cheaper, and better, and faster. And that's where most of the good stuff comes from. In this point of Tesla, Elon had this idea, and now the hard work is actually making it scalable and cheap enough for people to use, not just an electric car.

Ethan Evans (00:34:59):
With the idea of Jeff saying that invention is really a lot of the incremental and optimization, I completely agree with that. To invent well, you need a base idea, but then there's so much of the work is making that idea real.

(00:35:15):
And again, Prime is a great example of this. The Amazon Prime program was a great example of, okay, we want fast free shipping. We want this program. That was a one-time idea that they did build, but now Prime has expanded. First it was two-day in the US, then one-day in the US, now it's same day in the US. But also they added Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Gaming. There's actually something like 25 things you get free with Prime. Most people have no idea, because you get free photo storage and this ongoing list. And all of that is that incremental optimization to make it better, better, better, better. And of course Jeff's goal, which you probably heard him say, was to make Prime a no-brainer, to where you would be irresponsible really not to be a member.

Lenny (00:36:06):
I know you have an awesome Jeff Bezos story that I want to get to, but before we do that, one more question along this line of career advice and progression. So I read somewhere that you've interviewed over 2,500 people over the course of your career. And so kind of going back to the beginning of a career, or at least getting a job, what have you found is most helpful in standing out as a candidate when you're interviewing, and essentially getting hired? What advice do you have for people that may be going through an interview process right now?

Ethan Evans (00:36:33):
There's a lot of evidence that suggests that the number one and two factors in any interview are appearance and enthusiasm. And it doesn't mean you have to be beautiful, but show up somewhere looking like you're interested in the job, not in your pajamas. And most importantly, be enthusiastic. People want to work with people that want to work with them. So if you seem very judgmental of the company and like you have to sell me on it, you're going to turn them off. I look at every interview of whether or not I really want this job, I might've decided I don't want the job. I still want the offer.

# The Godmother of AI on jobs, robots & why world models are next | Dr. Fei-Fei Li

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of people call you the godmother of AI. The work you did actually was the spark that brought us out of AI winter.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:07):
In the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
There's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress. There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:30):
It's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity, but I think every technology is a double-edged sword. If we're not doing the right thing as a society, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
You had this breakthrough insight of just, okay, we can train machines to think like humans, but it's just missing the data that humans have to learn as a child.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:01:03):
I chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We need to train machines with as much information as possible on images of objects, but objects are very, very difficult to learn. A single object can have infinite possibilities that is shown on an image. In order to train computers with tens and thousands of object concepts, you really need to show it millions of examples.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):
Today, my guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li, who's known as the godmother of AI. Fei-Fei has been responsible for and at the center of many of the biggest breakthroughs that sparked the AI revolution that we're currently living through. She spearheaded the creation of ImageNet, which was basically her realizing that AI needed a ton of clean-labeled data to get smarter, and that data set became the breakthrough that led to the current approach to building and scaling AI models. She was chief AI scientist at Google Cloud, which is where some of the biggest early technology breakthroughs emerged from. She was director at SAIL, Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab, where many of the biggest AI minds came out of. She's also co-creator of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, which is playing a vital role in a direction that AI is taking. She's also been on the board of Twitter. She was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in AI. She's also United Nations advisory board. I could go on.

(00:02:29):
In our conversation, Fei-Fei shares a brief history of how we got to today in the world of AI, including this mind-blowing reminder that 9 to 10 years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death knell for your brand because no one believed that AI was actually going to work. Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out. Fei-Fei is incredible and way too under the radar for the impact that she's had on the world, so I am really excited to have her on and to spread her wisdom with more people.

(00:03:22):
A huge thank you to Ben Horowitz and Condoleezza Rice for suggesting topics for this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. With that, I bring you Dr. Fei-Fei Li after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:03:37):
This episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I can involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.

(00:04:15):
Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code-back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny.

(00:04:40):
Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. Justworks knows that your employees are more than just your employees; they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa, and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally, to pay people on time and in their local currencies, and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with Justworks, it's super easy. Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally, Justworks offer simple software and 24/7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources right so that you can do right by your people. Justworks, for your people.

(00:05:31):
Fei-Fei, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:05:34):
I'm excited to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:36):
I'm even more excited to have you here. It is such a treat to get to chat with you. There's so much that I want to talk about. You've been at the center of this AI explosion that we're seeing right now for so long. We're going to talk about a bunch of the history that I think a lot of people don't even know about how this whole thing started, but let me first read a quote from Wired about you just so people get a sense, and in the intro I'll share all of the other epic things you've done. But I think this is a good way to just set context. "Fei-Fei is one of a tiny group of scientists, a group perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table, who are responsible for AI's recent remarkable advances."

(00:06:10):
A lot of people call you the godmother of AI, and unlike a lot of AI leaders, you're an AI optimist. You don't think AI is going to replace us. You don't think it's going to take all our jobs. You don't think it's going to kill us. So I thought it'd be fun to start there, just what's your perspective on how AI is going to impact humanity over time?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:06:30):
Yeah, okay, so Lenny, let me be very clear. I'm not a utopian, so it's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I'm a humanist. I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. So I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity. If you look at the long course of civilization, I think we are, and fundamentally, we're an innovative species that we... If you look at from written record thousands of years ago to now, humans just kept innovating ourselves and innovating our tools, and with that, we make lives better, we make work better, we build civilization, and I do believe AI is part of that. So that's where the optimism comes from. But I think every technology is a double-edged sword, and if we're not doing the right thing as a species, as a society, as communities, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:47):
There's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress, "There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people." I don't have a question there, but what a great line.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:07:59):
Yeah, I feel pretty deeply. I started working AI two and a half decades ago, and I've been having students for the past two decades and almost every student who graduates, I remind them when they graduate from my lab that your field is called artificial intelligence, but there's nothing artificial about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):
Coming back to the point you just made about how it's kind of up to us about where this all goes, what is it you think we need to get right? How do we set things on a path? I know this is a very difficult question to answer, but just what's your advice? What do you think we should be keeping in mind?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:36):
Yeah, how many hours do we have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
How do we align AI? There we go. Let's solve it.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:41):
So I think people should be responsible individuals no matter what we do. This is what we teach our children, and this is what we need to do as grownups as well. No matter which part of the AI development or AI deployment or AI application you are participating in, and most likely many of us, especially as technologists, we're in multiple points. We should act like responsible individuals and care about this. Actually, care a lot about this. I think everybody today should care about AI because it is going to impact your individual life. It is going to impact your community, it's going to impact the society and the future generation. And caring about it as a responsible person is the first, but also the most important step.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):
Okay, so let me actually take a step back and kind of go to the beginning of AI. Most people started hearing and caring about AI, as what it's called today, just like, I don't know, a few years ago when ChatGPT came out. Maybe it was like three years ago.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:51):
Three years ago, almost one more month, three years ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
Wow, okay. And that was ChatGPT coming out. Is that the milestone you have in mind?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:56):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):
Okay, cool. That's exactly how I saw it. But very few people know there was a long, long history of people working on, it was called machine learning back then and there's other terms, and now it's just everything's AI and there was kind of a long period of just a lot of people working on it. And then there's this what people refer to as the AI winter where people just gave up almost, most people did, and just, okay, this idea isn't going anywhere. And then the work you did actually was essentially the spark that brought us out of AI winter and is directly responsible for the world where now of just AI is all we talk about. As you just said, it's going to impact everything we do. So I thought it'd be really interesting to hear from you just the brief history of what the world was like before ImageNet and just the work you did to create ImageNet, why that was so important, and then just what happened after.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:10:44):
It is, for me, hard to keep in mind that AI is so new for everybody when I lived my entire professional life in AI. There's a part of me that is just, it's so satisfying to see a personal curiosity that I started barely out of teenagehood and now has become a transformative force of our civilization. It generally is a civilizational level technology. So that journey is about 30 years or 20 something, 20 plus years, and it's just very satisfying. So where did it all start? Well, I'm not even the first generation AI researcher. The first generation really date back to the '50s and '60s, and Alan Turing was ahead of his time in the '40s by asking, daring humanity with the question, "Is there thinking machines?" And of course he has a specific way of testing this concept of thinking machine, which is a conversational chatbot, which to his standard we now have a thinking machine.

(00:12:02):
But that was just a more anecdotal inspiration. The field really began in the '50s when computer scientists came together and look at how we can use computer programs and algorithms to build these programs that can do things that have been only capable by human cognition. And that was the beginning. And the founding fathers the Dartmouth workshop in the 1956, we have Professor John McCarthy who later came to Stanford who coined the term artificial intelligence. And between the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, it was the early days of AI exploration and we had logic systems, we had expert systems, we also had early exploration of neural network. And then it came to around the late '80s, the '90s, and the very beginning of the 21st century. That stretch about 20 years is actually the beginning of machine learning, is the marriage between computer programming and statistical learning.

(00:13:23):
And that marriage brought a very, very critical concept into AI, which is that purely rule-based program is not going to account for the vast amount of cognitive capabilities that we imagine computers can do. So we have to use machines to learn the patterns. Once the machines can learn the patterns, it has a hope to do more things. For example, if you give it three cats, the hope is not just for the machines to recognize these three cats. The hope is the machines can recognize the fourth cat, the fifth cat, the sixth cat, and all the other cats. And that's a learning ability that is fundamental to humans and remaining animals. And we, as a field, realized, "We need machine learning." So that was up till the beginning of the 21st century. I entered the field of AI literally in the year of 2000. That's when my PhD began at Caltech.

(00:14:33):
And so I was one of the first generation machine learning researchers and we were already studying this concept of machine learning, especially neural network. I remember that was one of my first courses at Caltech is called neural network, but it was very painful. It was still smack in the middle of the so-called AI winter, meaning the public didn't look at this too much. There wasn't that much funding, but there was also a lot of ideas flowing around. And I think two things happened to myself that brought my own career so close to the birth of modern AI is that I chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We can talk a little more later, but so much of our intelligence is built upon visual, perceptual, spatial understanding, not just language per se. I think they're complementary.

(00:15:37):
So I choose to look at visual intelligence and my PhD and my early professor years, my students and I are very committed to a north star problem, which is solving the problem of object recognition because it's a building block for the perceptual world, right? We go around the world interpreting reasoning and interacting with it more or less at the object level. We don't interact with the world at the molecular level. We don't interact with the world as... We sometimes do, but we rarely, for example, if you want to lift a teapot, you don't say, "Okay, the teapot is made of a hundred pieces of porcelain and let me work on this a hundred pieces." You look at this as one object and interact with it. So object is really important. So I was among the first researchers to identify this as a north star problem, but I think what happened is that as a student of AI and a researcher of AI, I was working on all kinds of mathematical models including neural network, including Bayesian network, including many, many models.

(00:16:53):
And there was one singular pain point is that these models don't have data to be trained on. And as a field, we were so focusing on these models, but it dawned on me that human learning as well as evolution is actually a big data learning process. Humans learn with so much experience constantly. In the evolution, if you look at time, animals evolve with just experiencing the world. So I think my students and I conjectured that a very critically-overlooked ingredient of bringing AI to life is big data. And then we began this ImageNet project in 2006, 2007. We were very ambitious. We want to get the entire internet's image data on objects. Now granted internet was a lot smaller than today, so I felt like that ambition was at least not too crazy. Now, it's totally delusional to think a couple of graduate student and a professor can do this.

(00:18:05):
And that's what we did. We curated very carefully, 15 million images on the internet, created a taxonomy of 22,000 concepts, borrowing other researchers' work like linguists work on WordNet, and it's a particular way of dictionarying words. And we combine that into ImageNet and we open-sourced that to the research community. We held an annual ImageNet challenge to encourage everybody to participate in this. We continue to do our own research, but 2012 was the moment that many people think was the beginning of the deep learning or birth of modern AI because a group of Toronto researchers led by Professor Geoff Hinton, participated in ImageNet Challenge, used ImageNet big data and two GPUs from NVIDIA and created successfully the first neural network algorithm that can...

(00:19:12):
It didn't totally solve, but made a huge progress towards solving the problem of object recognition. And that combination of the trio technology, big data, neural network, and GPU was kind of the golden recipe for modern AI. And then fast-forward, the public moment of AI, which is the ChatGPT moment, if you look at the ingredients of what brought ChatGPT to the world technically still use these three ingredients. Now, it's internet-scale data mostly texts is a much more complex neural network architecture than 2012, but it's still neural network and a lot more GPUs, but it's still GPUs. So these three ingredients are still at the core of modern AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
Incredible. I have never heard that full story before. I love that it was two GPUs was the first. I love that. And now it's, I don't know, hundreds of thousands, right, that are orders of magnitude more powerful.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:30):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):
And those two GPUs where they just bought, they were like gaming GPUs, they just went to the-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:34):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:35):
... GameStar that people use for playing games. As you said, this continues to be in a large way, the way models get smarter. Some of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, I've had them all mostly on the podcast, Mercor and Surge and Scale. They continue to do this for labs, just give them more and more label data of the things they're most excited and interested in.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:53):
Yeah, I remember Alex Wang from Scale very early days. I probably still has his emails when he was starting Scale. He was very kind. He keeps sending me emails about how image that inspired Scale. I was very pleased to see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):
One of my other favorite takeaways from what you just shared is just such an example of high agency and just doing things that's kind of a meme on Twitter. Just you can just do things. You're just like, okay, this is probably necessary to move AI. And it's called machine learning back then, right? Was that the term most people used?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:21:25):
I think it was interchangeably. It's true. I do remember the companies, the tech companies, I am not going to name names, but I was in a conversation in one of the early days, I think is in the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. And I remember I was actually encouraging everybody to use the word AI because to me that is one of the most audacious question humanity has ever asked in our quest for science and technology, and I feel very proud of this term. But yes, at the beginning some people were not sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):
What year was that roughly when AI was a dirty word?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:14):
2016, I think because that was-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:15):
2016, less than 10 years ago.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:18):
That was the changing. Some people start calling it AI, but I think if you look at the Silicon Valley tech companies, if you trace their marketing term, I think 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:40):
That's incredible. Just how the world has changed.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:43):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:43):
Now, you can't not call yourself an AI company.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:46):
I know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
Just nine-ish years later.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:49):
Oh, man. Okay. Is there anything else around the history, that early history that you think people don't know that you think is important before we chat about where you think things are going and the work that you're doing?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:23:01):
I think as all histories, I'm keenly aware that I am recognized for being part of the history, but there are so many heroes and so many researchers. We're talking about generations of researchers. In my own world, there are so many people who have inspired me, which I talked about in my book, but I do feel our culture, especially Silicon Valley, tends to assign achievements to a single person. While I think it has value, but it's just to be remembered. AI is a field of, at this point, 70 years old and we have gone through many generations. Nobody, no one could have gotten here by themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):
Okay, so let me ask you this question. It feels like we're always on this precipice of AGI, this kind of vague term people throw around, AGI is coming, it's going to take over everything. What's your take on how far you think we might be from AGI? Do you think we're going to get there on the current trajectory we're on? Do you think we need more breakthroughs? Do you think the current approach will get us there?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:24:13):
Yeah, this is a very interesting term, Lenny. I don't know if anyone has ever defined AGI. There are many different definitions, including some kind of superpower for machines all the way to machines can become economically viable agent in the society. In other words, making salaries to live. Is that the definition of AGI? As a scientist, I take science very seriously and I enter the field because I was inspired by this audacious question of, can machines think and do things in the way that humans can do? For me, that's always the north star of AI. And from that point of view, I don't know what's the difference between AI and AGI.

(00:25:10):
I think we've done very well in achieving parts of the goal, including conversational AI, but I don't think we have completely conquered all the goals of AI. And I think our founding fathers, Alan Turing, I wonder if Alan Turing is around today and you ask him to contrast AI versus AGI, he might just shrugged and said, "Well, I asked the same question back in 1940s," so I don't want to get onto a rabbit hole of defining AI versus AGI. I feel AGI is more a marketing term than a scientific term as a scientist than technologist. AI is my north star, is my field's north star, and I'm happy people call it whatever name they want to call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
So let me ask you maybe this way, like you described, there's kind of these components that from ImageNet and AlexNet took us to where we're today, GPUs essentially, data, label data, just like the algorithm of the model. There's also just the transformer feels like an important step in that trajectory. Do you feel like those are the same components that'll get us to, I don't know, 10 times smarter model, something that's like life-changing for the entire world? Or do you think we need more breakthroughs? I know we're going to talk about world models, which I think is a component of this, but is there anything else that you think is like, oh, this will plateau, or okay, this will take us just need more data, more compute, more GPUs?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:26:44):
Oh no, I definitely think we need more innovations. I think scaling loss of more data, more GPUs, and bigger current model architecture is there's still a lot to be done there, but I absolutely think we need to innovate more. There's not a single deeply scientific discipline in human history that has arrived at a place that says we're done, we're done innovating and AI is one of the, if not the youngest discipline in human civilization in terms of science and technology, we're still scratching the surface. For example, like I said, we're going to segue into world models. Today, you take a model and run it through a video of a couple of office rooms and ask the model to count the number of chairs. And this is something a toddler could do or maybe an elementary school kid could do, and AI could not do that, right?

(00:27:50):
So there's just so much AI today could not do, then let alone thinking about how did someone like Isaac Newton look at the movements of the celestial bodies and derive an equation or a set of equations that governs the movement of all bodies, that level of creativity, extrapolation, abstraction. We have no way of enabling AI to do that today. And then let's look at emotional intelligence. If you look at a student coming to a teacher's office and have a conversation about motivation, passion, what to learn, what's the problem that's really bothering you. That conversation, as powerful as today's conversational bots are, you don't get that level of emotional cognitive intelligence from today's AI. So there's a lot we can do better, and I do not believe we're done innovating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):
Demis had this really interesting interview recently from DeepMind slash Google where someone asked him just like, "What do you think, how far are we from AGI? What does it look like going through there?" He had a really interesting way of approaching it is if we were to give the most cutting-edge model all the information until the end of the 20th century, see if it could come up with all the breakthroughs Einstein had and so far we're nowhere near that, but they could just-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:22):
No, we're not. In fact, it's even worse. Let's give AI all the data including modern instruments data of celestial bodies, which Newton did not have, and give it to that and just ask AI to create the 17th century set of equations on the laws of bodily movements. Today's AI cannot do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:49):
All right. We're ways away is what I'm hearing.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):
Okay, so let's talk about world models. To me, this is just another really amazing example of you being ahead of where people end up. So you were way ahead on, okay, we just need a lot of clean data for AI and neural networks to learn. You've been talking about this idea of world models for a long time. You started a company to build, essentially there's language models. This is a different thing. This is a world model. We'll talk about what that is. And now, as I was preparing for this Elon's talking about world models, Jensen's talking about world models, I know Google's working on this stuff. You've been at this for a long time and you actually just launched something that's going, we're going to talk about right before this podcast airs. Talk about what is a world model? Why is it so important?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:30:33):
I'm very excited to see that more and more people are talking about world models like Elon, like Jensen. I have been thinking about really how to push AI forward all my life and the large language models that came out of the research world and then OpenAI and all this, for the past few years, were extremely inspiring even for a researcher like me. I remembered when GPT2 came out, and that was in, I think, late 2020. I was co-director, I still am, but I was at that time full-time co-director of Stanford's Human-Centered AI institute, and I remember it was... The public was not aware of the power of the large language model yet, but as researchers, we were seeing it, we're seeing the future, and I had pretty long conversations with my natural language processing colleagues like Percy Liang and Chris Manning. We were talking about how critical this technology is going to be and the Stanford AI Institute, Human-Centered AI Institute, HAI, was the first one to establish a full research center foundation model.

(00:31:59):
We were, Percy Liang, and many researchers led the first academic paper foundation model. So it was just very inspiring for me. Of course, I come from the world of visual intelligence and I was just thinking there's so much we can push forward beyond language because humans, humans use our sense of spatial intelligence, a world understanding to do so many things and they are beyond language. Think about a very chaotic first responder scene, whether it's fire or some traffic accident or some natural disaster. And if you immerse yourself in those scene and think about how people organize themselves to rescue people, to stop further disasters, to put down fires, a lot of that is movements is spontaneous understanding of objects, worlds, human situational awareness. Language is part of that, but a lot of those situations, language cannot get you to put down the fire.

(00:33:21):
So that is, what is that? I was thinking a lot. And in the meantime, I was doing a lot of robotics research and it dawned on me that the linchpin of connecting the additional intelligence, in addition to language embodied AI, which are robotics, connecting visual intelligence, is the sense of spatial intelligence about understanding the world. And that's when I think it was 2024, I gave a TED talk about spatial intelligence at world models. And I start formulating this idea back in 2022 based on my robotics and computer vision research. And then one thing that was really clear to me is that I really want to work with the brightest technologists and move as fast as possible to bring this technology to life. And that's when we founded this company called World Labs. And you can see the word world is in the title of our company because we believe so much in world modeling and spatial intelligence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):
People are so used to just chatbots and that's a large language model. A simple way to understand a world model is you basically describe a scene and it generates an infinitely explorable world. We'll link to the thing you launched, which we'll talk about, but just is that a simple way to understand it?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:34:56):
That's part of it, Lenny. I think a simple way to understand a world model is that this model can allow anyone to create any worlds in their mind's eye by prompting whether it's an image or a sentence. And also be able to interact in this world whether you are browsing and walking or picking objects up or changing things as well as to reason within this world, for example, if the person consuming, if the agent consuming this output of the world model is a robot, it should be able to plan its path and help to tidy the kitchen, for example. So world model is a foundation that you can use to reason, to interact, and to create worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:00):
Great. Yeah. So robots feels like that's potentially the next big focus for AI researchers and just the impact on the world. And what you're saying here is this is a key missing piece of making robots actually work in the real world, understanding how the world works.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:36:17):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I do think there's more than robots. That's exciting. But I agree with everything you just said. I think world modeling and spatial intelligence is a key missing piece of embodied AI. I also think let's not underestimate that humans are embodied agents and humans can be augmented by AI's intelligence. Just like today, humans are language animals, but we're very much augmented by AI helping us to do language tasks including software engineering. I think that we shouldn't underestimate or maybe we tend not to talk about how humans, as an embodied agents, can actually benefit so much from world models and spatial intelligence models as well as robots can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):
So the big unlocks here, robots, which a huge deal if this works out, imagine each of us has robots doing a bunch of stuff for us, they help us with disasters, things like that. Games obviously is a really cool example, just like infinitely playable games that you just invent out of your head. And then creativity feels like just like being fun, having fun, being creative, thinking of magic, wild new worlds, and environments.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:37:39):
And also design, humans design from machines to buildings to homes and also scientific discovery. There is so much. I like to use the example of the discovery of the structure of DNA. If you look at one of the most important piece in DNA's discovery history is the x-ray diffraction photo that was captured by Rosalind Franklin, and it was a flat 2D photo of a structure that it looks like a cross with diffractions. You can google those photos. But with that 2D flat photo, the humans, especially two important humans, James Watson and Francis Crick, in addition to their other information, was able to reason in 3D space and deduce a highly three-dimensional double helix structure of the DNA. And that structure cannot possibly be 2D. You cannot think in 2D and deduce that structure. You have to think in 3D spatial, use the human spatial intelligence. So I think even in scientific discovery, spatial intelligence or AI-assisted spatial intelligence is critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):
This is such an example of, I think it was Chris Dixon that had this line that the next big thing is going to start off feeling like a toy. When ChatGPT just came out, I remember Sam Altman just tweeted it as like, "Here's a cool thing we're playing with, check it out." Now, it's the fastest growing product to all of history, changed the world. And it's oftentimes the things that just look like, okay, this is cool, that it's a fun to play with that end up changing the world most.

This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including 8 of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new.

(00:40:16):
It's a more secure and branded experience. Plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters, US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

(00:40:45):
I reached out to Ben Horowitz, who loves what you're doing, a big fan of yours. They're investors I believe in...

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:40:51):
Yeah, we've known each other for many years, but yes, right now they're investors of World Labs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):
Amazing. Okay, so I asked him what I should ask you about and he suggested ask you why is the bitter lesson alone not likely to work for robots? So first of all, just explain what the bitter lesson was in the history of AI and then just why that won't get us to where we want to be with robots.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:41:17):
Well, first of all, there are many bitter lessons, but the bitter lessons everybody refers to is a paper written by Richard Sutton who won the Turing Award recently, and he does a lot of reinforcement learning. And Richard has said, if you look at the history, especially the algorithmic development of AI, it turns out simpler model with a ton of data always win at the end of the day instead of the more complex model with less data. I mean, that was actually... This paper came years after ImageNet. That to me was not bitter; it was a sweet lesson. That's why I built ImageNet because I believe that big data plays that role. So why can't bitter lesson work in robotics alone? Well, first of all, I think we need to give credit to where we are today. Robotics is very much in the early days of experimentation.

(00:42:25):
The research is not nearly as mature as say language models. So many people are still experimenting with different algorithms and some of those algorithms are driven by big data. So I do think big data will continue to play a role in robotics, but what is hard for robotics, there are a couple of things. One is that it's harder to get data. It's a lot harder to get data. You can say, well, there's web data. This is where the latest robotics research is using web videos. And I think web videos do play a role. But if you think about what made language model worth a very... As someone who does computer vision and spatial intelligence and robotics, I'm very jealous of my colleagues in language because they had this perfect setup where their training data are in words, eventually tokens, and then they produce a model that outputs words.

(00:43:36):
So you have this perfect alignment between what you hope to get, which we call objective function and what your training data looks like. But robotics is different. Even spatial intelligence is different. You hope to get actions out of robots, but your training data lacks actions in 3D worlds, and that's what robots have to do, right? Actions in 3D worlds. So you have to find different ways to fit a, what do they call, a square in a round hole, that what we have is tons of web videos. So then we have to start talking about adding supplementing data such as teleoperation data or synthetic data so that the robots are trained with this hypothesis of bitter lesson, which is large amount of data. I think there's still hope because even what we are doing in world modeling will really unlock a lot of this information for robots.

(00:44:53):
But I think we have to be careful because we're at the early days of this and bitter lesson is still to be tested because we haven't fully figured out the data for. Another part of the bitter lesson of robotics I think we should be so realistic about is again, compared to language models or even spatial models, robots are physical systems. So robots are closer to self-driving cars than a large language model. And that's very important to recognize. That means that in order for robots to work, we not only need brains, we also need the physical body. We also need application scenarios. If you look at the history of self-driving car, my colleague Sebastian Thrun took Stanford's car to win the first DARPA challenge in 2006 or 2005. It's 20 years since that prototype of a self-driving car being able to drive 130 miles in the Nevada desert to today's Waymo and on the street of San Francisco.

(00:46:17):
And we're not even done yet. There's still a lot. So that's a 20-year journey. And self-driving cars are much simpler robots, they're just metal boxes running on 2D surfaces, and the goal is not to touch anything. Robot is 3D things running in 3D world, and the goal is to touch things. So the journey is going to be, there's many aspects, elements, and of course one could say, well, the self-driving car, early algorithm were pre deep learning era. So deep learning is accelerating the brains. And I think that's true. That's why I'm in robotics, that's why I'm in spatial intelligence and I'm excited by it. But in the meantime, the car industry is very mature and productizing also involves the mature use cases, supply chains, the hardware. So I think it's a very interesting time to work in these problems. But it's true, Ben is right. We might still be subject to a number of bitter lessons.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):
Doing this work, do you ever just feel awe for the way the brain works and is able to do all of this for us? Just the complexity just to get a machine to just walk around and not hit things and fall, does just give you more respect for what we've already got?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:47:44):
Totally. We operate on about 20 watts. That's dimmer than any light bulb in the room I'm in right now. And yet we can do so much. So I think actually the more I work in AI, the more I respect humans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:03):
Let's talk about this product you just launched. It's called Marble, a very cute name. Talk about what this is, why this is important. I've been playing with it, it's incredible. We'll link to it for folks to check it out. What is Marble?

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:48:14):
Yeah, I'm very excited. So first of all, Marble is one of the first product that World Labs has rolled out. World Labs is a foundation frontier model company. We are founded by four co-founders who have deep technical history. My co-founders, Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall. We all come from the research field of AI, computer graphics, computer vision, and we believe that spatial intelligence and world modeling is as important, if not more, to language models and complementary to language models. So we wanted to seize this opportunity to create deep tech research lab that can connect the dots between frontier models with products. So Marble is an app that's built upon our frontier models. We've spent a year and plus building the world's first generative model that can output genuinely 3D worlds. That's a very, very hard problem.

(00:49:30):
And it was a very hard process and we have a team of incredible, founding team of incredible technologists from incredible teams. And then around just a month or two ago, we saw the first time that we can just prompt with a sentence and the image and multiple images and create worlds that we can just navigate in. If you put it on Google, which we have an option to let you do that, you can even walk around. Even though we've been building this for quite a while, it was still just awe-inspiring and we wanted to get into the hands of people who need it. And then we know that so many creators, designers, people who are thinking about robotic simulation, people who are thinking about different use cases of navigable interactable, immersive worlds game developers will find this useful. So we developed Marble as a first step. It's again, still very early, but it's the world's first model doing this, and it's the world's first product that allows people to just prompt, we call it prompt to worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:00):
Well, I've been playing around with it. It is insane. You could just have a little Shire world where you just infinitely walk around middle earth basically, and there's no one there yet, but it's insane. You just go anywhere. There's dystopian world. I'm just looking at all these examples and my favorite part, actually, I don't know if there's a feature or bug, you can see the dots of the world before it actually renders with all the textures. And I just love like, you get a glimpse into what is going on with this model, basically-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:51:27):
That is so cool to hear because this is where, as a researcher, I am learning because the dots that lead you into the world was an intentional feature visualization, is not part of the model. The model actually just generates the world. But we were trying to find a way to guide people into the world, and a number of engineers worked on different versions, but we converged on the dot, and so many people, you're not the only one, told us how delightful that experience is, and it was really satisfying for us to hear that this intentional visualization feature that's not just the big hardcore model actually has delighted our users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:19):
Wow. So you add that to make it more, like to have humans understand what's going on-

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:24):
To have fun, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):
... get more delightful. Wow, that is hilarious. It makes me think about LLMs and the way they, it's not the same thing, but they talk about what they're thinking and what they're doing.

Dr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:32):
Yes, it is. It is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):
It also makes me think about just the Matrix. It's exactly the Matrix experience. I don't know if that was your inspiration.

# Lessons from working with 600+ YC startups | Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator, Airbnb)

## Transcript

Gustaf Alströmer (00:00:00):
If I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is like it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Gustaf Alstromer. Gustaf is a group partner at Y Combinator where he's been for almost six years. Prior to that, Gustaf was at Airbnb for over four years where he started the original Airbnb growth team and where I was very lucky to get to work alongside him for a number of years. Gustaf is also at the heart of YC's increased focus on climate tech, and in my opinion is one of a handful of people who've had an incredible impact on the increasing amount of investment and people flowing into climate tech.

(00:01:10):
We chat in depth about what's happening in climate tech, why things have shifted so much recently, what's new and exciting, and how to think about the space if you're hoping to make the jump. We also get deep into Gustaf's experience working with over 600 startups over his time at YC. We talk about what are the most common mistakes that early stage startups and founders make, what advice YC partners give founders most often, the most common attributes of successful founders, the importance of having a technical co-founder and why that's the case, so much more. I guarantee you will leave this episode smarter and more inspired and I can't wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Gustaf Alstromer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:01:53):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you? What does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear is designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress, and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large established companies such as Vercel, Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:03:02):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools while trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at getepo.com. Get, E-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.

Gustaf, welcome to the podcast.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:04:17):
Thank you, Lenny. Honestly, it's so great to see you. I'm excited to be talking to you.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a while ever since we booked this. We worked together at Airbnb for many years. I was really lucky to get to work with you before you moved on to bigger and better things at YC. Speaking of Airbnb, you once tweeted about how special an experience that was for you, and I think even more interestingly, how many of the people that have left Airbnb can't find another place that's as special that just like that bar has been set too high. And so my first question is just like, what do you think it was that made Airbnb so special? Why was it such an important experience for you and other people? And even more importantly, just what is it that you take from that experience that you bring to startups that you work with now?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:02):
Yeah, it's funny. I think this year in a couple of months it'll be 10 years ago since you and me started Airbnb.

Lenny (00:05:07):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:08):
It was 2012. The reason I treated that was I asked everyone that I'd met after Airbnb, because I had this experience of like, this was the highlight of my career up until then, at least being in the team like that and I asked everyone, "Have you found anything better?" Besides maybe one or two people, I haven't heard anybody say that they found something better. And they all missed that dearly. I thought a lot about why that was the case, but I would say Airbnb did not feel like a normal job. It felt like more like a group of friends trying to just do something together and we were friends. At least in the beginning it did not feel like this was a job. It was sort of like an ongoing project and an assembly of amazing people. I think in the end we managed to build two things, like a really successful company, thanks to Joe and Nate and Brian just for starting this. Without them there would be nothing to build.

(00:06:04):
I think people don't like to use the word family, but I feel like that way because when I go and meet with Airbnb alumnis from that team. We have a very special bond that reminds me of close social connections more than anything else. It does not remind me of coworkers. I asked myself why this was the case. The best answer I have is probably we brought in a special type of people. We had very diverse backgrounds. A lot of us was former founders. Not many of us were career people from the technology industry of the early days, not many of us.

(00:06:37):
I think that bar that we set, the first, I believe when I joined there was probably five or seven PMs and there was 30 engineers or something and you joined a little bit before me, those people set the bar or set the standard of what we were looking for afterwards. I think it took a long time to change that narrative. I mean, eventually you have to hire people that only had big corporation careers, but I don't remember we did that for a long time. When I actually read my goodbye note recently, my words there still means a lot to me and it means sort of like you're trying to reflect on exactly these things on like, building a great company that became successful and being part of this sort of family of really close friends.

Lenny (00:07:21):
So it sounds like if you had to boil down what Airbnb did, it sounds like hiring was the main piece that impacted the way it turned out just like the founders being very specific about the type of people they were hiring.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Is there anything that's like, I don't know, a take away there of just what you recommend to founders, like hiring. People know, be very careful who you hire. The first, I don't know, 10 people will impact the culture long term. But I don't know. Is there anything just abstracting away there of just what to look for in that first batch of hires?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:50):
It's a tricky one because I would like to say that all the things that we did were the cost of the outcome of this, but that's not really how the world works. Some of the things we did work, some of the things that we did did not work. It's hard for us to actually disentangle what those things are, but I think we can talk about the things that we did. First of all, we made sure we hired people that were really excited to be there, right? They wanted to build Airbnb and they were really excited to work on Airbnb. That was the most important thing. Of course people had other offers, but I think you can figure out from those offers are you excited to be here or not. So that was probably the first thing.

(00:08:30):
The second thing I think is trying to understand the true motivations of the people that were there, like lower, "Why are you here?" We did something we call culture interviews that I think the founders have written about or there's probably content online about this. We did a lot of culture interviews early on to try to figure out we got the people that were there that mapped our core values and were really excited to work on Airbnb. I think finally, I don't know how this happened, we did pick people from diverse backgrounds. Most startups don't have most of the PMs being former founders, but I believe that was the case for the first 10 or 12 or 15 PMs at Airbnb. A lot of us were former founders. I think that that made a big difference for how you make decisions and how you get started on things.

(00:09:21):
I think I actually see this a lot in the Airbnb founders. They really care about the time at YC and they tried to recreate YC inside Airbnb a couple of times with demo day and with so new products completely isolated from the rest, starting with doing things that don't scale and talking to customers. So I think that that experience had made a big impact on them, but it's hard to say just these two things go and apply these things. It's actually kind of hard to say, "Well that will work at it as Airbnb." I think that's a really tricky question to answer.

(00:09:51):
The last thing I would say is Airbnb had an incredible business model, an incredible business from early on and it was hard to fail. What I mean by that is it's hard to fail with a company. You can fail with individual things inside the company, but a company was still going to succeed. I think we all felt that. A lot of companies don't have the ability to take risks like Airbnb did early on because they don't have something that's so obviously great.

Lenny (00:10:18):
That's a really interesting point on the last piece that you may have the most amazing culture and hire incredibly well, but if the company doesn't work out, it's not going to be looked back as like, "Wow, that was an amazing experience, but we failed."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:10:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:30):
Yeah, that's interesting. So you mentioned YC and this kind of is a good segue to where I want to focus most of our time. You mentioned that you've worked with over 600 companies at this point, which is absurd. It feels like it's you get some statistical significance on takeaways at this point of what works and doesn't work. So I have just a bunch of questions about your experience working at YC and with all these companies. The first is I think about this quote that Elad Gill tweeted once and he wrote, I think, a post about it. Elad Gill is a legendary angel investor. He said that starting a company is an act of desperation. You're either desperate to change the trajectory of your career or you're desperate to make a bunch of money, you're desperate to achieve some kind of mission or build a specific product that you're just like, "I need this to exist." I'm curious if you agree with that sentiment and then I have a follow-up question around that.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:11:20):
Yeah, actually I haven't heard it before, but you know me, I'm an optimistic person. I think it probably reflects on my view of this question, but I would say desperation sounds like a negative place that you're starting at. I actually think that most people to start companies start from a positive place. But the motivations, I agree with what he said, can be very diverse for successful founders, right?

(00:11:41):
So we actually asked this in one of the early Group Office Hours sessions. We asked them, "Why are you doing this?" And we don't want to hear an answer like, "I found this niche of the market.' That's not the why. The why is like, "Why will you come in and work late after four years when you have no money left and everything's going to shit?", right? Then the niche market is not the answer. There's something deeper than that. We've learned that it varies a lot for people's motivations to start companies. Some of them just want to solve some technical problem that they feel are passionate about solving. Some of them want to prove themselves in front of others or prove themselves towards themselves. Some have grand really important motivations to change the world and they will say things like, "I want to give everyone water or I want to solve climate change or I want to democratize publishing." You can imagine any number of large ideas. Some people just want to start a big company and just want to be successful.

(00:12:44):
It doesn't matter, in my experience, what your motivation is. I don't think either of these motivations. It sounds like some of them will be better than others. In my experience, it's not the case. The motivation will change over time to just running this thing, right? Like once something becomes big, it's hard to think every day about exactly why you got started because the motivation is just like it can be fun and work on boring things because it's fun to build something big. Everything doesn't have to be shiny and big and grandiose because there are many ideas that are "boring," but just the idea of running the company becomes the motivation eventually.

Lenny (00:13:17):
That is really interesting that one of the main things you look for, it sounds like when you're interviewing, is how strong and durable is that drive to build this company. Is that what you're saying?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:13:26):
It's actually kind of hard for screen for motivation, I would say, in interviews because the purpose of this kind of Office Hour question is to highlight why someone is there and highlight the diversity of reasons people are there and sometimes even highlight from one founder to another co-founder why they are doing this. They might have never talked about this. Actually, surprisingly, often founders have not talked about why they're doing this. And just knowing why someone is here really helps with conflict resolution for example, really helps with understanding why someone is there on a certain day or something like that. So it's not something we screen for as much as I think we try to help founders discover this among themself and really know this about themself. I've just accepted that the motivations to start companies is widely diverse.

Lenny (00:14:13):
Do you ever discourage founders from starting a company when you see that maybe it won't be a durable kind of lasting motivation or whatever other reasons just knowing how hard starting a company ends up being?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:14:23):
It's a good question. I would say sometimes if someone doesn't have a motivation or don't know why they're doing this, they're doing this because they read that it would be a natural career step. So a good reason to not start a company is if you think of starting a company as a career step. Well, it is not. Because if it's successful, it'll be your entire career. It'll be 10 years most likely. And if it's not successful, then it's not something that people generally aspire to start. So non-successful startups. So I think people will start companies because this is sort of something they want to put on their resume. They have not understood what startups are or why you should do them.

(00:14:58):
Sometimes you can screen and kind of figure this out, but sometimes people don't even know why they're starting a company when they get started and it kind of gets figured out along the way. And that's okay. I don't want to discourage people who don't know exactly why they're starting this company just to start a company. They might figure out along the way and find the true motivation after doing this for a little bit or finding that it's really fun.

(00:15:21):
I think I discourage people to start startups if they have so many other things that are important than their life that are more important than the startup. So if there are financial constraints or family constraints or relationship constraints and they are going to trump this, then yeah, you should think a second time perhaps because startups are hard. They're much harder than a normal job. Equally hard if they're successful or failure, right? There's no middle way, we're like, "Oh, my company is doing great so I can chill." That doesn't work that way either. So I don't really discourage or encourage people, I just want them to have all the information.

Lenny (00:16:03):
You mentioned YC Office Hours and I had a question around this. I'm working on this piece where I'm interviewing a bunch of B2B founders of companies that are doing super well and I asked them a few questions like, "How'd you come up with the idea? How'd you find your first few customers?" it's shocking how many of them bring up a conversation in YC Office Hours as the most pivotal point that set them on the trajectory that they're on now. I'm curious what happens in these Office Hours? What are the most common pieces of advice that you give or maybe most surprising pieces of advice that you give in these Office Hours so that people can get maybe a glimpse into these conversations you have?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:16:43):
So at YC we have two type of Office Hours, two of the common ones. We have regular Office Hours, which is usually a one-on-one or basically the founders talking to me, or me plus another partner. They happen every week or every other week throughout the entire program. And they happen years after the program on the regular basis. Then we have Group Office Hours, which is you and six or seven other startups talking to us. They have [inaudible 00:17:07] a little bit different purpose. So the goal of the regular Office Hour, I always ask the question, "What's holding you back from moving faster? We don't want to hear updates, we don't want to hear strategy questions. We want to understand what's slowing you down or what's holding you back from moving even faster. You generally have a specific goal."

(00:17:27):
And I think that question of what's slowing you down or were holding you back crystallizes the priorities. There are only so many things you can do as a startup and there are only so many things that matters at that stage. And by asking that question, we can start digging into, "Okay, what's the goal? What are the things that drives towards that goal? What are the things that's slowing you down towards that goal?" Usually, the founders don't know what's slowing it down, so the conversation and us probing questions actually leads to us or them discovering what it is just slowing them down.

(00:17:59):
In the Group Office Hour, it's a little bit different. The Group Office Hour holds a couple of different purposes. One of them is if I think back on Paul and Jessica's motivation to start YC, this is a surprise to them, but starting a company is incredibly lonely. You can't really lean on your employees and say, "Hey, I'm feeling really shitty as a founder today. Everything is going to shit." Employees isn't going to take that well. So you lean on perhaps your investors, but they're not really available. But what you can lean on is other founders because they're all in the same situation. It's sort of like when you ask a founder the question, "How are things going?", it's so emotional for them to answer that question because it's never going well, right? It's never like, "Oh, everything is going fantastic." They might say that, but everybody knows all founders, when they look each other's eyes, then no, that's not the answer.

(00:18:48):
So founders have infinite number of problems that they're thinking about all the time, which is why they're allergic to the question, "How are things going?" But when YC started, we put all the founders in a group together in a room and they started learning that all founders, all companies are broken in some way, right? They're all having these massive problems and they're all feeling that anxiety when they hear the question, "How are things going?" And just hearing other founders explain their problems, perhaps solving their problems, is a really good way for yourself to both feel motivated to do it yourself and see how problems get solved when other companies are having similar problems. Nowadays because of the scale at YC, we group companies together that have the same problems or the same area that they're operating in.

(00:19:30):
The second thing that Group Office Hours do well is accountability, right? We ask you, "What were your goals? What were your goals for the last two weeks? Did you hit them?" And then that gives founders accountability because founders are competitive. They don't want to look bad. They don't want to come back after two weeks and say "Nothing worked," or at least like, "We didn't learn anything." They want to learn something and make progress whether it's positive or negative.

(00:19:54):
Group Office Hours to me is the most magical moment because it really creates this very intense three or four month period. Founders often come back to us afterwards and say, "Hey, we want to do that again. We don't have this really intense, really productive period. We don't have a program exactly. We have other programs, but we don't have anything exactly that mimics that experience." But we do encourage founders to continue with Group Office Hours after YC. Many of them do and many of them, ad hoc, continue to meet for years in this group setting where they ask the same kind of questions to each other, to hold themselves accountable, to learn from each other, and to just have someone else to lean on. I think this was unknown and somehow the world didn't know before that starting company is super lonely and you have all these anxiety. By just talking to other people who have the same problems, it's just one of the best thing you can do.

Lenny (00:20:45):
There's so many things that come up when you talk about this. One is I had a startup at one point and we worked in the coworking space. We joined the coworking space because we're like, "Oh, we'll meet other founders. It'll be social, we won't be alone." But it turns out everyone's just heads down, headphones on, "I don't have time for anything. I just need to work." It's like a microcosm of that experience that even if you're surrounded by founders, no one has time to do anything. They're just working.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:09):
You got to schedule it and force it and put the laptops on the floor and the phones on the floor and you just sit there with pen and paper. That's how you have to do it. We tried to mimic that as much as we could over Zoom. But honestly the best experience of this was in person, in a ring, in mountain view with no computers and everyone just paying attention to everyone. That was the best experience. Yeah, that's what I remember is one of the most meaningful parts of YC. I didn't have it myself when I did YC, but now everyone has it.

Lenny (00:21:36):
The other thing that's made me think about is someone tweeted once, "Don't ever ask a founder how they're doing or how it's going. It just creates all this anxiety because nothing's ever going great."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:44):
Don't do it. Everybody looks at each other's eyes and they know that they're allergic to that question.

Lenny (00:21:50):
That's hilarious. So just to summarize the questions you said you asked, the one is in the individual Office Hours, is what's holding you back. And then in the group setting, what was the question again that you asked?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:01):
What are your goals for next two weeks and what were your goals for the last two weeks and did you hit the goals? And if you didn't hit them, what came in the way of hitting the goals? It's very simple. That can uncover lots of problems that other founders are having exactly in the same way. Just by talking about the things that held you back or the things that allowed you to hit your goals, uncover something material for the other seven companies doing that in the ring.

Lenny (00:22:26):
If you kind of zoomed out a little bit and thought about the startups you've worked with, what would you say are the most common mistakes that early stage startups make broadly?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:36):
There's so many. I mean, this is how I initially learned about startups, by searching for that on Google and landing on Paul Graham's articles because he kept-

Lenny (00:22:45):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:45):
I think I've written many articles about this topic because it is so common. So this topic can go on forever. But if I take the most recent experience I've had in YC, I would say startups fail, one, because they don't talk to customers. And if you don't talk to customers or users, you don't actually know what's important. If you don't know what's important, it doesn't matter what you build, it doesn't matter kind of what ideas you have in your head if you don't actually know what it is that you need to build and you don't validate with customers. That's where a lot of the failure stems from. A lot of early YC for us or early part of the program is us pushing and probing founders to be like, "Tell us about the conversations you've had with the customers. What did you learn? Can you show us the organizations?" Or like all these questions, like, "What are the software they're using? What are they paying for? What problems do they have? How are they describing the intensity of that problem?" So that's what we spent a lot of time early at YC.

(00:23:43):
After that, I would say one of the commons mistakes in... I'm not talking about generally startups here, I'm talking inside YC. The second most common thing I see in YC is people are just afraid to talk to customers. They're just not trying hard enough to get in front of customers. I think this comes from, technical people tend to think that software is just sort of solution to everything. But really what you should need to do is to talk to someone over Zoom or over phone or in person, even better. People are just afraid of doing that and they're afraid of being rejected. These are common, people that want to build good products are just really afraid of people saying no.

(00:24:25):
The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters. It doesn't matter if you have something new and cool, they're just not interested. They are not incentivized to take risks in their job to try something new. They're just incentivized to not take risks and just continue what they're doing. Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're The ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have to reach 10 to find one. And then you convince that one person to get on the phone or a video call with you. And that takes work and it takes a lot of work. I think people don't really think of this. This is common knowledge, basic stuff for salespeople, but founders should never done sales before just get surprised by the percentages and the sort of what it means to do this.

(00:25:12):
If I think of more generally outside of YC, so these are two kind of things I experience within YC, but I think generally outside of YC, I would say the two most common problems the same one is not talking to customers, the other one is not being technical and not knowing what it takes to build successful technology company. It means having technical founders and it means being able to build the first prototype. This is something we screen for when we interview people in YC and we aren't accepting a whole lot of team that don't know how to build or get their first prototype built themselves because we know it is a super common value pattern.

(00:25:50):
I can go on and on and on and on for this one, but honestly if I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:26:23):
This is really interesting and good advice. It's interesting that... Like, "Talk to customers," people hear that all the time. They're like, "Of course we're going to talk to customers. We're going to do that of course." And your experience is they know this but they just don't do it probably because they're afraid. Maybe also because they think they already know what they need to build and it's like, "Yeah, we're good."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:26:41):
And you have all these validators, right? So the people are validating that even if you don't talk to customers, why has he accepted you? This investor invested in you. This investor said you were great, like blah blah blah. All these different validations that you confuse with product market fit, right? We have to remind everyone on the first day in YC, "None of you have product market fit because you probably don't," right? Almost nobody has. Because people confuse this external validation with the thing that matters the most, which is talking to customers and learning what matters. It's just like a thing that just keeps coming back. Some get really good at it. And that is the source of successful startups, is when you really get good at this.

Lenny (00:27:21):
It reminds me coming back to Airbnb, one of the most important moments in Airbnb history was Paul Graham telling the founders of Airbnb, "Where are your customers?" And they're like, "Oh, they're in New York" and he's like, "Why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?" And they talk about that all the time.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:27:35):
Yeah, it's absolutely true. I think he wrote the article Do Things That Don't Scale as a learning.... The learning there was the Airbnb founders doing the trips to New York and learning about how to build Airbnb, which is a very counterintuitive idea, which is when you have to spend the most amount of time with your customers. I think Airbnb is sort of one of the best stories inside YC of doing this well.

Lenny (00:27:57):
This also reminds me, I've been talking to a bunch of founders recently. I asked them, "How many customers have you talked to help figure out this idea?" So just the other day it was 150 financial CROs that they talked to before they actually started raising this round. Another company, actually two Airbnb guys that started, they actually ran ads I think on LinkedIn to find specific people to talk to and that specific role. And they talked to probably at least 100, maybe 200. So there's a strong correlation there.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:26):
Yeah, I think that's the volumes that people don't expect. They think they might have to talk to five, but I think you have to talk to 25 to 50. That means you have to reach out to a lot more to be able to get to people that are potentially early adopters. Those ones you talk to are also the ones that become your customers. So you are already doing most of the sales by just doing this work anyway.

Lenny (00:28:45):
Do you have maybe one tactical tip you could share of just either getting over your fear of talking to customers or just holding yourself accountable to actually doing it?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:55):
Yeah, I tell this story, I actually told this story yesterday. So remember when you sign up first service that's a cool service and you hear about in TechCrunch or something like that and then you realize you already signed up a year ago, right? And then from the founder's perspective, you sign up to something you never used it. So the founders who build those services, their inclination to think is that "Everybody hates me because they sign up and they never use me." They never use the service. The fear of that is that basically the fear of rejection. So if I put my thing out there and most people won't use it and they will tell all their friends how shitty this thing is, you should never even sign up for it, that's the fear people have, but the truth is that people sign up for it and be like, "Oh, I'm busy. I got something else to do." And they actually don't remember or care.

(00:29:43):
So whenever you sign for something that you signed up a year ago, think of yourself that that is the common customer experience, which is that you just sign up for a lot of stuff you don't even remember you. You never have this, "I hate this thing' reaction. You always have this like, "I'm indifferent to this thing. I don't actually care to even complete the sign up flow or try it out," right? I think that's the thing that people need to remember, is that the worst thing that can happen to startup is not that people hate what you're doing, it's that they're completely indifferent to what you're doing. It's not the worst thing, but the most common thing that happens is people just is indifferent. But it doesn't give you a second chance. Let's say, it always gives you a second chance and you really need to internalize that people have busy lives and if people don't actually use what you're building, that's fine. You can reach out to them a year from now or six months from now or two weeks from now and they probably will if you make some improvements.

(00:30:37):
I think people just have this fear that, "If I get a lot of rejection, that means everything is bad." But the rejection should be put in context to the early adopter idea and that most people who don't care are not early adopters, who don't want to dig into new things. And that the more narrow of a solution you have to a specific problem, the fewer people actually want to dig in. But that's where you have to start because you cannot build the whole thing right up front and make everybody loves you. That doesn't really work that way.

(00:31:07):
Even Airbnb was like air mattresses or staying in someone's homes when they're home. That was not the complete solution of Airbnb. But there were early adopters who dug in and be like, "Yep, I like that. I like those two things. I want to have people stay in my living room in my mattress." But that's not what Airbnb is about today, and a lot of those things were unknown at the time. But I think people are just afraid of rejection and you just need to overcome that fear and just learn that there's nothing that's really that bad that can happen when people don't use the service or sign up and don't care. It's not really that bad.

Lenny (00:31:42):
It reminds me of a quote that I always love for Mark Andreessen, that everyone's time is already allocated. They don't have space for your product right now. They already have plans for their day.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:31:42):
Totally.

Lenny (00:31:51):
And it takes a lot to convince someone to pay attention to anything. I guess that just comes back to why it's so important that your product is solving a real pain and not just a nice little toy that is better than what's out there, but not so much better that you're like, "I need this right now." So maybe just along those lines, do you have any thoughts on just the importance of that pain and just how critical that is?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:32:15):
I actually recorded... I'm happy of these videos, but I've recorded two videos on YouTube as part of YC Startup School last fall. You can go watch them on YouTube right now. One of them is how to talk to users and the other one is how you sell or how you use sales. The one about talking to users, I think there's a difference in asking someone, "Do you have a problem with X, Y, Z? Is this podcasting setup working for you?" And people say, "Yeah, it's kind of working." But if you are a podcasting setup experts and you watch people use some other thing that's really shitty, they might also think that it's pretty good. But you have to watch them do it. And the best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them or to watch them solve the thing that they do.

(00:33:06):
You know how a lot of non-technical people don't know how to automate things? So they will do the same thing in Excel like a million times by just tapping because that's the only thing that they know and they're not technical enough to write some kind of script to do it, and you just have to watch those people to just feel the pain. You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, y, z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them. So the best thing I've learned about how to discover the pain is to watch people, have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow about the area where you're doing some discovery. That is the best thing.

(00:33:43):
I'll give you another example. So there's a bunch of waste companies that are doing EV charging for electric cars and they're like, "What are the problems in EV charging?" And I was like, "Just rent an EV and go and charge at all the non Tesla chargers and see what they say, see what you experience." And the truth is that it's just like garbage. A lot of EV charting systems are just so shitty and the apps are terrible. You just have to just use them yourself to know how bad it is.

Lenny (00:34:13):
It's cool how often it just comes back to, "Just go do the thing. Do things that don't scale." Classic YC advice. I want to come back to something you mentioned that I want to pull a thread on as the technical co-founder, being technical early on, just to cover that. So I know YC looks to... Having a technical founder is an important variable in you're deciding to accept a company. Say someone doesn't have a technical co-founder, do you have any advice for what they could do, like what often can work?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:34:41):
Yeah, I think the first thing is to understand the value of technical co-founder. So some people who are in this situation where they have an idea of something they want to build and they don't have anyone to help build them in building it, I had a friend Paul who gave this incredible quote, he said, "I have an idea for a song, I just need a musician to help me make it," right? That's kind of similar to how it is with engineering. If you view output of engineering as like, "I just have an idea for a song, I just need someone to actually make it for me" and then you're not valuing software engineering or mechanical engineering or any engineering skill set deep enough, right?

(00:35:17):
The truth is that the engineering part is the really hard part. The first thing I would say is you need to learn how to value the engineering piece. Let me give you an example of how you don't do that. You applied to YC and you have 90% for yourself and 10% for the engineer. You're basically saying that like, "Oh, the engineering part of this company is only worth 1/10th of me. I'm the non-technical person." So that to me is a signal that you're not really valuing engineering.

(00:35:44):
Okay, so how do you go out about and find someone? Well, the truth is that there are a lot of technical co-founders. The technical people, they also want to find business co-founders. They don't want to do other part. They don't want to do sales and they actually don't really care that much about fundraising. They just want to solve the problem. And that's fine. We built something called co-founder matching where those funders can meet, but if you don't participate in that, you can just start by asking the best technical people that you know. "Are you interested in starting a company with me?" Same thing with rejection. Many of them will just say, "No, I have a great job, I'm really happy." But some of them will have thought about starting a company for a while and was hoping that someone would come and ask them to do that. So you have to remove your fears and go and ask the best people.

(00:36:29):
The reason you want to have a technical co-founder and not a hired engineer or not a hired contracting team is because so many of the decisions you're going to make are technical and so many of the iterations you're going to make relies on engineering. And if you don't understand that, you won't actually make the right decisions anyway. It's not like service. You have an idea for a product, you build a product and you're done. There's infinite number of iterations in that process.

(00:36:54):
And then finally, I would say a lot of people learn how to code themselves, right? So there are a lot of places online that you can learn the skillset that takes to build a prototype. You might not be the best engineers. So there are many successful startup founders who are not the best engineers because they stop coding when they hire three or four engineers, that's fine. But you need to be sufficiently good that you understand the value of engineering and that you understand that the best way to solve most of the problem is with software. There are a lot of founders who just, for whatever reason, study something else that doesn't have to be a conscious or very precise reason that you had when you were 18 or 19 and then you're 25, you're like, "Oh, I wish I know how to code" and then just learn to code and they learn how to code. It's not that more difficult than that.

Lenny (00:37:42):
Have you ever seen a startup work out if they had a contracting firm, like engineering firm build a product? Does that ever work or were you just like, "No, do not ever do this"?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:37:53):
Basically, I can't recall any specific ones where people have a contracting firm but I've recalled founders where let's say you had two non-technical founders, but they valued engineering and they had an ability to build a team of great people that were not co-founders and they gave them equity and they become successful. There are many examples of that I would say, but I don't remember any specific examples where you had a contracting team building the whole thing. I think the reason for that is it takes more than just sort of riding a spec to build a product. You can't actually spec yourself to a great product. You have to just be part of the iterations yourself. That's why I think someone being the engineer, having the idea of what iteration looks like and just doing it is how you do things.

(00:38:38):
I think that the cases where I've seen non-technical founders make this work is that they have really good engineering teams who feel like they're founding team. It might not be co-founders per YC-7 definition of having 10%, but they feel like they're the bonding team.

Lenny (00:38:52):
This reminds me of a story of just the recent podcast interview I did with the CPO of Calendly. She talked about how when Calendly started, they actually had a Ukrainian dev team built the first product. Not only did they help them build the first product, they actually ended up driving all the growth initially because they saw Calendly and started using it within their firm.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:14):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:14):
And then everyone that they knew started using it and spread within Ukraine and they actually continue to work with that firm. They're still the [inaudible 00:39:20] team for Calendly or some part of it.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:22):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:24):
Yeah

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:24):
Wow, that's cool.

Lenny (00:39:24):
There's a success story.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:26):
I mean, I would say it's certainly the case that in some countries people have other jobs while they start the startups, so like the engineers. In Ukraine for example or in Eastern Europe, it's very common that if they start their own startup, they actually have a full-time job as a contractor while they're starting the startup because that's how you pay the bill because often you can't raise money. And that's fine too.

Lenny (00:39:46):
Amazing. That's some hustle.

(00:39:49):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time-consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(00:40:47):
I want to zoom out a little bit and ask another big question and see what answer you have for this. If you just think about the most successful startups in YC or even just the companies you worked with, if you had to pick just one or two attributes of what's most common across successful companies, what would that be?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:41:04):
I would say the most common reason that I've seen founders succeed or companies succeed, it comes down to the founders and characteristics of those individuals. The most important characteristics of those individuals are they're really determined to win and they don't give up when things are hard and they have an internal motivation that's just really infectious to people around them, which is how they end up building really good teams around them. People are actually going to want to go and work for them. I have numerous examples of people like this where the CEO or one of the founders are just really inspirational people.

(00:41:42):
The second thing I would say is they are technical. So that's kind of like they're technical enough. If I would grade companies on a scale of technical to less technical, more technical founders are more likely to succeed, I would say. And then I would say they figure out how to talk to users and move fast early on so they don't wait for permission from their investors or from YC or from someone else to make progress. They're like, every day or every week there's continuous progress. They're not doing this for someone else, they're doing this for the customers. They're not doing this for the investors, that's for sure. The investors are sort of in the way more or less. And they're just naturally focusing on the customers.

(00:42:29):
Finally, what I would say is the skill that's really attributed to great founders is excellent communication skills. So the ability to communicate really complicated ideas clearly, to enjoy the communication part, right? Enjoying communication is often kind of correlated with enjoying doing fundraising, which is an important part of some companies' success. Not all of them, but for some of them. I would say communication or storytelling is part of the same arc, right? And those are part of the same thing that actually motivates people around you. If you can communicate why you're building, what you're building and why it's important to the world, tell a story about that, that can motivate people around you to just want to follow you. I think it's rare that I've seen founders succeed where the founder isn't in some way an inspirational person or someone that is a good communicator. Most of the time, you at least have respect or you somewhere know that they're going to succeed, right? And that is what inspires you to be around them or be on their team.

Lenny (00:43:33):
That is a really cool list. So just to summarize, one, they have the strong will to win, and with that they're inspirational. They kind of pull people along and get people really excited. Two is they're more likely to succeed if they're technical and can build a thing. Three, they figure out how to talk to customers, don't wait, just start doing it. And they're just obsessed with that versus what investors want them to do and they don't want to talk to the investors to make time for the customers. And then excellent communication skills, which comes back to the first. They're able to story tell and get people excited. Is that right?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:44:06):
Yeah, I would say those are the attributes of successful things. To be a super successful company, there's something else that have to happen. Those things are not things you can put on a list because they are the outliers, right? If you look at startups on a typical YC batch, there'd be a couple billion companies. Those are the outliers. They'll almost certainly have all the things that we've talked about. Many other companies in the batch will have that too, but then what makes someone a true outlier is something that is unknown. That's why so many investors said no to Airbnb when they were not trying to raise money because that was an outlier idea. It was an idea that was not logical and did not make sense to most people. Those kind of ideas, the ones that end up succeeding often don't make sense to people. There's some reason that no one has done this before because they're just not natural next step of the world.

Lenny (00:44:57):
That's a great segue to a question I've been meaning to ask, which is, how good are you at predicting in a batch which startups are going to be the monster hits? So maybe like you and then just generally YC, how good are you all at knowing what's going to work out, is going to be the next Airbnb or Dropbox?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:45:14):
I think the truth is that we're not very good at knowing what's going to succeed. Certainly we cannot figure out who's going to be the really successful company in the batch. That's not possible. What we're good at is knowing what failure looks like. What we sometimes like to tell founders at the beginning of the batch is like, "If you fail, please do it in some new exciting way. Not one that we've seen 100 times." Because we have seen people fail for a large number of reasons. The best way for us to sort of not predict, but the best way for us to make more companies succeed is to tell them how they might fail, right? Be very direct and honest with them and say, "You doing these three things, these things are likely going to lead that you won't succeed." And if we do our job well, most people get that feedback and they're on the track for succeeding.

(00:46:06):
Now, which of those companies end up becoming the best? There are so many things that are uncorrelated to being the best, and it's the things that people don't like. I'm in a hot industry, I was writing up on TechCrunch like, this investor started talking to me. You'd be surprised how many of the things I just mentioned are uncorrelated to outlier success, right? That's why it's so hard to actually do this. I think people really want these questions to be answered. People really want to believe that you can pick really great companies at the seed stage, but everything I've learned from the plus 600 companies that I've worked with is that it's just not that easy and it's maybe not even possible and certainly not possible when you talk about finding the outlier companies. I don't think it's that easy. And if it was easy, then we would accept a lot fewer companies. We just accept those ones, but it's just not that easy.

Lenny (00:46:59):
Do you have a sense of which ones are likely to work out better than others? Or is it just like, "We have 150 really unclear, but one of these, hopefully."

# Why AI evals are the hottest new skill for product builders | Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
To build great AI products, you need to be really good at building evals. It's the highest ROI activity you can engage in.

Hamel Husain (00:00:05):
This process is a lot of fun. Everyone that does this immediately gets addicted to it. When you're building an AI application, you just learn a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What's cool about this is you don't need to do this many, many times. For most products, you do this process once and then you build on it.

Shreya Shankar (00:00:18):
The goal is not to do evals perfectly, it's to actionably improve your product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
I did not realize how much controversy and drama there is around evals. There's a lot of people with very strong opinions.

Shreya Shankar (00:00:28):
People have been burned by evals in the past. People have done evals badly, so then they didn't trust it anymore, and then they're like, "Oh, I'm anti evals."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
What are a couple of the most common misconceptions people have with evals?

Hamel Husain (00:00:39):
The top one is, "We live in the age of AI. Can't the AI just eval it?" But it doesn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
A term that you used in your posts that I love is this idea of a benevolent dictator.

Hamel Husain (00:00:49):
When you're doing this open coding, a lot of teams get bogged down in having a committee do this. For a lot of situations, that's wholly unnecessary. You don't want to make this process so expensive that you can't do it. You can appoint one person whose taste that you trust. It should be the person with domain expertise. Oftentimes, it is the product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guests are Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar. One of the most trending topics on this podcast over the past year has been the rise of evals. Both the chief product officers of Anthropic and OpenAI shared that evals are becoming the most important new skill for product builders. And since then, this has been a recurring theme across many of the top AI builders I've had on. Two years ago, I had never heard the term evals. Now it's coming up constantly. When was the last time that a new skill emerged that product builders had to get good at to be successful?

(00:01:41):
Hamel and Shreya have played a major role in shifting evals from being an obscure, mysterious subject to one of the most necessary skills for AI product builders. They teach the definitive online course on evals, which happens to be the number one course on Maven. They've now taught over 2,000 PMs and engineers across 500 companies, including large swaths of the OpenAI and Anthropic teams along with every other major AI lab.

(00:02:07):
In this conversation, we do a lot of show versus tell. We walk through the process of developing an effective eval, explain what the heck evals are and what they look like, address many of the major misconceptions with evals, give you the first few steps you can take to start building evals for your product, and also share just a ton of best practices that Hamel and Shreya have developed over the past few years. This episode is the deepest yet most understandable primer you'll find on the world of evals. And honestly, it got me excited to write evals, even though I have nothing to write evals for. I think you'll feel the same way as you watch this.

(00:02:41):
If this conversation gets you excited, definitely check out Hamel and Shreya's course on Maven. We'll link to it in the show notes. If you use the code LENNYSLIST when you purchase the course, you'll get 35% off the price of the course. With that, I bring you Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar.

(00:02:58):

Hamel and Shreya, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Hamel Husain (00:05:04):
Thank you for having us.

Shreya Shankar (00:05:05):
Yeah, super excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:07):
I'm even more excited. Okay, so a couple years ago, I had never heard the term evals. Now it's one of the most trending topics on my podcast, essentially, that to build great AI products, you need to be really good at building evals. Also, it turns out some of the fastest-growing companies in the world are basically building and selling and creating evals for AI labs. I just had the CEO of Mercor on the podcast. So there's something really big happening here. I want to use this conversation to basically help people understand this space deeply, but let's start with the basics. Just what the heck are evals? For folks that have no idea what we're talking about, give us just a quick understanding of what an eval is, and let's start with Hamel.

Hamel Husain (00:05:49):
Sure. Evals is a way to systematically measure and improve an AI application, and it really doesn't have to be scary or unapproachable at all. It really is, at its core, data analytics on your LLM application and a systematic way of looking at that data, and where necessary, creating metrics around things so you can measure what's happening, and then so you can iterate and do experiments and improve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:22):
So that's a really good broad way of thinking about it. If you go one level deeper just to give people a very, even more concrete way of imagining and visualizing what we're talking about, even if you have a example to show would be even better, what's an even deeper way of understanding what an eval is?

Hamel Husain (00:06:36):
Let's say you have a real estate assistant application and it's not working the way you want. It's not writing emails to customers the way you want, or it's not calling the right tools, or any number of errors. And before evals, you would be left with guessing. You would maybe fix a prompt and hope that you're not breaking anything else with that prompt, and you might rely on vibe checks, which is totally fine.

(00:07:11):
And vibe checks are good and you should do vibe checks initially, but it can become very unmanageable very fast because as your application grows, it's really hard to rely on vibe checks. You just feel lost. And so evals help you create metrics that you can use to measure how your application is doing and kind of give you a way to improve your application with confidence. That you have a feedback signal in which to iterate against.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:44):
So just to make very real, so imagining this real estate agent, maybe they're helping you book a listing or go see an open house. The idea here is you have this agent talking to people, it's answering questions, pointing them to things. As a builder of that agent, how do you know if it's giving them good advice, good answers? Is it telling them things that are completely wrong?

(00:08:04):
So the idea of evals, essentially, is to build a set of tests that tell you, how often is this agent doing something wrong that you don't want it to do? And there's a bunch of ways you could define wrong. It could be just making up stuff. It could be just answering in a really strange way. The way I think about evals, and tell me if this is wrong, just simply is like unit tests for code. You're smiling. You're like, "No, you idiot."

Shreya Shankar (00:08:29):
No, that's not what I was thinking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Okay. Okay, okay, tell me. Tell me, how does that feel as a metaphor?

Shreya Shankar (00:08:35):
Okay. I like what you said first, which is we had a very broad definition. Evals is a big spectrum of ways to measure application quality. Now, unit tests are one way of doing this. Maybe there are some non-negotiable functionalities that you want your AI assistant to have, and unit tests are going to be able to check that. Now, maybe you also, because these AI assistants are doing such open-ended tasks, you kind of also want to measure how good are they at very vague or ambiguous things like responding to new types of user requests or figuring out if there's new distributions of data like new users are coming and using your real estate agent that you didn't even know would use your product. And then all of a sudden, you think, "Oh, there's a different way you want to kind of accommodate this new group of people."

(00:09:24):
So evals could also be a way of looking at your data regularly to find these new cohorts of people. Evals could also be like metrics that you just want to track over time, like you want to track people saying, "Yes. Thumbs up. I liked your message." You want very, very basic things that are not necessarily AI-related but can go back into this flywheel of improving your product. So I would say, overall, unit tests are a very small part of that very big puzzle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):
Awesome. You guys actually brought an example of an eval just to show us exactly what the hell we're talking about. We're talking in these big ideas. So how about let's pull one up and show people, "Here's what an eval is."

Hamel Husain (00:10:06):
Yeah, let me just set the stage for it a little bit. So to echo what Shreya said, it's really important that we don't think of evals as just tests. There's a common trap that a lot of people fall into because they jump straight to the test like, "Let me write some tests," and usually that's not what you want to do. You should start with some kind of data analysis to ground what you should even test, and that's a little bit different than software engineering where you have a lot more expectations of how the system is going to work. With LLMs, it's a lot more surface area. It's very stochastic, so you kind of have a different flavor here.

(00:10:47):
And so the example I'm going to show you today, it's actually a real estate example. It's a different kind of real estate example. It's from a company called Nurture Boss. I can share my screen to show you their website just to help you understand this use case a little bit, so let me share my screen. So this is a company that I worked with. It's called Nurture Boss, and it is a AI assistant for property managers who are managing apartments, and it helps with various tasks such as inbound leads, customer service, booking appointments, so on and so forth. It's like all the different sort of operations you might be doing as a property manager, it helps you with that. And so you can see kind of what they do. It's a very good example because it has a lot of the complexities of a modern AI application.

(00:11:40):
So there's lots of different channels that you can interact through the AI with like chat, text, voice, but also, there's tool calls, lots of tool calls for booking appointments, getting information about availability, so on and so forth. There's also RAG retrieval, getting information about customers and properties and things like that. So it's pretty fully fleshed in terms of an AI application. And so they have been really generous with me in allowing me to use their data as a teaching example. And so we have anonymized it, but what I'm going to walk through today is, okay, let's do the first part of how we would start to build evals for Nurture Boss. Why would we even want to do that?

(00:12:36):
So let's go through the very beginning stage, what we call error analysis, which is, let's look at the data of their application and first start with what's going wrong. So I'm going to jump to that next, and I'm going to open an observability tool. And you can use whatever you want here. I just happen to have this data loaded in a tool called Braintrust, but you can load it in anything. We don't have a favorite tool or anything in the blog post that we wrote with you. We had the same example but in Phoenix Arize, and I think Aman, on your blog post, used Phoenix Arize as well. And there's also LangSmith. So these are kind of like different tools that you can use.

(00:13:29):
So what you see here on the screen, this is logs from the application, and let me just show you how it looks. So what you see here is, and let me make it full screen, this is one particular interaction that a customer had with the Nurture Boss application, and what it is is a detailed log of everything that happened. So it's called a trace, and it's just the engineering term for logs of a sequence of events. The concept of a trace has been around for a really long time, but it's especially really important when it comes to AI applications.

(00:14:12):
And so we have all the different components and pieces and information that the AI needs to do its job, and we are logged all of it and we're looking at a view of that. And so you see here a system prompt. The system prompt says, "You are an AI assistant working as a leasing team member at Retreat at Acme Apartments." Remember, I said this is anonymized, so that's why the name is Acme Apartments. "Your primary role is to respond to text messages from both current residents and prospective residents. Your goal is to provide accurate, helpful information," yada, yada, yada. And then there's a lot of detail around guidelines of how we want this thing to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:56):
Is this their actual system prompt, by the way, for this company?

Hamel Husain (00:14:58):
It is. Yes, it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:58):
Amazing. That's so cool.

Hamel Husain (00:14:59):
It's a real system prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
That's amazing because it's rare you see a actual company product's system prompt. That's like their crown jewels a lot of times, so this is actually very cool on its own.

Hamel Husain (00:15:08):
Yeah. Yeah, it's really cool. And you see all of these different sort of features that are different use cases, so things about tour scheduling, handling applications, guidance on how to talk to different personas, so on and so forth. And you can see the user just kind of jumps in here and asks, "Okay, do you have a one-bedroom with study available? I saw it on virtual tours." And then you can see that the LLM calls some tools. It calls this get individual's information tool, and it pulls back that person's information. And then it gets the community's availability. So it's querying a database with the availability for that apartment complex.

(00:16:01):
And then finally, the AI responds, "Hey, we have several one-bedroom apartments available, but none specifically listed with a study. Here are a few options."

(00:16:12):
And then it says, "Can you let me know when one with a study is available?"

(00:16:16):
And then it says, "I currently don't have specific information on the availability of a one-bedroom apartment."

(00:16:23):
User says, "Thank you."

(00:16:25):
And the AI says, "You're welcome. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out." Now, this is an example of a trace, and we're looking at one specific data point. And so one thing that's really important to do when you're doing data analysis of your LLM application is to look at data. Now, you might wonder, "There's a lot of these logs. It's kind of messy. There's a lot of things going on here. How in the hell are you supposed to look at this data? Do you want to just drown in this data? How do you even analyze this data?"

(00:17:07):
So it turns out there is a way to do it that is completely manageable, and it's not something that we invented. It's been around in machine learning and data science for a really long time, and it's called error analysis. And what you do is, the first step in conquering data like this is just to write notes. Okay? So you got to put your product hat on, which is why we're talking to you, because product people have to be in the room and they have to be involved in sort of doing this. Usually a developer is not suited to do this, especially if it's not a coding application.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:47):
And just to mirror back, why I think you're saying that is because this is the user experience of your product. People talking to this agent is the entire product essentially, and so it makes sense for the product person to be super involved in this.

Hamel Husain (00:17:59):
Yeah. So let's reflect on this conversation. Okay, a user asked about availability. The AI said, "Oh, we don't really have that. Have a nice day." Now, for a product that is helping you with lead management, is that good? Do you feel like this is the way we want it to go?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Not ideal.

Hamel Husain (00:18:32):
Yes, not ideal, and I'm glad you said that. A lot of people would say, "Oh, it's great. The AI did the right thing. It looked, it said, 'We didn't have available,' and it's not available." But with your product hat on, you know that's not correct. And so what you would do is you would just write a quick note here. You would say, "Okay." You might pop in here, and you can write a note. So every observability application has ability to write notes, and you wouldn't try to figure out if something is wrong. In this case, it's kind of not doing the right thing, but you just write a quick note, "Should have handed off to a human."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:19):
And as we watch this happening, it's like you mention this and you'll explain more. You're doing this, this feels very manual and unscalable, but as you said, this is just one step of the process and there's a system to this. That was just the first one.

Hamel Husain (00:19:30):
Yeah, and you don't have to do it for all of your data. You sample your data and just take a look, and it's surprising how much you learn when you do this. Everyone that does this immediately gets addicted to it and they say, "This is the greatest thing that you can do when you're building an AI application." You just learn a lot and you're like, "Hmm, this is not how I want it to work. Okay." And so that's just an example.

(00:19:58):
So you write this note, and then we can go on to the next trace. So this is the next trace. I just pushed a hot key on my keyboard. Let me go back to looking at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:09):
And these tools make it easy to go through a bunch and add these notes quickly.

Hamel Husain (00:20:13):
Yes. And so this is another one. Similar system prompt. We don't need to go through all of it again. We'll just jump right into the user question. "Okay, I've been texting you all day." Isn't that funny? And the user says, "Please." Okay, yeah, this one is just like an error in the application where this is a text message application, sorry, the channel through which the customer is communicating is through text message, and you're just getting really garbled. And you can see here that it kind of doesn't make sense. The words are being cut off like, "In the meantime," and then the system doesn't know how to respond, because you know how people text message, they write short phrases. They split their sentence across four or five different turns. So in this case-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:16):
Yeah, so what do you do with something like that?

Hamel Husain (00:21:18):
Yeah, so this is a different kind of error.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:19):
Mm.

Hamel Husain (00:21:19):
This is more of, "Hey, we're not handling this interaction correctly. This is more of a technical problem," rather than, "Hey, the AI is not doing exactly what we want." So we would write that down too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):
Which is still really cool.

Hamel Husain (00:21:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
It's amazing you're catching that, too, here. Otherwise, you'd have no idea this was happening.

Hamel Husain (00:21:35):
Yeah, you might not know this is happening, right? And so you would just say, "Okay." You would write a note like, "Oh, conversation flow is janky because of text message."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
And I like that, I like that you're using the word janky. It shows you just how informal this can be at this stage.

Hamel Husain (00:21:56):
Yeah, it's supposed to be chill. Just don't overthink it. And there's a way to do this. So the question always comes up, how do you do this? Do you try to find all the different problems in this trace? What do you write a note about? And the answer is, just write down the first thing that you see that's wrong, the most upstream error. Don't worry about all the errors, just capture the first thing that you see that's wrong, and stop, and move on. And you can get really good at this. The first two or three can be very painful, but you can do a bunch of them really fast.

(00:22:38):
So here's another one, and let's skip the system prompt again. And the user asks, "Hey, I'm looking for a two- to three-bedroom with either one or two baths. Do you provide virtual tours?"

(00:22:51):
And a bunch of tools are called and it says, "Hi Sarah. Currently, we have three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom apartment available for $2,175. Unfortunately, we don't have any two-bedroom options at the moment. We do offer virtual tours. You can schedule a tour," blah, blah. It just so happens that there is no virtual tour, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):
Mm-hmm. Nice.

Hamel Husain (00:23:16):
So it is hallucinating something that doesn't exist. Then you kind of have to bring your context as an engineer, or even product content, and say, "Hey, this is kind of weird. We shouldn't be telling a person about virtual tour when it's not offered."

(00:23:32):
So you would say, "Okay, offered virtual tour," and you just write the note. So you can see there's a diversity of different kinds of errors that we're seeing, and we're actually learning a lot about your application in a very short amount of time.

Shreya Shankar (00:23:55):
One common question that we get from people at this stage is, "Okay, I understand what's going on. Can I ask an LLM to do this process for me?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:04):
Mm, great question.

Shreya Shankar (00:24:04):
And I loved Hamel's most recent example because what we usually find when we try to ask an LLM to do this error analysis is it just says the trace looks good because it doesn't have the context needed to understand whether something might be bad product smell or not. For example, the hallucination about scheduling the tour, right? I can guarantee you, I would bet money on this, if I put that into chat GPT and asked, "Is there an error?" it would say, "No, did a great job."

(00:24:34):
But Hamel had the context of knowing, "Oh, we don't actually have this virtual tour functionality," right? So I think, in these cases, it's so important to make sure you are manually doing this yourself. And we can talk a little bit more about when to use LLMs in the process later, but number one pitfall right here is people are like, "Let me automate this with an LLM."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:55):
Do you think we'll get to a place where an agent can do this, where it has that context?

Shreya Shankar (00:24:58):
Oh, no. No, no, no. Sorry. There are parts of error analysis that an LLM is suited for, which we could talk about later in this podcast. But right now, in this stage of free form, note-taking is not the place for an LLM.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
Got it. And this is something you call open coding, this step?

Shreya Shankar (00:25:14):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):
Cool. Another term that you used in your posts that I love and that fits into this step is this idea of a benevolent dictator. Maybe just talk about what that is, and maybe, Shreya, cover that.

Shreya Shankar (00:25:27):
Yeah, so Hamel actually came up with this term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
Okay, maybe Hamel cover that, actually.

Hamel Husain (00:25:33):
No problem. And we'll actually show the LLM automation in this example, because we're going to take this example, we're going to go all the way through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:40):
Amazing.

Hamel Husain (00:25:41):
And so benevolent dictator is just a catchy term for the fact that when you're doing this open coding, a lot of teams get bogged down in having a committee do this. And for a lot of situations, that's wholly unnecessary. People get really uncomfortable with, "Okay, we want everybody on board. We want everybody involved," so on and so forth. You need to cut through the noise. And a lot of organizations, if you look really deeply, especially small, medium-sized companies, you can appoint one person whose tastes that you trust. And you can do this with a small number of people and often one person, and it's really important to make this tractable. You don't want to make this process so expensive that you can't do it. You're going to lose out.

(00:26:36):
So that's the idea behind benevolent dictator, is, "Hey, you need to simplify this across as many dimensions as you can." Another thing that we'll talk about later is when it goes to building an LLM as a judge, you need a binary score. You don't want to think about, "Is this like a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?" Like, assign a score to it. You can't. That's going to slow it down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Just to make sure this benevolent dictator point is really clear, basically, this is the person that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):
Make sure this benevolent dictator point is really clear. Basically, this is the person that does this note-taking, and ideally they're the expert on the stuff. So if it's law stuff, maybe there's a legal person that owns this, it could be a product manager. Give us advice on who this person should be?

Hamel Husain (00:27:16):
Yeah. It should be the person with domain expertise. So in this case, it would be the person who understands the business of leasing, apartment leasing, and has context to understand if this makes sense. It's always a domain expert, like you said. Okay. For legal, it would be a law person. For mental health, it would be the mental health expert, whether that's a psychiatrist or someone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:41):
Cool.

Hamel Husain (00:27:42):
Though oftentimes, it is the product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:44):
Cool. So the advice here is pick that person. It may not feel so super fair that they're the one in charge and they're the dictator, but they're benevolent. It's going to be okay.

Hamel Husain (00:27:52):
Yeah. It's going to be okay. It's not perfection. You're just trying to make progress and get signal quickly so you have an idea of what to work on because it can become infinitely expensive if you're not careful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:07):
Yeah. Okay, cool. Let's go back to your examples.

Hamel Husain (00:28:09):
Yeah, no problem. So this is another example where we have someone saying, "Okay. Do you have any specials?" And the assistant or the AI responds, "Hey, we have a 5% military discount." User responds, and it switches the subject, "Can you tell me how many floors there are? Do you have any one-bedrooms available or one-bedrooms on the first floor?" And the AI responds, "Yeah, okay. We have several one-bedroom apartments available." And then the user wants to confirm, "Any of those on the first floor and how much are the one-bedrooms?" And then also, it's a current resident, so they're also asking, "I need a maintenance request."

(00:28:56):
You could see the messiness of the real world in here, and the assistant just calls a tool that says transfer call, but it doesn't say anything. It just abruptly does transfer call, so it's pretty jank, I would say. It's just not-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:13):
Another jank.

## Transcript

Greg Isenberg (00:00):
I'm Greg Isenberg and I build community. I'm the CEO of Late Checkout, an agency, a studio, a fund where we build some of the most popular internet communities. I'm also an advisor to Reddit.

Sahil Bloom (00:14):
I'm Sahil Bloom. I'm an investor, creator, entrepreneur, writer. I also gave up a grand slam on ESPN in 2012, and I am still waiting for it to land. What is The Room Where it Happens? The Room Where it Happens is the place where the insights are generated. This is the place where the conversations happen, where ideas are batted around, debated, fought over. This is where things actually get created, where you start to have those seeds that are planted and where things are really built. That is the room. It's traditionally been closed. We're opening the door to it. We want you to be here with us as that happens.

Greg Isenberg (00:52):
It's a place where we could have honest conversations about how hard startups are, what's interesting to us, how we can collaborate, how we can build businesses together and what the next big thing is. That's what The Room Where it Happens is.

Sahil Bloom (01:09):
If this podcast were available five years ago for me, I think I would've meaningfully accelerated the trajectory of my own life and my career. And part of that would've been the insights generated. The things I learned from actually listening to people. But the biggest part of it would've been the people I met. The relationships I built with other community members with the hosts, with the guests. That is what is the force multiplier for your career, those networks, how that compounds over time, just as well as any financial investment. That is what I would've gotten out of it.

Greg Isenberg (01:39):
I probably would've met my co-founder. I probably would've met my early teammates. I probably would've found community. I would be 25 times more informed and 50 times more wealthy. That would've just supercharged my career.

Sahil Bloom (01:58):
Greg and I met in The Room Where it Happens. We met through the confluence of a bunch of chance events. We were in a group text thread together with a handful of friends and became as close as we are today because of that. It was The Room Where it Happens. All of these ideas were being generated and that was what sparked us, originally, to start thinking about this and thinking about how we could scale this so that more of you could be a part of what we had experienced and what we had benefited from.

Greg Isenberg (02:27):
The moment that changed my mind about business and opportunity was the first time I ever went to Silicon Valley. I was reading up about all these entrepreneurs, all these investors on places like TechCrunch. And I landed and I expected them to be incredibly great, so much different from you and I. And I started having conversations with them and I realized they weren't smarter than us. They might have had better connections, more money, gone to better schools, but that was it. That was when I realized I could do anything.

Sahil Bloom (03:03):
So a moment that changed my mind about all of this, about business, opportunity, everything, I got invited by a mentor to go to a fundraiser event. I was 24. I was fresh out of school, very green. And I went to this event. There were all these amazing people there, really impressive people that I was, frankly, quite intimidated by. And I was in these conversations with them and just very quickly realized that there was nothing different about them versus me, but they were in these rooms constantly. They were around different, interesting people. They were having these conversations and that was what was making them different. They were able to generate these insights because they were in these room. And that was the moment I realized I had to just find a way to be in those rooms.

Greg Isenberg (03:49):
The gap between what people think business is and what actually happens is what Scott Belsky calls the messy middle. Think of The Social Network, the movie. Mark Zuckerberg starts Facebook and then all of a sudden it's massive. It's this romantic idea that people have about startups and entrepreneurship. In reality, the messy middle, the time in between starting and the outcome is 99% of the process of business and startups and entrepreneurship. And I actually find that messy middle to be the most amount of fun. It's when you rise up, it's when you fall down, it's when you zig and it's when you zag.

Sahil Bloom (04:35):
So in my mind, the biggest gap between what people think business is versus what it really is, is that aspect of just crawling through the river of shit that exists between where you start and where you finish. It's like The Shawshank Redemption. You got to just go through that period. And to me, that's getting up every day and just getting punched in the gut over and over and over again, and being willing to get up and continue to push through and continue to work with your team, solicit feedback, work with others and just get through it. But that willingness to get punched in the face, to get knocked down and to get back up, no one talks about that. Everyone talks about the successes. You love the glamor you love when someone rings the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, when they IPO, they're billionaire, it's great.

(05:23):
No one talks about that middle time when you're just getting punched over and over and over again. What frustrates me most about the current state of podcasts is just that it's one sided. It all ends as soon as you finish the conversation during the interview. It's an interview, you talk to someone, you ask them questions and then it ends and that's it. That's all you get from them. And they might have said something amazing that intrigued you, that sparked your interest. You want to follow up, you want to dig deeper, but that's it. That's all you get and it's over. And so when I think about the opportunity that exists, it's changing that. Fundamentally flipping it on its head, making it a conversation, following up, digging deeper, going further with all the insights. That's how we take this entire thing to a whole new level.

Greg Isenberg (06:08):
I believe the current state of podcasting sucks. A few people have microphones and it's just not fair. What if you allowed a bunch of people to have microphones so they could connect, so they can collaborate so that they can build community. And that's what we're trying to do with The Room Where it Happens. Yes, we're in the room and we have some microphones, but we're also inviting you in. We want you to ask questions. We want to collaborate with you. We want to build businesses with you. And that's why I wanted to create a new, more modern way of podcasting. What am I most excited about with this show and community?

Sahil Bloom (06:46):
It has to be seeing the amazing things that come out of this community. It has to be seeing all of you going off and having these great experiences, having new insights that come from it, starting new things, failing, succeeding, all of that. And what it's going to create out in the world is what I'm most excited about. We get to sit here, have conversations. We get to hang out with friends, talk to some amazing guests, but the thing that's going to be best is when we see you take that and run with it 100 times over to create something much bigger than what we are doing here.

Greg Isenberg (07:20):
Watching where you are today and where you're going to be tomorrow and where you're going to be a week from now, a month, a year, 10 years. We're in this for the long game. And what excites me about... I mean, the reason why I got into community was because I love seeing people progress, advance, do big things. And I know that being a part of The Room Where it Happens, good things will happen to you.

Sahil Bloom (07:47):
So how are we going to ensure this is different than everything else out there? Two ways. Number one, alcohol. We're going to get everyone really drunk with us and it's going to be fun and we're going to get them loose. Because they're not going to be having the same conversation they're having on to every single other podcast, because they're going to be sitting there drinking with us and it's going to be fun. So that's number one. Number two, we want to learn from you. We want to get better at this. We're in it for the long game. This isn't one episode, this isn't one season. We're going to be doing it. So when you're hearing things, if you want us to improve on stuff, if you have ideas, episodes, be a part of it with us, tell us, message us. You're in the Discord, be there with us, help us improve as we grow, and we'll make sure that it is the best thing that we can possibly create.

Greg Isenberg (08:28):
And you're going to keep us on us. You're going to be in our Discord. You're going to be in our community. And if anything feels not authentic, not great, we're in this together, and we want to make this as authentic as possible.
