# How to build a high-performing growth team | Adam Fishman (Patreon, Lyft, Imperfect Foods)

## Transcript

Adam Fishman (00:00:00):
Onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Adam Fishman was the first growth and marketing hire at Lyft where he spent two and a half years leading their growth efforts. Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.

Lenny (00:01:19):
And in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.

Lenny (00:01:50):

Lenny (00:04:26):
Adam Fishman, welcome to the podcast.

Adam Fishman (00:04:30):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Super excited to be here. It's a pleasure to be on chatting with you today.

Lenny (00:04:36):
It's even more my pleasure. Thank you for being here. To set a little context for listeners that don't know too much about you yet, can you spend 45 seconds giving us a little overview of all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?

Adam Fishman (00:04:50):
Sure. I'm setting my timer for 45 seconds.

Lenny (00:04:53):
And, start.

Adam Fishman (00:04:55):
So I've been the Chief Product Officer and VP of Growth and Product at a bunch of different companies Imperfect Foods, Patreon, Lyft, the precursor to Lyft which was Zimride to name a few. Now, I do three things primarily, I'm an EIR at Reforge and a program partner, which means I create courses. I run an advisory practice on growth and product strategy, which keeps me pretty busy, and then I recently started a newsletter which was pretty much inspired by your work in this area over the last several years. Those are the three pillars of my life these days, my professional life at least.

Lenny (00:05:31):
Nailed it. Wow, that was very contained and clear. Let's plug the newsletter real quick. What's the URL? Is it fishmanafnewsletter.com?

Adam Fishman (00:05:39):
It is fishmanafnewsletter.com. I am blessed with great initials that allow me to have that name for a newsletter.

Lenny (00:05:47):
It's not obvious. Adam Fishman AF. There you go. That's the acronym. And then in terms of the advising, just to set this expectation, are you looking for more clients or are you capped out? How should people think about that as they listen?

Adam Fishman (00:05:58):
Well, I'm pretty busy, but it is a bit of a revolving door, so there's always some pipeline. So even if I can't work with folks right now, sometimes it makes sense for me to work with them a few months down the road. So always open to new interest and learning about new companies.

Lenny (00:06:12):
All right, great. We'll share how to contact you at the end of this and it will be in the show notes.

Adam Fishman (00:06:15):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:06:17):
One question I wanted to ask off the bat is, Lyft, you were there super early. I imagine it was an incredibly wild ride. I'm curious, what's the most tangible memory you have of your time at Lyft?

Adam Fishman (00:06:29):
I have a ton of memories from the almost three years that I was there, but I think the biggest one, and probably the most tactile or memorable thing was when we launched Lyft, when we were bringing it out of private beta, we had this press event at the office, which is in Soma, and it had these doors, these big huge garage style doors. And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most.

Lenny (00:07:14):
I love that. I hope there was no hair in this mustache cake.

Adam Fishman (00:07:18):
No, no, there was not. It was delicious.

Lenny (00:07:21):
Okay, awesome. Another question I always have for folks that worked at Lyft or at Uber is how they feel about Super Pumped and what it is like watching that, if you've seen it, what it's like watching the story of Uber and especially working for Lyft.

Adam Fishman (00:07:35):
Yeah, I have seen it. I actually read the book first. I've been a pretty big fan of Mike Isaac, who's the New York Times reporter who wrote it. So I've been a big fan of his reporting for a long time. I connected with him a bit while he was writing the book, and I would say, there were parts of it that were painful. It was like renavigating, relitigating a history that I had lived through already. And so much of that story was stuff that I had experienced pretty regularly while I was at Lyft battling against Uber.

Adam Fishman (00:08:04):
So one part of me was like, "I remember that. God, that was hard." Another part of me was happy to see that all of the things were out in the open finally, things that were hard to talk about about competitive practices and stuff like that and just shady things. And some part of me was happy that it was out there. And then one other thing separately, so I actually was interviewing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be an advisor with his company HitRecord while he was filming Super Bumped.

Adam Fishman (00:08:35):
And we had this conversation over Zoom when he was on break in between scenes of filming the show. And for those who don't know, he's the guy that plays Travis Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber. So he did this interview with me and he was in his trailer on set, fully decked out as TK in his look with his hair slicked back. And it was really funny and also cool to see him in this context. And he is probably the polar opposite from Travis Kalanick. Obviously they're both super successful, but JGL is a really down to earth, nice, very family-oriented calm guy. So anyways, this is a funny story of my time meeting and interviewing with him.

Lenny (00:09:19):
That is amazing. Did you slip in a couple Lyft facts to help Lyft look a little happier and better?

Adam Fishman (00:09:26):
I did. We talked a bit about that journey and I asked him some questions about how he prepared for the role and stuff like that. And so yeah, it was pretty fun. We swapped some stories and stuff. So yeah, it was neat.

Lenny (00:09:37):
Fun fact, my mom wanted me to dress like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I was like, "I should look like this guy. Wear some vests. This guy's looking good. Looks like you a little bit."

Adam Fishman (00:09:48):
I see that. I do see that. That's awesome. Way to go, mom.

Lenny (00:09:51):
Yeah. Then I'll follow her advice. Maybe I should have.

Adam Fishman (00:09:54):
It didn't work out so well.

Lenny (00:09:56):
Yeah. Okay. So transitioning to the meat of our chat, there's three things I wanted to spend our time chatting about. One is your growth competency model, which essentially is this post you wrote recently that tells founders how to hire and how to evaluate growth people. Two, I want to chat about onboarding flows. You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?

Adam Fishman (00:10:27):
Yeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.

Lenny (00:10:32):
Okay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?

Adam Fishman (00:10:59):
Yeah, so first I'm going to put up my new background here, which is my growth competency model background. For those watching on YouTube, I have a funny graphic in the background for this. So I guess the reason that I wrote this, there were a few reasons that I wrote it. One is it really felt necessary to write it. And at first it's, I don't think I've ever come across this type of canonical reference before around how to hire and plan for growth. So that's number one. I didn't think it existed. It needed to exist.

Adam Fishman (00:11:32):
Two, as an advisor and someone who has held the head of growth role many times, I get asked this question a lot. I get asked all the time about how do you hire growth people? And it's usually something like, "Hey, how do we find you but 10 years earlier in your career?" And it feels like that question is missing the first principles approach to hiring a growth person. And if you're doing that, you're just pattern matching to me. And I may not be the best person, right, or somebody who looks like me may not be the best person. So I think we're missing that.

Adam Fishman (00:12:09):
And then third, one of the programs that I'm currently creating is around growth leadership. And so I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to be an exceptional growth leader, how you hire other people onto your team and create balanced teams. And this is going to be a really important component of that program. So it was just really top of mind. So yeah, that's why I wrote it.

Lenny (00:12:30):
Let me ask one quick question and I think you were about to start answering one mistakes founders make, but I guess it's less of a question. I know this was built on another model for product management, which is really awesome. And I love that there's this growing fountain of career ladders, competencies per function. And so I don't know if there's been one that's really great for design and engineering, but I love that this is happening. And so first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you put in the time to think this through.

Adam Fishman (00:12:54):
Cool. Thank you. Yeah, and I do think we need more of these. I think we need one for marketers, I think we need one for engineers, designers, research probably, there's probably a bunch of functions that could benefit from some canonicalized resource around this stuff. So yeah, some myths and mistakes that I think founders made and that I've made. I've definitely lived through some mistakes. A few experiences where I was hired into a company where the founder had really messed up expectations of what a growth person should be doing, what I should be doing. And I wanted to set the record straight for founders because they are the folks who hire for this and other leaders.

Adam Fishman (00:13:34):
So one example that comes to mind is, I did a very brief stint at a company called Wyzant, in between Lyft and Patreon. And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're looking for what I would call a silver bullet strategy to their growth challenges. And what they really needed, and I was naive and didn't think about asking these questions or about evaluating this properly, what they really needed was to create a strategy to add on new growth loops and a system for how to execute against that strategy.

Adam Fishman (00:14:13):
If we had talked about that as part of evaluating each other, as part of them evaluating me, it would've given me a lot of confidence that it was the right hire to make. But the problem was they didn't approach it that way. They didn't ask me those questions and I was too naive to recognize that, "Hey, they're not actually evaluating this with the competencies that you would expect for a growth leader." Executing a growth strategy takes time and patience, and they didn't really have it. And overall it ended rather unsuccessfully. I helped them build this office in San Francisco, hired a bunch of folks, we actually closed down the office. I had to lay off a bunch of the people that I'd hired, including myself, which wasn't particularly fun. And I think all of it comes back to that they didn't have a really strong set of criteria on what it meant to hire a great growth person. And so if I can help even just a little bit with founders making that decision better, it'll lead to fewer mismatches I think in the hiring process.

Lenny (00:15:11):
Awesome. Let's get into it. What are the components of this model? And you can put it back up again for folks to follow along in the background.

Adam Fishman (00:15:18):
It's coming back.

Lenny (00:15:18):
It's like a TikTok.

Adam Fishman (00:15:19):
The whole thing looks like a big circle and there's four wedges in that circle, four equal parts. And I think that answer of what are the components, what should people look for, really, I'll give the PM answer, which is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on the state of the team and where the skill gaps are. So the goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist. I am not an 11 out of 10 on these skills and I have been a growth executive at many companies. I consider myself to be pretty good at the job. The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio.

Adam Fishman (00:16:06):
And so when you think about it, there are four main components to the growth competency model. And the four big components or buckets are growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and then the last one is communication and influence. And each of those has three really specific skills. And so to give an example, let's break down growth execution for example, which is one of the very first ones that you should be good at if you're a growth practitioner. Within this competency grouping, there's three individual competencies that are channel fluency, experimentation, and what I'd call productizing learnings. And so you can evaluate and ask questions to understand how good people are at these different things and what their experience has been with them.

Adam Fishman (00:16:54):
So in productizing learnings for example, one of the key things that a growth person has to do is generate hypotheses, learn from those hypotheses and then translate that into changes that they're making in the product. And you want to find somebody who has a track record of at least understanding how to take something they have learned that might be an experiment or something that's very NVP and turn that into something that has hooks into different areas of the product. And so that's a critical skill to evaluate. And one of an example, the overall set of competencies.

Lenny (00:17:26):
To throw in a question real quick, is one way to use this model, coming back to your Wyzant example where there's of course misalignment between you and the founder to sit down and look at this circle here and be like, "Here's where I'm strong, here's where maybe we need to hire someone to take over."

Adam Fishman (00:17:41):
Yeah, absolutely. You can almost use it as a reverse interviewing characteristic and say, "What are the competencies you, founder, CEO, care about? What's really important to you for the first person in this role? Or the expectations that you have of what I will bring to the table." And then you can be really candid about what you're good at and what you're not good at, where you're developing. So yeah, I agree with that for sure.

Lenny (00:18:06):
Awesome. I know this also plays into evaluating your performance and it could be like, "Hey Adam, here's the three things that we want to focus on in the next cycle."

Adam Fishman (00:18:13):
For sure. Yeah. It's really a good foundational framework for being really concrete and specific in the feedback that you provide someone. So rather than saying, "Adam, you really need to be more strategic." Everybody's heard that at some point and it's like, "Well, what do you mean?" You can say, "Hey, we need to work on the area of growth strategy and that means I need to see better modeling of loops out of you, better understanding communication of what those loops are." And you can give really concrete feedback.

Lenny (00:18:44):
Awesome. So we've talked about growth execution, What's next?

Adam Fishman (00:18:47):
The next one is what I would call customer knowledge. And within customer knowledge there's a set of things and really this is about data fluency and instrumentation, understanding user psychology, which is a big one, and then this idea of being able to experiment and learn over time and how you develop your narrative and your creative approach to talking to customers. I love user psychology and it's one of the things that I think attracted me to growth and to product. I studied consumer psychology when I was in college and I'm just probably would've been a psychologist if not for a growth practitioner, which is a weird other approach I could have taken in my career. But-

Lenny (00:19:35):
It's not too late to pivot.

Adam Fishman (00:19:37):
... Second career. Yeah, actually, announcing today I'm pivoting the newsletter to just talk about therapy and psychology.

Lenny (00:19:43):
Yes. This is going to be the title of the podcast.

Adam Fishman (00:19:47):
Awesome. So like user psychology, I think one of the things that people don't easily understand is that most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. And the reality is, don't do that. And so you have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? And it often, as I mentioned, stems from some emotional challenge that they're having or something that they're seeking. And it's not because your product is the best chat bot or because it gives the best answers. There's a different thing that they're trying to solve. And only when you address that can you move on to those other things. So that's the second competency is, customer knowledge.

Lenny (00:20:34):
It reminds me of something I mentioned on some podcast recently, this tweet that one of the Collison brothers tweeted about how user research is often misunderstood in that people think you do user research and that informs what you build. And instead the way you think about it is user research informs your model of your customer and that model informs what you build.

Adam Fishman (00:20:56):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:20:56):
And the more user research you do, the more your model evolves to help you understand the customer. And that's been really helpful for me because I never thought of it that way.

Adam Fishman (00:21:04):
Yeah. I think that's a great example. Seeking the solution in a customer interview is never going to work, right? You seek to understand and then you take that away and you can think through what the model should look like and how things should change as a result. Yeah. That's great. I can cover the third and fourth competency-

Lenny (00:21:24):
That's good.

Adam Fishman (00:21:25):
... and I'll try to be a little more brief on that.

Lenny (00:21:27):
No, no. It's good.

Adam Fishman (00:21:28):
The third competency is growth strategy. And now the third and fourth competencies I would say are a bit more advanced topics. And again, remember when I said people index higher or lower on these as they go across their career, I would expect a more junior growth person to not necessarily be a 10 out of 10 on strategy and communication. These are things that you really have to work at a long time. They tend to be softer skills in a lot of cases and you learn best by either getting it very right or getting it very wrong. And so you've got to put in the time to develop these. But in growth strategy, there's three. The first one is growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?

Adam Fishman (00:22:18):
The second one is capital allocation and forecasting. This is basically where are you deploying either your money, your people, how are you managing the portfolio and how are you projecting that out into the future? And that's a really hard one. You have to become best buddies with your finance friends in order to do that. And so anyways, that's capital allocation and forecasting. And then the third one is prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models. You have to have the capital or the people to allocate to that stuff. And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.

Adam Fishman (00:23:09):
And there's a lot of ways to test this stuff. Situational, behavioral, interviewing, I talk a lot about this in my post on hiring growth. There's like very specific questions you can ask to understand what people have done or what they might do in different situations. There's case studies and things like that. So that's the third one. And then the fourth one is communication and influence.

Adam Fishman (00:23:29):
And I would say, I think you probably know this as a PM, influence is one of the biggest and hardest skills to develop. It's no different in a growth practitioner and in some cases it can even be harder because sometimes people come in with a preconceived notion of what growth is and isn't and you have to change their mind. And so within communication and influence, there's strategic communication. So how do a series of experiments and a series of things that you're trying, fit into the overall picture of a bigger bet that you're taking?

Adam Fishman (00:24:06):
How do you lead a team? So team leadership is a big part of communication and influence. And then how do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth. And I would say, this is the pinnacle, right? This is the hardest one. It's a lifelong journey. It relies very extensively on understanding people and who you're talking to. And those people can be very different from company to company and the currency that they trade in can be really different. And so this one is one where you have to go back to square one and relearn who the people are that you're working with every time you step into a new role or a new company or get a new leader or something like that. So it can be really challenging and it's never done.

Lenny (00:25:03):
That component of the competency models, we're the PM of the growth PM role feels like if you were to do these Venn diagram of the two roles, feels like that's a big part of the overlap.

Adam Fishman (00:25:13):
Yep, absolutely. There's a lot of overlap between exceptional product managers and exceptional growth practitioners. I think sometimes they just use the skills in different ways. So you need to be great at product strategy to be a product leader, you need to be great at growth strategy to be a growth leader. Just what those things look like can be different between the two. But they're both required skills, required competencies to be exceptional at the role.

Lenny (00:25:38):
So just to rehash, the four categories are communication influence, growth execution, customer knowledge and growth strategy. You mentioned earlier that people often come to you and they're like, "How do we find another Adam?" And your feedback is one, how do you know that's exactly what you need? And then two, find someone that's up and coming more because it's so hard to find folks like you that are actually ready to take on a head of growth role.

Adam Fishman (00:26:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:26:03):
So a question for you is, one is, do you recommend founders focus on finding someone that's more up and coming and fast learning with a high trajectory? And if so, which of these components would you suggest they look for most?

Adam Fishman (00:26:19):
One of the challenges of hiring a senior person is that they're all off writing newsletters and making podcast.

Lenny (00:26:25):
Right.

Adam Fishman (00:26:25):
Not that we know anybody who does that or anything, but-

Lenny (00:26:28):
No. That's bullshit. What is that?

Adam Fishman (00:26:29):
Yeah. So I don't want to right now go back and work at a company again. I'm enjoying what I'm doing and so it's hard to get me, right? But also you don't want me, I think, when you're doing this for the first time. So I think the key there is smart and driven people for sure. Age and youth is a bit relative I'd say. So I would think about hiring somebody who you might say is less experienced in growth, but they could be very senior in another aspect of their career. You can also benefit from hiring somebody internally who wants to branch out into growth. And one of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge. They might understand your customer base super well because they're already inside the company.

Adam Fishman (00:27:15):
So if you're going to hire a junior person, the key is, how do you help them learn? And I think if you don't know what you're doing as the founder or the leader, it's hard. You're not going to be able to help them yourself. So you've got to be willing to invest in advisors like me, outside education, mentorship, coaching, otherwise, what's going to happen is that very driven, hungry and enthusiastic person is going to run through a lot of brick walls, which is great, except they're going to miss the fact that the door was standing right next to the wall that they just ran through and you're going to end up with a lot of bricks on the ground.

Lenny (00:27:54):
Excellent metaphor.

Adam Fishman (00:27:56):
Yeah, thank you. And so I have some examples of both hiring people and moving people over in my career. So I think tangible examples are really helpful here. So when I was at Lyft, I had the privilege of hiring that young, smart and driven person a bunch of times, but one of the people who comes to mind is a guy named Ben Lauzier. You should have him on the podcast at some point. He's French, he's very nice to listen to you. He was most recently a VP of product at Thumbtack, but he was definitely not that when I hired him, he was a jack of all trades marketer working at a corporate catering startup when I hired him at Lyft. And he had nailed most of the growth execution and the customer knowledge competencies.

Adam Fishman (00:28:38):
One was, he was an avid Lyft user himself, so he really understood the product really well. And also, he was just very thoughtful about how he executed, how he experimented. He had done a lot of it and he was very skilled at pulling them off in a very small environment because he had just had to be. And those are the two most important competencies when you're bringing in a younger, earlier stage person because teaching somebody how to execute is not that fun, right? That's a hard skill. The ability to execute is something like executive function skills and things like that. If you haven't developed those by the time you are an adult, I don't know that I'm going to be able to teach you and I'm certainly probably not the right person to teach you. You should definitely get some outside assistance with that. And so I like to get those types of people that have those things if I'm hiring that generally inexperienced growth practitioner.

Lenny (00:29:42):
And the two things you said are customer knowledge and execution. Is that the two you said?

Adam Fishman (00:29:46):
Yes. Customer knowledge and growth execution. And so let me tell you an execution story about Ben really quick. This comes also down to work ethic too. So we interviewed Ben and it was a long day of interviews in a tiny glass conference room and Lyft was, I don't know, 30 people or something at the time. At one of the interview breaks, Ben had come over and he didn't have his computer and anything like that. And so he was ducking out of work to do the interview. And he actually came out of the office and he's like, "Hey, does anybody have a computer that I can borrow?" And so we gave him this old crappy Chromebook and I was like, "Why do you need a computer?" And he's like, "I have to go edit this file and do this thing and check something in at work and deploy this thing or whatever."

Adam Fishman (00:30:32):
And I'm like, "Wow, this is a guy that really knows how to get stuff done and is so much so that he's pausing his interview process so that he could go get a thing done for his company that he's actively trying to leave, but he's got this work ethic and this execution." And that really stuck with me. And he probably would remember this story if we brought it up. So the time he borrowed a crappy Chromebook laptop to do work at the job that he was trying to leave.

Lenny (00:31:00):
What are the chances that was staged?

Adam Fishman (00:31:01):
He seemed very innocent. So I think not staged.

Lenny (00:31:06):
Okay, great.

Adam Fishman (00:31:06):
But I could be wrong. But now everyone that interviews that is going to ask to borrow a laptop and-

Lenny (00:31:10):
That's right.

Adam Fishman (00:31:10):
... check in some work.

Lenny (00:31:11):
The phone call.

Adam Fishman (00:31:13):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:13):
"Adam, I need to fix something."

Adam Fishman (00:31:15):
That's right. So that's Ben. And then on the other side, and I'll cover this one really quickly, and the other side of moving somebody over internally, I had equally great success with that. So there was another person named Sean at Patreon who was a marketer, again, a jack of all trades marketer. And I think I have a propensity and a bias towards folks like that because that's one of the ways that I started my career was in marketing. But anyways, I moved him over from marketing to being a growth PM, an entry level growth PM.

Adam Fishman (00:31:47):
And he had a ton of the execution skills, ability to prioritize really well and customer knowledge skills as well, more so on the customer side because he was an internal transfer, so he really knew our customers. He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability to access and pull out insights and information. And so he turned out to be really great, but just a very different profile of a person than Ben was. And here's an internal hire versus an external hire.

# An inside look at how the New York Times builds product | Alex Hardiman (CPO, the New York Times)

## Transcript

Alex Hardiman (00:00:00):
One thing that's really interesting is that our impact and our business goals are in service of our mission, which is to seek the truth and help people understand the world, not the other way around. What it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy at a time when people are struggling to understand basic facts and struggling to understand each other. That means that impact for us is growing subscribers, but it's also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law.

Alex Hardiman (00:00:40):
When you're a product manager, you're involved again in driving specific metrics like engagement or subscribers, but you're also trying to help stories find their real audience in ways that trigger just this whole different side of mission and purpose driven impact. I didn't feel that when I was at a place like Facebook.

Lenny (00:01:00):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Alex Hardiman. Alex is Chief Product Officer at the New York Times where she leads teams that build the company's news, cooking, games, audio, and advertising products. Prior to this role, she was Chief Product Officer at The Atlantic, and before that, she spent two years at Facebook where she led their news product amongst other things. As you'll hear in our conversation, Alex has been at the center of the storm so many times, including at Facebook right after the 2016 election.

Lenny (00:01:33):
Then, at the New York Times right as COVID hit. She hears so many stories and insights about how the New York Times builds product, what it's like for product teams to work with journalists, what's good and bad about working at a company like the New York Times versus FAANG tech type company, and also how they went about acquiring and integrating world. I had such a blast doing this interview and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did. With that, I bring you Alex Hardiman. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly.

Lenny (00:02:19):
That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually use Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, slide reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with pen tool or put their own images or mockups right into the Miro board. With one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks.

Lenny (00:02:57):
Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman. I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens.

Lenny (00:03:48):
I like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently, they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. Three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.

Lenny (00:04:25):
To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting Vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Alex, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Alex Hardiman (00:04:52):
Thanks so much, Lenny. It's really awesome to be here with you.

Lenny (00:04:55):
What's interesting is I think you may be the first product leader on this podcast who doesn't work at a big tech FAANG startup, and so I'm really excited to just dig into see what it's like to build product at a company like the New York Times.

Alex Hardiman (00:05:08):
Thank you. No, no, that sounds awesome. Let's dive right in.

Lenny (00:05:12):
Okay, before we dive in, I'd love to get a little bit of background on just your career. I'm curious, what was your career path to becoming the chief product officer at the New York Times?

Alex Hardiman (00:05:23):
Thanks for asking. I've definitely spent most of my career right at the intersection of journalism and tech. I think in hindsight, if you were to ask my family, they probably wouldn't be that surprised, even though for me I was just rolling with it and following what felt like a really interesting set of problems to solve. But when I just look at my family, there is a ton of journalism in our DNA. My grandfather was a news anchor on the West Coast and I really revered him. My great-grandmother, she was pretty amazing. She actually started one of the first TV stations in the Midwest back in the '50s when it was still pioneering territory.

Alex Hardiman (00:06:01):
For me, one of my first, the dream for me was to try to find a way to build things in the new space. That's how I first ended up at The New York Times. I've had two stints at The New York Times. My first stint was for a decade, from 2000 to 2016, and it was during a really interesting time of pretty big transformation. There's so much to talk about within that decade, but I would say there are two really big things that happened in that moment. The first was really trying to work with the company to shift from being a print first product into a mobile first product. If you go back to 2006 and you think about it, the Times had no mobile presence whatsoever.

Alex Hardiman (00:06:40):
Even the iPhone 2G and the App Store didn't come out I think until like 2008. We just really started investing in small mobile use cases, first on the margins and then more and more aggressively until we were just leading with mobile in everything that we did. New journalism formats, new product features, new revenue opportunities, that type of thing. Then, the second big thing that marked my journey at The New York Times was the shift to a direct to consumer subscription model. This was back in 2011, and there was just a lot of skepticism, including from people at The New York Times, about whether or not people would pay for quality journalism.

Alex Hardiman (00:07:17):
We brought in consultants and they said, "Maybe over the course of history it'll get to one million subscribers, if you're lucky." It felt like a really big nervous [inaudible 00:07:27] at the time. But thank goodness it helped make a market for paid journalism, that has really helped a lot of news organizations find new ways to support quality coverage. But after a decade I did what I think a lot of people did, was you look around and you say, "I love what I do, but I would love to go learn how to do product in the context of a product led digital first company." That's when I went to Facebook and I left in 2016.

Alex Hardiman (00:07:52):
The timing is actually pretty important in terms of my experience at Facebook, because when I first joined Facebook, I totally left the media space. I was focused on building out a team that was really trying to help micro sellers in markets like India and other parts of APAC, who were coming online for the first time in really low bandwidth areas, and just wanted to sell their goods through social commerce. Really looking at what WhatsApp and Line and other regional competitors were doing. We were focused on business messaging and the interoperability of the Facebook apps from more of a small business perspective. It was really awesome work.

Alex Hardiman (00:08:28):
Then, the 2016 presidential election happened. I had only been there for a couple of months and as has been discussed very widely and reported widely, it was a wild time where there was just so much reckoning around misinformation, disinformation, election integrity, platform responsibility. I went over very quickly to help out on the news front where I led the product and engineering teams and it was really hard, really interesting work. I did that for a couple of years, decided-

Lenny (00:08:58):
Before we move on.

Alex Hardiman (00:09:00):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:00):
I'm curious. Okay. Wait, you were leading the news product at Facebook during the election?

Alex Hardiman (00:09:03):
Right after the election.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Right after the election, after everyone was coming after Facebook trying to tear it down?

Alex Hardiman (00:09:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:09):
Wow. What year was that?

Alex Hardiman (00:09:13):
I joined in early 2017 on that effort. The election was November, 2016.

Lenny (00:09:19):
Oh, my God. Before you move on, just what was that like? I don't know how one can describe that experience, but what do you think about when you think back to that time?

Alex Hardiman (00:09:28):
I think about wartime product management, right? You're coming in, and I think there was ... What I appreciated about that time inside of Facebook was that there was just this incredible humility that was needed to really understand and first diagnose what was actually happening on the platform, and the approach to content on Facebook historically it was very binary. You basically had content from friends and family and then you had public contents. Public content could come from anywhere. It could come from a reputable news organization or it could come from my younger brother posting something and declaring it to be true.

Alex Hardiman (00:10:06):
What we really tried to do very quickly was try to unpack the categories of public content to say that there actually is something that is factually accurate information, and that requires a certain craft from the journalistic trade. There are ways to really look at what is trusted information, how you make that a little bit more essential and visible to people on the platform, while then reducing things that are at best dubious or at worse truly misleading propaganda. It was really fascinating and really hard just because the platform hadn't been built to think about classification of coverage in that way.

Alex Hardiman (00:10:44):
Let alone to have the right goals and responsibilities and incentives. There was just a ton of work to figure out how to make the platform far safer and far more informative after, I would say, a pretty intense election cycle.

Lenny (00:10:58):
Yeah. I was going to ask you about this later, but I feel like you're drawn towards just crazy, wild and crazy center of the storm roles. I guess that one you didn't expect necessarily to become that. I imagine The New York Times has a lot of that, but maybe a quick question there. What have you learned about just living in a world of just constant chaos and stress and urgency, endless urgency?

Alex Hardiman (00:11:21):
I would say, if you did ask my family and my husband, he would say that I'm always attracted to the more chaotic problems. I just actually think that that's where product people thrive. The idea of being able to take all of these crazy inputs, trying to create a very structured model to figure out, "Okay, what is true? Where do we have conviction? Where do we have questions? What are the most important problems to solve? How do you prioritize? How do you get a team rallied around a shared context in one single goal? These are actually the conditions where product manager, I think, thrive.

Alex Hardiman (00:11:55):
For me, just having been in the journalism space for about two decades now, it's just been or the tech space around news, it's just been a constant set of upheaval and transformation. Some things within our control, some things entirely outside of our control, and so I love it. For me, there's nothing else I'd rather be doing than trying to solve these problems in the world at scale. But it does take a certain amount of just grit and resilience, and the ability to really focus on the most important problems in a given moment. Also, the ability to let other things slide when you have to.

Alex Hardiman (00:12:32):
But again, I feel like these are core product skills that we look for in terms of leadership and grit, and the ability to drive through really, really tough problems that there's no playbook for, nobody has ever really done before.

Lenny (00:12:43):
Yeah. You said PMs thrive in this. I think some do. Some are like, "No, leave me out of that."

Alex Hardiman (00:12:48):
I guess that's true.

Lenny (00:12:50):
There's a metaphor I like to use when I give PM's advice on where to work within a company, which is there's like the Eye of Sauron, which is the number one most important thing to the CEO at that time. My advice is often don't avoid that thing, usually, but work maybe to the side of that because you don't want to work on something that doesn't matter, that's like over in the shire land. You want to be something that matters but not maybe the most important thing. I feel like you're the opposite. You're like, "Where's the Eye of Sauron focused? I'm going to go there and build stuff." That's pretty awesome.

Alex Hardiman (00:13:20):
Awesome, sometimes, I'm sure there are moments too where it would be nice to chill, but I am drawn to those types of problems for sure. This feels like therapy, Lenny. I'm into it.

Lenny (00:13:31):
Tell me about your mother.

Alex Hardiman (00:13:34):
She's wonderful.

Lenny (00:13:37):
Okay, great. That's the end of that one. I'll let you finish your career overview and then-

Alex Hardiman (00:13:42):
I feel like we're almost at present, which is I found that there was so much incredible experience that I was able to soak up and lean at a place like Facebook. For me, I really wanted to figure out how to apply that back into organizations that just had more of a classic journalistic mission and purpose, so I went to the Atlantic for a year. They had just been purchased by the Emerson Collective, so it was a really fun moment of just investment and expansion and ambition. We launched their consumer business. Then, I came back to The New York Times in late 2019, right before the pandemic, and I've been there ever since.

Lenny (00:14:19):
Oh my, just your timing is impeccable every time.

Alex Hardiman (00:14:22):
It really is.

Lenny (00:14:24):
I was doing some research on you before this chat and when you came back to The New York Times, there's all these stories about how big of a deal it was. Returns to The New York Times. That must have been something coming back, because you're there for 10 years initially, and then you came back. What was that experience like just coming back to something like that after being away?

Alex Hardiman (00:14:43):
I felt really lucky. When I left The New York Times back in 2016, it was on really, really good terms. It almost felt as like, I'm going on an externship and I really hope that one day I'll be able to come back and just do my job better. Because I do think there's real value in being able to do product in a bunch of different contexts. You're just so much better at pattern recognition, learning how to solve a diversity of problems, learning to work through things. I had a lot of great support when I left, which was really important. I don't think everyone necessarily has the privilege of that support when they exit a company. When I came back, it was just a real moment of excitement. My interview process, I joked with my boss at the time. But it did actually feel more like therapy.

Alex Hardiman (00:15:30):
When you've worked with people for a decade before and you go in, the conversation isn't the normal list of interview questions. It's like, "Okay, here's what type of leader you were a couple of years ago. Here are the conditions on the ground now, how do you feel about X? How do you feel about Y? Are you still passionate about solving this? What else have you learned that's going to make you better?" It was wonderful. It was one of the best interview processes because you're talking to a bunch of people who knew what you were like when you were leading as a person at a different point in your career and they're pushing you to be better. I felt like I got the best chance of a lifetime to come back and try to do my job better than I had been able to do it before, and that's pretty cool.

Lenny (00:16:12):
You've been there three years at this point?

Alex Hardiman (00:16:14):
Yeah, three years on Halloween, so coming up very soon.

Lenny (00:16:18):
Oh, wow. That's three days from now when we're recording. I wonder when this comes out. I'm curious, at a company like New York Times, which is, I imagine people think when they think product, they think it's the newspaper. At Airbnb we have this challenge where when we talk to hosts, "Here's the product." You're like, "What is your product? Is it our homes?" You have to help people understand, "Okay, when we talk product, we mean the website and app." What do you think of the product at The New York Times? Then, is it a challenge to help people understand, here's what the product team does?

Alex Hardiman (00:16:46):
It's a really good question. At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them. For about 150 years, our product was pretty simple. It was a printed newspaper, which is still very beloved today, but the UX of the newspaper was, it was a predictable structure. It was a very finite amount of news. It was time bound, which I think is a really lovely thing in terms of setting expectation. It also has the packaging of the newspaper just such serendipity, where you can move across news, opinion, culture, games.

Alex Hardiman (00:17:31):
It's a really great bounded product in and of itself. But about 25 years ago, when we started shifting over to digital, the web, and mobile, the world just fully opened up in a way. We just saw this really tremendous disaggregation and distribution of our journalism. We really tried to meet the moment by building a wide array of products in the news space to extend our reach. Our products then, our digital products were our website, our apps, newsletters, we dabbled with a lot in the VR/AR space early on. That was, I would say, the first big extension of our products. When we then pivoted though to a subscription model, it was a really interesting moment where we actually had to take more of a destination first approach.

Alex Hardiman (00:18:15):
It was almost like the beginning of us rebundling all of what we did, but on our own destination again, in digital destination. Because in order to build a really thriving subscription business, you really need a direct relationship with your customer as opposed to just relying on platforms to really distribute your coverage. That's where, again, we really started rebundling the breadth and depth of value that people once found in the Sunday newspaper at digital scale. Now, today, our product bundle includes even so much more than news, which I hope we'll talk about a little bit more later. We've really scaled our products in a bunch of different categories where we feel like we can really help people understand and engage with the world.

Alex Hardiman (00:18:57):
We have cooking, we have games, we have sports, we have Wirecutter, which is a great innovation surface. We're playing with a new audio app all around audio journalism. We have now six fully fledged different product destinations. The next thing for us to do is to really figure out how to put those together into a bundle that really becomes the essential subscription for any curious English speaking person around the world, who really wants to know what's happening and wants to be able to, again, act and engage and make great decisions based on the products that we build.

Lenny (00:19:36):
Got it. It sounds like the strategy is a subscription bundle where you just keep bundling awesome stuff into this bundle. It's an obvious thing everyone has, whether you want cooking or games or The New York Times online.

Alex Hardiman (00:19:48):
I think that's right. We did this pretty great exercise and strategy projects over the last year. We took a look and we said, "What is the largest addressable market where The New York Times can be truly valuable every single day to a group of people?" What we found was that there are about 135 million people around the world we believe are willing to pay for the type of high quality journalism based products that the New York Times produces, in the categories of news, gameplay, cooking and recipes, sports, which is why we acquired the athletic shopping recommendations and audio. In order for us to really capture as much of that audience and really serve them well, there are really three things that we need to do to make that essential subscription work.

Alex Hardiman (00:20:37):
The first is we absolutely need to have the best news destination in the world. When you think about the New York Times, we actually have the solar system metaphor where for us news is the sun in the sense that it's why we exist. It is what gives us our brand heritage and reputation. It's what instills trust. It's also where we just have the largest audience when you think about a funnel for our portfolio, and it's also where we just have the most amount of high quality coverage. But then that sun helps you give birth to other satellite planets or products that have a lot of the same DNA. Again, like great trusted journalism, great journalists who just have real expertise.

Alex Hardiman (00:21:16):
A great product experience that allows you to really unlock that value distribution reach, and the other ingredients that you would need for successful products to work. We're really focused on building out beyond news products that really help people engage with their passions and life needs that go beyond news. Then, the third thing is what you're describing as the bundle, how do we create a connected family of products that puts all of those things together so that wherever you come into the New York Times, to news or maybe through Wordle, you know that you're having the best experience within that category.

Alex Hardiman (00:21:49):
But then you also can quickly experience and discover everything else that we offer. That's the strategy and the vision, and it's a huge ambition. We want to get to 15 million subscribers by 2027. We're just over 9 million today, and I really think we can do it.

Lenny (00:22:06):
Awesome. I actually wanted to chat about goals and how you think about success as a product team. I imagine the north star metric is what you just said, which is subscribers. If that's true, what other goals do you have across teams? Maybe even further, I'm packing a lot of questions into one question, but I'm curious just how your product team looks. How many PMs do you have? Roughly, how do you structure the teams? Then, roughly, what kind of goals do they all have to try and imagine the product team at New York Times?

Alex Hardiman (00:22:34):
Let's start with structure. First, I love this question talking about my team because I love hyping them. They're amazing, and our success is truly only as good as our people. Yeah, it is so true. For us, when we think about our org structure, the way to set that up so that our people can really do their best work is that we have two axis. We have functions and then we have missions. I oversee two functions, which is the functions of product and design. The functions themselves, it's normal of what you would find in terms of functional responsibilities. We focus on standards of craft and excellence, career growth, career frameworks, equitable promotion processes, community of practices, skill development, all of that.

Alex Hardiman (00:23:21):
But missions is where a lot of the work happens. These are cross-functional teams, very similar to what we had at a place like Facebook. These cross-functional teams are led by usually a general manager, a product leader, or an engineering leader. They're all pursuing the same high level goals and objectives. Cross-functional missions at the Times, it can include a lot of the same skill sets that you would find at a tech company, PMs, engineers, designers, data scientists, researchers, product marketers. But the big difference is we also have editors, if it's a product space that directly shapes our journalism. I can talk more about that because it's a pretty interesting differentiating factor.

Lenny (00:24:02):
Yeah, that's super interesting. There's a journalist within cross-functional product teams?

Alex Hardiman (00:24:05):
Exactly. But we have three different types of missions. We have consumer missions, we have monetization missions, and we have platform missions. Editors are embedded within consumer missions. Those are the missions that I oversee, where we're focused on creating really great products, again, in categories like news, cooking, games, audio, et cetera. That is where having editors involved, particularly like editors who are very product minded, it brings in the best of their expertise and marries it with a lot of the normal signal that you look for in terms of data research and other insights. When you're trying to make sure that you understand a consumer problem and that you're really finding the best creative solution for it.

Lenny (00:24:48):
Cool.

Alex Hardiman (00:24:49):
It is really cool. It's one of the, I think, most gratifying parts of working at a news organization like the Times. But if you work on a different mission, like a monetization mission, we have two really big ones. One is subscriber growth, the other one that's also really important is digital advertising. They build centralized commercial products that we can then scale across all of the products in our bundle. The subscriber growth team, for instance, they look at making sure that we have really great account ID management for subscribers. If you're buying a subscription through games or through news. Or, if you're on the digital advertising team, you're trying to make sure that we have a first party data program that's really privacy safe, that works as well in cooking as it does in the news space.

Alex Hardiman (00:25:33):
Then, there's a totally different third bucket of mission that we have, which is all of our platform teams. This is everything from monetization platforms like our commerce engine, which is so important, because we're a subscription business, to data platforms where you might have our ML platform or experimentation tooling, to just basic infrastructure. Those are shared across the bundle, which just really helps make it so much easier, more efficient for really engineers to ship code and do their best work. A lot of this actually, I think, probably is pretty familiar to how you might organize at a tech company minus the editors.

Lenny (00:26:14):
Awesome. On that info piece, that reminds me of something I definitely wanted to talk about, which is something New York Times is really known for is the visualizations and these immersive stories that you all put out. I'm so curious just how that gets done. I feel like if I was on a product team at a regular, like a big tech FAANG company, I'd be like, "Shit, all these ad hoc things I got to do for all these stories, such a pain in the butt." That's so important to the New York Times and the online experience. I'm curious just like what is it like to build these things, say the election widgets, and all of that stuff?

Lenny (00:26:47):
Then, I don't know, I was just reading a story about climate change and it's this really beautiful immersive story of just what is happening with the world. There's a bunch of questions there, but I guess roughly just how does that get done, something like that?

Alex Hardiman (00:27:01):
Well, first, thanks for saying that. I really appreciate it. I do think there's something really special about some of the ways that we marry the journalism and the presentation. I want to start just by giving credit where credit's due, which is I think some of the most interesting and inventive and compelling formats, they actually do start off as one-off experiments that are spun up in the newsroom by embedded teams that we have within graphics, visual journalism, interactive news teams. This is where we have editors, journalists, engineers, data scientists, designers, literally all hunkered down together focusing on how to make one story come to life in the best possible way.

Lenny (00:27:37):
Who has the idea usually? Is it like the journalists working on that, they're like, "Hey, I think we should make something really great."

Alex Hardiman (00:27:42):
Exactly. Yeah, one of the things ... We have a newsroom of over 2000 people. You basically have people who've been experts on certain beats like climate, for instance, for decades. They have the nugget of the idea. They start to do reporting and then they really pull in others from visuals, from interactive just to say, "How can I really make sure that I can tell this story with as much impact and weight as possible?" That's where the magic starts to happen, when you pull in all of those other skill sets together to help dream up how that story might be told.

Lenny (00:28:18):
They're like, "Alex, we need one of these for our story. Can you get us on the list?" How does that process go?

Alex Hardiman (00:28:26):
No, no, no. These are teams that are really autonomous in the newsroom. For one-off, truly special features, I'll give you an example of one that I found to be particularly powerful. I don't know if you read Jodi Kantor, who is one of our ... a really incredible investigative reporter. You might know for some of her work that she did around MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, in that investigation.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Yeah.

Alex Hardiman (00:28:47):
She recently did a piece on how employers are tracking and monitoring remote workers with tools like productivity scores. The story itself was designed to show a person's own productivity score in the moment as they read the article.

Lenny (00:29:02):
Oh, shit.

Alex Hardiman (00:29:02):
It was super visceral, really creepy in the most effective way. In my mind, that's the type of magical experience that only happens when you actually have dedicated designers, engineers, and others who can really sit down with a reporter to say, "Let's figure out how to shape that story in the most magical way." The speed of news is so fast that you don't have time to mess with roadmaps. We really have teams who are freed up from some of the normal processes around that, so they can really just focus on storytelling for really big stories and pieces. But on top of that, what we do have is a storytelling product team. What they do is they really take notice of things that are starting to work in more of the experimental phase, some of these one-offs.

Alex Hardiman (00:29:50):
Then, they work closely with editors to test and find product market fit for new formats that can actually scale across many parts of the report, so that over time when you open the app, the app is more accessible, more engaging, because we still have the traditional story based article, but we're also shifting more of the distribution of stories into video, into visuals, into live. If you even look at live, we've broken out of the tyranny of the article in many ways, where you have live reporter updates that are the size of length of tweets. People filing from the ground in Ukraine, trying to give you a sense of what's happening in a very immediate and real way.

Alex Hardiman (00:30:31):
That's where we do have teams, product teams who have to think in two modes. First, they have to be able to think in the moment with editors, where you might not always have all the right data at your fingertips and you just have to make a call, like, "What is the best experience to tell this story in a really truthful, accurate, accessible way?" Then, the other mode is when they're not shipping at the speed of news, they're trying to build end to end systems so that we're building the tooling to actually create the stories at the same time as the consumer experience, which is a totally different mode of system level thinking.

Alex Hardiman (00:31:04):
It's a very cool space. That product team is, they're pulling off some pretty incredible work because they can operate in those two modes. It's like, in the moment, in the moment of the story, but also trying to build the systems that allow you to reshape the composition of storytelling formats that we have across our products over time.

Lenny (00:31:23):
That is super cool. What percentage of these fancy stories are using that platform and building on something that already exists versus a one-off experiment would you say roughly?

Alex Hardiman (00:31:32):
The majority are on our platforms hands down. Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:36):
Okay. That makes sense. Then, just so I understand, so you said Jodi was the journalist?

Alex Hardiman (00:31:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:41):
You mentioned. Does she has a product team dedicated to her work?

Alex Hardiman (00:31:45):
No, what we have is we have a centralized interactive news team, graphics team, data journalism team. Those editors partner with different journalists when they have really big stories to help bring their story to life.

Lenny (00:32:00):
I see. Do they have to come to this team and be like, "Hey, I'd love your time." How does that prioritization ... Because I imagine a lot of journalists are coming to them like, "Hey, my story is going to be awesome. We need you."

Alex Hardiman (00:32:10):
You know what? To be totally honest, I'm not involved. Somehow it works.

Lenny (00:32:19):
That's a great leadership sign. It just works and you set it up and it's working, so that's great.

Alex Hardiman (00:32:25):
Well, and the newsroom has set it up and something that is just, again, very interesting about the way that we are set up is that we have our newsroom and then we have our business side. The business side is where you have all of the product teams and there is intense collaboration between the two, but they do have different leadership structures because that's how we maintain the independence of our coverage. Our product teams sit within the newsroom if they're focused on storytelling, live, anything related to the coverage.

Alex Hardiman (00:32:54):
The only distinction really that I think I'm trying to make is that product teams really help stories find their widest audience and be as engaging and as impactful as can be. But product teams don't have any influence over the selection of the stories. That is what the newsroom retains as editorial.

Lenny (00:33:14):
Okay. You mentioned Wordle and you all acquired Wordle recently. I'm just curious what that was all like. I imagine it's still being integrated. Were you involved in the exploration and purchase process and what went on there?

Alex Hardiman (00:33:28):
Wordle has been such a fun ride. Maybe I'll first just bring you behind the scenes on how the deal came to be, and then we can talk a little bit more about what the integration process has been like.

Lenny (00:33:37):
Yeah, sounds great.

Alex Hardiman (00:33:37):
I first heard about Wordle in early January because a New York Times reporter, Daniel Victor, actually wrote a piece about Josh Wardle, who's a software engineer in Brooklyn, and how he had created the game. It really is this gesture of love for his partner, and I certainly wasn't the only person to read through that column. Everyone inside the New York Times perked up. I remember reaching out to Jonathan Knight, who's the general manager of games, he's on my team. He had already taken notice well before the piece was published, and he had already reached out to Josh to see if he would be interested in having games join our portfolio.

Alex Hardiman (00:34:16):
We just all loved Wordle immediately because if you've played it, it shares a lot of the DNA of other really successful word games that we have at the New York Times, like Spelling Bee or the Crossword Mini. If anything, Josh was really forthright that he created it because he was inspired by those games. Then, in the context of just our subscription strategy, games is such an important category for us. We really see games and demand for games as this, basically, it's a counterpoint to the news. It gives people a chance to actually take a break. It's fun. It doesn't feel like empty calories. It's really time well spent.

Alex Hardiman (00:34:54):
We were just thinking of Wordle as such a wonderful addition to our games franchise to really give people more reasons to feel like they had a relationship with the New York Times every day. The whole thesis of the acquisition just made so much sense. Our team just very quickly engaged with Josh and the acquisition talks were incredibly fast. The whole thing took place in a matter of weeks, which is way faster than any other acquisition I've been a part of. It was a very amicable process. We were just super delighted to bring Wordle on board, but it happened in record speed.

Lenny (00:35:27):
Well, yeah, it felt fast from the outside too. It became a huge deal. Then, "Okay, New York Times buys them." Yeah, it's impressive. You said you acquired Athletic. How often are you acquiring companies?

# Scripts for navigating difficult conversations | Alisa Cohn (executive coach)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations, where like in performance review season, what do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion?

Alisa Cohn (00:00:10):
Hope for the future is so important. I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. It's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here, and so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy.

Alisa Cohn (00:00:29):
They're trying now to be the leader who everyone loves, but what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. This employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job, you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them. You don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out. Ultimately, that leads to the demise of your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
You have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end the meeting.

Alisa Cohn (00:00:54):
My three questions to end the meeting are...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today my guest is Alisa Cohn. Alisa is an executive coach who has worked with C-suite execs at both startups like Etsy, Wirecutter, Venmo, and DraftKings, along with Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and the New York Times. She was named one of the top 50 coaches in the world by Thinkers50 and the number one startup coach for the past four years by Global Gurus. What I love about Alisa is that she gives her clients very specific and actionable advice. In her conversation, Alisa shares specific language and phrases that you can use when having a difficult conversation with your reports to make these conversations go much smoother and be less difficult. Also, three questions you should ask at the end of every meeting to make the most possible forward progress after each meeting. Plus, why your job as a leader isn't to make people happy and what you should be focused on instead, and a set of questions that she calls the founder prenup that you should talk through with potential founders to make sure that these are the people that you want to be working with for a long, long time.

(00:01:59):
There's also so much more advice. If you're a leader of people or a founder, and especially if you dread hard conversations, this episode is for you.

Alisa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Alisa Cohn (00:04:54):
Lenny, it's so great to be here and thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
I want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations. I personally dread difficult conversations. I feel like I practice ahead of these things. I'm like, "I'm going to say these things. It's going to go like this," and it never goes as well as I hope. I always say the wrong thing. I feel like this is very relatable. They're called difficult conversations for a reason.

Alisa Cohn (00:05:18):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
I know you work with a lot of execs on this specifically, and what I love is you've actually come up with a bunch of scripts that help people make these conversations less difficult. So how about we talk through some of these scripts that people can actually start applying?

Alisa Cohn (00:05:32):
Let's do that. I love that idea. And also Lenny, as you just said, very relatable and also, so you're not alone. If I could ask you a question, if you're picturing a difficult conversation that you have had, should have, might have, and you're nervous about, it's hard for you, can you sum it up? What's hard about it? Because it's helpful to clarify what is hard about it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:56):
Great question. I just don't want to make people sad and upset, and I worry about their reaction, how to deal with that, and them just getting really upset and mad and just like, "Oh, man. This really made things worse." So I worry about the reaction, I guess.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:11):
Okay, about making things worse or about their reaction?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):
The reaction, just making someone upset and sad. I don't want to do that.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:17):
Making someone upset. Okay, good. And again, you're not alone about that. Just one more question on that. What's the problem if they're sad and upset? What does that mean to you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):
Oh, I love this life coaching we're doing. Yeah, so it's like what happens if they get sad and upset?

Alisa Cohn (00:06:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):
I feel like it's stuff that I'm going to have to deal with. It's like this drama all of a sudden, this new fire I have to think about. And yeah, it's like the additional work it creates and also just, I don't know. Yeah, it's a good question.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:48):
You can think about it some more, right? I'm not going to put you on the spot right now, but just to say for all of us, the reason they're difficult, to your point, they're difficult. But we're putting meaning on things all the time, every day, all the time, and I think it's important, it's actually helpful in motivating you to have difficult conversations, but also in helping them go well. If you can get to the bottom of what you're putting on top of it, what you're weighting it with, because I can understand that again, you are not alone. I don't want to make people upset. Totally.

(00:07:20):
And also, I would just say on the other hand, when you're enlightening someone or you're working out a situation with someone and it's difficult, if you don't give them the opportunity to hear what you have to say, if you don't bring this up, then you're never going to have the opportunity to help them see something differently or help them improve or help you improve the relationship or whatever it is you're trying to do. And so, I can understand it's a natural thing. I don't want to make them upset.

(00:07:51):
No one wants to make anybody upset, but through that upset on the other side of that, can often be a whole new possibility and a whole new revelation, and actually a lot of joy and freedom. I think that we forget about all the other possibilities that come out of difficult conversations and we just land on these really uncomfortable parts about like, "oh, it's going to be a lot of extra work" or like, "They're going to get uncomfortable or even maybe cry." And I think it's just really helpful to tap into what you make it mean and then also what other possibilities it could mean.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):
I love that. And it's one thing to hear that and say that, it's another to actually feel that deeply and feel like I shouldn't be as worried as I am. I think part of it is doing these enough times where you're like, "Okay, it's actually not so hard." And the other is having some of this support. To make this even more real, let's give some examples of what we say when we say difficult conversations. There's like, "You're not getting a promotion that you thought you would, we're going to let you go." What other examples or common difficult conversations that you run across?

Alisa Cohn (00:08:50):
Those are two very common ones. And then of course, the most common one is just difficult performance feedback. Or [inaudible 00:08:56] what we say, quote unquote, "constructive performance feedback," which we never made positive. It only is the sort of things that you're not doing well. I think there are two flavors of that. One is, "You're screwing up" and the other is, "Developmentally, I'd like to see you add something or change something."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):
Yes. And as you say that, one of the other fears I have is them just disagreeing and me feeling like maybe it's not right, maybe I'm wrong and feeling shit maybe. I didn't see something and then just looking worse after the whole thing.

Alisa Cohn (00:09:27):
Yeah. And so then I think what's also really helpful to, and part of the process that we can talk about this for sure is getting a difficult conversation is number one, tapping into what's uncomfortable for it, for you, about it. And then number two, also getting your mindset right. So to say the obvious, are you doing this to hurt someone's feelings? No, never, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:49):
The opposite.

Alisa Cohn (00:09:50):
That's not the reason that anyone's doing it. Sometimes people are giving the performance feedback or talking about something that's been bothering them in order to express themselves and vent. And actually, that is very helpful to identify for yourself, that's why I'm doing it. And then, maybe not do it then, until you can transform your reasoning. But at the end of the day, the hope is as a manager, the reason that you're giving someone this so-called constructive feedback is because you're helping them get better. You need them to change the behavior. They'll never get promoted if they keep doing that. They'll never be successful if they keep doing that. And so, it's your job as a leader and as a manager, to help them out of that problem and help them do something different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):
The best story I've heard to make that really real for me, I think it was Kim Scott when she came on the podcast. She told a story of, I think it was Bob, where everyone just knew he was terrible and it was like, everyone's was just like knew he was not good and eventually, the boss had a conversation with him eight months into it and told him, "It's not going to work out. You're just doing a bad job." And he's like, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I didn't realize that. If you told me, I would've changed." And everyone assumed he knew. And so I think to your point, this is to help the person. It's not not to hurt them.

Alisa Cohn (00:11:05):
Yeah, a hundred percent. One of my clients, he was running a division and one of his people was not doing it right, not doing it right, not getting the right kind of data, not having to do the right kind of analysis, whatever it was. We were talking about it and I said, "Well, how come you have another feedback with her?" And he said, "You know, she's just going to cry. She's just going to cry. She's older, whatever, she's just going to cry. It's going to be too uncomfortable, whatever." So we worked, we talked and talked and talked. I gave him a script. We really worked it out and he agreed that he would go in and have that conversation with her, which he did.

(00:11:40):
And he reported back to me and he was shaken. She cried. Of course she did. She cried. That's what he knew she was going to do. And so she was upset and she went home early and the whole thing. The next day she came in and she said, "Thank you so much for telling me that. I wish someone had told me that 15 years ago. I think I could have had a different career." And I think that is so meaningful for all leaders and people who are responsible for other people to understand that you're uncomfortable when they start crying, of course, or they have this difficult reaction or whatever. But honestly, the only way you're going to be able to help someone grow in their career and become the best person they can be is by leaning into these tough conversations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):
What I love about the scripts we're going to talk about, which we probably should transition to, is it's again, one thing to hear that and be like, "Yes, okay, I need to do this. I need to get better at typical conversations. I need to have that talk without someone that we should let go." It's another when it's like tomorrow is the meeting and you're like, "Oh, my God. I have to have this conversation now." And so, I love that you actually give people a really simple approach to how to lay this stuff out in various different contexts. So let's talk through some of these approaches and scripts you've come up with. What do you think would be a good one to start with?

Alisa Cohn (00:12:55):
Well, we can start with performance feedback and we can just sort of take a typical example. So first of all, once you've done your work to get your mindset right to kind of know what you're doing it, and then you just really want to really be able to wrap your mouth around the words. So what that looks like is practicing, and the script could be, "You know, Matilda, I want to chat with you about the way you're interacting with your peers. So what I'm hearing from them is that you're missing deadlines on a regular basis and not letting them know you're missing the deadlines, and that also you're not fully keeping your team up to speed.

(00:13:27):
And so they're kind of confused running around. Now, we both know that the most important way you can be successful here and also achieve your goals is to make sure that you are working with your peers in a way that's consistent and that they can count on you and you can count on them. So I wanted to let you know about this. I want to certainly hear what you have to say, but the most important thing is that we leave this discussion knowing how you're going to make sure that you're keeping your peers in the loop and also your team in the loop."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):
Yeah, there's so many elements there that are really interesting. Just focusing on what I'm hearing versus just coming from you or something you've done wrong. It's, here's what I'm hearing from multiple sources. I think that helps people. Okay, it's not just you and just like, "Oh, my manager hates me."

Alisa Cohn (00:13:56):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:14):
It's like, "Okay, other people are saying this." And then I love this phrase of, we both know where it's not just me telling you this. It's like, "You also know this. I know you're smart and you also know that this is, something is wrong here." And then this goal of, here's what we need to [inaudible 00:14:31]. You're like very clear call to action, almost action item, like leave this meeting with, "Let's just be aligned on this thing."

Alisa Cohn (00:14:36):
Yeah, thanks for calling those out. I hope, and again, what I'm trying to convey in my tone is also, "You know what? It's Tuesday. We got to have this conversation. I'm sure it's going to end well. I'm not mad." The whole point about my manager hates me, right? "I'm not yelling at you." The more even keeled and even matter of fact you can be about something that's kind of just run-of-the-mill feedback, the better. And I think it's just also what I didn't say before, and I think it's also important is that, as you are recognizing that one of your jobs is to give this feedback, is that you have to build a relationship with people so they can hear you through the lens of, "Oh, Alisa wants to help me." Not, "Oh, Alisa hates me. It's always a problem."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):
How did you start that phrase again? Because the starting is always the hardest part for me. How do you kick off the conversation? What was the couple sentences used?

Alisa Cohn (00:15:28):
I wanted to have a conversation with you about some things I've been hearing from your peers about the way that you all are interacting together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Awesome. So there's an element of, don't make it feel like a huge deal. Just like, "I want to have this conversation with you about something." And it's just like, "Let's have this conversation and here's what we want to leave this conversation with."

Alisa Cohn (00:15:46):
Yes. And I can't stress enough that it's actually really helpful to also have spent some time with Matilda or whoever saying, "Great job on the way that project landed." Or, "Hey, launches, when they happen on time and they're smooth, sometimes we don't notice anything. I want you to notice, we didn't notice anything. That's fantastic. You did a good job in that launch," or whatever it is. Because then, you've had the conversation with them to give them positive feedback and point out what's working, that builds the relationship so that you have the lens of, "Oh, yeah. When something's working, they tell me. When something's not working, they tell me, too." That's how you build trust as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):
They want to be criticizing them [inaudible 00:16:25]. We need to have another conversation what we're hearing about, problems [inaudible 00:16:28].

Alisa Cohn (00:16:27):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:29):
Obviously, if you say it the same way every single time, they're going to feel like this is weird. Do you recommend it's this kind of Mad Libs approach or is it make it your own as much as you can? What are kind of the key? Or is it like, here's actually how you want to say it every time?

Alisa Cohn (00:16:42):
In my book and when I work with my clients, I give specific scripts and what I will regularly say when I'm working with my clients is, "Okay, so this is how I would do it," and then I'll land it for them. But they have to make it their own. You always have to make it your own and I don't think it's a problem of doing it the same way every time. It's not like people are going to notice you because you're talking about different topics, theoretically. If you have a formula that can work for you, that's going to motivate you to do it, that is what's important. And what's important is that it's neutral, not loading on or not venting on someone and not unloading on someone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):
I love that we started with this one because it feels like the most common one of just your employee is underperforming and you want to make sure they understand and adjust. What if you're not hearing something from a bunch of people? What if it's just your perception of their writing? You need to work on your writing skills or you're coming in late. Is there another way you phrase it where it's not, "I'm hearing it from other people?"

Alisa Cohn (00:17:43):
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So I'll talk about writing. I think it would be something like, okay, "Matilda, part of your job is to be able to create these documents and I appreciate that you do them on time. What I've observed is that they can often be not as structured as I'd like them to be and they also lack a conclusion. So what I'd love you to do is look at these three or four examples of some folks who are doing them really well and see if you can model your writing on theirs. If you need to take additional classes or if you need help in any way, let me know. But ultimately, I want to get your writing to the level where everybody is appreciating what you bring to the table because the level of your writing really reflects the level of your thinking."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Mm-hmm. Wow, I like that. I'd want to follow your advice if I got that. So the way you started that is what I've observed, which also is not like, "Here's what I think" or "Here's what you just need to do." It's more like, "Here's what I've noticed, here's what I've seen, here's what I've observed about what you're doing." And then it reminds me of, what is it, nonviolent communication, that whole framework of just focus on what you see, not what is wrong with them, not what they've done. I guess, is there anything there you want to say of just the importance of focusing on what you've heard from people or what you've observed versus maybe what people often do instead?

Alisa Cohn (00:19:05):
Yeah, I mean you just really said it and I think it's such an important point, observable facts. The idea that this is not a judgment. This is not... Sort of as less judgy as possible is also very helpful. It makes it neutral. It's observable facts and it's also sort of based on expectations, right? So the writing is, we expect it to be at a certain level and it's not that way. And here are the reasons it's not, the specific reasons, it's not.

(00:19:35):
The way you interact with your peers, it's important to be at a certain standard, and here's why. Because when we all work together, we're going to be able to execute and when we don't, unfortunately we won't be able to. So you staying in sync with them is important and the observation is that they don't feel fully in sync with you.

(00:19:52):
And so every time we talk about this, it doesn't become this, "Oh, I don't know. I just feel..." By the way, some things you have to give feedback on and they are kind of a feeling and those are more difficult, but so many things if you do the work to really think about what is the observable data, I always ask my clients, what's my evidence that this is happening? And you have to spend some time thinking about it, but it's really worth it because it makes the feedback easier for you to give and easier for them to hear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there anything else along the lines of this specific type of feedback that is worth sharing before we move on to a different type of feedback?

Alisa Cohn (00:20:29):
Well, I think just that the reason, one of the many reasons that people have gone uncomfortable giving feedback is that somebody might get defensive or they might start crying as we talked about. And so I have a script also, which is if someone gets defensive, which is it's like I'm giving you this feedback and you're getting defensive and I say, "Well, let's pause for a second. First of all, I want you to know that I'm telling you this actually, just to make you better because I know how important your career is to you. I know how important the success is to you and it's important to me too as your leader. The second thing is, my observation is that you're getting a little bit emotional. I want to know if we can continue having this conversation now or if we need to kind of pause it. At the end of the day, we really have to have this conversation and I really want to see you make changes, but I understand you might need a few moments to digest it."

(00:21:18):
The importance of that for you is not even what you say, but that you have prepared and you are prepared for if someone has that kind of reaction and that you don't have to, yourself, react to it. You know, "No, I'm not doing that. No, no, no, no, whatever." And you can say, "Yes, you are." Now we're in a fight and that is not cool for anybody. It's certainly not cool for you as a leader. So it gives you the opportunity to recognize that you have another tool in your toolkit rather than just react.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
So if you find yourself feeling defensive or they are just not hearing and just fighting back, the tool is just pause. Let's just pause for a moment and it feels like there's kind of two parts to which you just shared. One is, remind them why this is important to them and why you're talking about this. And then two is, if there's just emotions kind of taking over, give them a chance to like, "Let's just pause and maybe come back to this because maybe you're not in the right state right now to listen."

Alisa Cohn (00:22:18):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):
Sometimes people get upset when you mention like, "You're getting emotional," or I don't know. Is that a thing that you deal with of just like, "How dare you say I'm feeling emotional?" I'm just...

Alisa Cohn (00:22:29):
I'm not emotional. Why do you think [inaudible 00:22:31] emotional? Right, exactly. Yes, of course. Now, when someone's crying, they're obviously getting emotional. When they're defensive, it's possible that you might want to use a different word. I can see that this is really upsetting you or this is really triggering you, or I can see that the temperature between us has just changed. You could say something like that. I do think also it's helpful to know your people because sometimes you could realize that actually they can deal with that, but then sometimes you have to really [inaudible 00:23:00] the delicate words that you need to use to pause the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
Yeah. And I find, to your point, it's helpful to you too as the person giving it. And I feel like sometimes, you may be feeling like I should just pull back and maybe I'm wrong, maybe they're right, maybe I should stop and instead this gives you a chance to know I'm actually, I can't. I need to stay strong about what I believe because I... You put so much thought and effort into this already, it's unlikely you're just like, oh, totally wrong about what you're saying.

Alisa Cohn (00:23:30):
Yeah, exactly. There's something going on. There's something going on. And then also, the whole point about it being a conversation is that actually it's a conversation. Actually, Lenny, if you have a different point of view, I would like to hear it. Let's talk about it, but we can't keep going on like this, where I don't feel I can count on you for whatever it is that we're talking about. So we need to have this conversation and recreate a set of expectations between ourselves. Ultimately, that kind of conversation has the potential to really build the relationship and build trust, and that's another reason I encourage everybody to get over their discomfort and to lean into having these conversations because on the other side of that, is a much better, stronger connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
And especially if you do them well.

Alisa Cohn (00:24:11):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):
Following this advice. So okay, so again, if somebody's feeling defensive, can you again say how you start that, if you notice that? And then I'll highlight the two elements again of the...

Alisa Cohn (00:24:25):
So the way to pause is to actually say, "Let's just pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):
Awesome. And I love, again, just the reminder of here's why this is important to you, here's the benefit to you and why this will help you. And then it's like, "Okay, let's just maybe take a pause and come back to this conversation if you're feeling like this isn't the best time." Awesome. Anything else along that line before we go to another type of a hard conversation?

Alisa Cohn (00:25:02):
I mean, I can talk all day about this [inaudible 00:25:06], but I'm happy to move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:07):
Well, let's pick another topic. I know you have kind of five buckets and types of conversation. Maybe the promotion one. That feels like I think we're in performance review season. It feels like these are happening a bunch. What do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion they expected or wanted?

Alisa Cohn (00:25:24):
Of course that's challenging. So again, getting your mindset right, recognizing they're disappointed, they're going to be disappointed, recognizing how you felt, the time that when you didn't get a promotion or whatever. And so kind of coming to it with some compassion. And also, you have to get your reasoning right. So sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they were here for a year or whatever. Sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they're the only internal candidate who's qualified for this or they might have a sense of themselves succeeding or achieving that is more inflated maybe than you see them. So trying to think about where they're coming from.

(00:25:56):
And then the conversation is just, "Matilda, I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear. I know you were hoping to get that promotion, but I want to let you know that we are going to actually be looking for an external candidate. I want to give you a few thoughts about why. First of all, in discussing this with my peers, I'm realizing that we need someone who has done this role multiple times in the past and has that experience. Number two, I think it's really important that they have an expertise in a specific realm that we've identified as really important. So for those reasons, we're going to bring someone in from the outside, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. Number one, it's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here. And so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance. And then number two, when we bring this person in, I'm committed to finding someone who's a great people leader, who is going to help you build those skills."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):
So a few elements there that stood out to me. One is just being very upfront and not bearing the lead. Telling them very early, "Here's what I've decided." As you said it, I could see my heart sinking immediately when I feel that. So at least that's over and then it's, here's why. And that starts to help you feel like, "Okay, I get it. I understand at least how you thought about this." And then there's the hope for the future, your painting of, here's how I can get there eventually.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:21):
Yes, that hope for the future is so important and I think sometimes we're such in a rush to kind of deliver the bad news that we forget there's a human being over there who needs hope for the future. And hopefully. If they're a good employee, hopefully they have hope for the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
I love that. Is there anything else to that script that you think is really highlighting or do you think I touched on the key elements?

Alisa Cohn (00:27:41):
I think you touched on the key elements.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:43):
Okay. And again, the way you started is, I have some bad news for you or I have some disappointing news for you.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:48):
Yes, because it's just [inaudible 00:27:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):
Just get right into it. Yeah.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:51):
Yeah, just get right into it. Yeah. By the way, the other piece on that might be, if it's appropriate, I'd love you to digest this information and then let's talk about it again next week to see what you've come up with or see how you feel about it because you want to send, this is not the script, this is for me to you. You want to send the, I care about you message because that's the other thing. In the workplace, people, they're going through all their feelings, all their emotions, disappointments. They're going to go home and tell their spouse, didn't get the promotion or whatever. It's going to loom large. It's going to be demoralizing.

(00:28:24):
When you, as a leader signal a lot, I care about you, I care about your feelings, I care that you're disappointed, I care about your career, you are always going to be able to help people stay resilient in the face of setbacks and ultimately, do extra work, do the right work for you and be engaged in your company because you've spent the time and energy making sure they know that even when things are not going their way, they have an ally in you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):
What do you do if they just disagree, if they're just like, "But I do have those skills and I don't think this is fair." Thoughts on responding to that sort of feedback? I guess, that's the defensiveness stuff.

Alisa Cohn (00:29:06):
Yeah, that's the defensiveness stuff. And again, I hope you've done your homework to identify that actually that person doesn't have those skills and if there is a [inaudible 00:29:16] for example, but I do have those skills or sometimes people, I think more, even more often, they don't respond to what you just said. They will instead explain to you that they've been here for a year or they're the only internal candidate or their peer got promoted.

(00:29:31):
Right, they'll sort of explain to you things which are not part of your decision-making process and then it's helpful for you to say something like, "Yeah, listen, Matilda, I really understand that you were thinking that after a year, you'd get promoted around here. And in the past, I do think because of the stage of our company, probably people have been promoted at that period. That's not the place we're at right now. As we scale, we really need to think about not just what we need for today and tomorrow, but for the future. And that's why I want these specialized skills in here. I think it's going to help the entire company."

(00:30:02):
So that's an example of a discussion that you could have. I do have the skills. That's kind of interesting. I'd love to hear what you see as those skills. And it's not a problem to have the conversation right there then, but if there's a "Yes, I do, no, I don't, yes, I do, no, you don't," that pushback is never productive. And so, that's where you want to probably again take a pause and say, "Listen, I totally hear you. You and I have a different point of view about this. I'm not sure if it's productive to continue to discussing right now. Let's talk about it again in a week. But I also want you to know this is a decision that I've made."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):
I love though, when they come back to you and like, "But here's X, Y, Z." And you're like, "That's not what I was saying necessarily." I love that you basically mirror back. I hear what, I understand you believe, I understand you've been here for a year. I understand you're the only internal candidate," like making them feel very heard. That's a really powerful mechanic there. That is a good tool. Is there another script that you think might be helpful to talk through that is a common hard conversation people have?

Alisa Cohn (00:31:05):
Well, the hardest conversation is firing someone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:09):
Let's do it. Let's get into it.

Alisa Cohn (00:31:13):
[inaudible 00:31:13]. I'm willing to get into it. I just want to say two things about that. First of all, when you're firing someone, the hope is that it's not a surprise to them. You've had multiple conversations with them that they're not living up to your expectations. It's essential because the truth is, you want to create a culture where people are not surprised by being fired. And that's not even true for this one person you're dealing with. That's true for the entire company. So just kind of getting in the mindset of recognizing that if you shied away from those conversations, kind of like, "You're the problem here and you have some catch up to do."

(00:31:43):
The second thing is that before you fire someone, I think it's helpful to have the conversation before the firing conversation because something you said Lenny is like, "Oh, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm not sure." And that bleeds into, "Maybe I haven't been clear with this person." Regularly with my clients, I'll say, "Okay, have you been crystal clear about what you need from this person?" And what they always do is the hand motion like well, sort of, but well, maybe. Which means no, which means no. You've not been crystal clear or you don't perceive even crystal clear. The way to make sure that you're crystal clear is by having the conversation before it comes to that.

(00:32:23):
What that looks like is, "Listen, Matilda, we have to have a difficult conversation right now. I've talked to you multiple times about coordinating with your peers and not having them surprised about missed deadlines, and I've talked to you multiple times about keeping your team in the loop on different things. After six months of these conversations, I want you to know that the peers continue to feel like that you're operating on your own without coordinating with them. And I continue to hear from your team that they're not fully on the same page. I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, we're going to have to find a way to part ways because I can't keep this going with you. I know you have it in you to change. I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
That is very crystal clear.

Alisa Cohn (00:33:20):
Yes, crystal clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):
Yeah. Okay.

Alisa Cohn (00:33:22):
What do you think of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:24):
Yeah, that was great. So it starts with being upfront. This is a difficult conversation, just to set expectations. They're like, "Oh, shit." And then it seems like you come back to, again, multiple times this happened, observing here's what's happening. It's happened multiple times. I keep hearing from multiple people, [inaudible 00:33:44] be a problem. And so it's just like, "I need you to know," and you're just very clear. "Here's what will happen if this doesn't change."

Alisa Cohn (00:33:52):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:52):
Yeah. And I love that you also give them a little, there's always that hope for who they are and how you see them as. They're not worthless. It's just like, "You are great at a lot of things. You have these skills. You're great at blah, blah, blah, but still this is a big problem." And it's communicating how critical this is. [inaudible 00:34:08].

# Behind the scenes of Calendly’s rapid growth | Annie Pearl (CPO)

## Transcript

Annie Pearl (00:00:00):
Strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like what's your winning aspiration? But maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?

Lenny (00:00:27):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Annie Pearl. Annie is currently chief product officer at Calendly. Before that, she was chief product officer at Glassdoor. And before, that she was director of product management at Fox. She's also a member of Skip, a community for chief product officers, and she's on the board of two different companies. 

(00:00:54):
In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including how Calendly builds product, how Calendly has grown, including the wild story of how they got their first 1,000 users, and also how they built a sales team on top of what historically has been a very product-led growth company. Annie also shares a ton of great advice on how to get into product management. I learned a ton from Annie and I know you'll too. Annie also shares a few killer tips for using Calendly, which I loved. And so, with all that, I bring you Annie Pearl through a short word from our wonderful sponsors. 

(00:01:25):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. 

(00:01:56):
For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, drive ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's readymade templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. 

(00:02:32):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the dock that brings it all together and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Koda.

(00:03:10):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Koda. Koda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Koda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups.

(00:03:50):
Annie, welcome to the podcast.

Annie Pearl (00:03:53):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:55):
I've been a big fan of yours from afar. We've crossed paths a little bit on Reforge, on Twitter, probably been at events that maybe we didn't know each other at yet. So, I'm really excited to finally be chatting, real life, in real time, at least.

Annie Pearl (00:04:09):
Me as well.

Lenny (00:04:09):
I've got a Calendly question to kick things off. It feels like with Calendly one of the most awkward elements of it is I have to put the burden on someone else to book at Calendly. So, I'm sending a link and I haven't figured out a good way to send it to someone without it coming across like a power move. So, my question to you is how do I send a Calendly to someone without it feeling bad?

Annie Pearl (00:04:31):
All right, well I love this question to kick us off. We actually have a whole blog post about this if you're curious to learn more.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Oh, okay.

Annie Pearl (00:04:37):
But I think that at a high level, I think I recommend first really just kind of opening the door for the person you're trying to schedule time with to share their availability first. So instead of just sending the link, I usually start the email with something like looking forward to connecting, feel free to share, sometimes you're available or if easier, you can choose to find time on my calendar using the Calendly link here. So, opening the door to let them choose before you offer up your Calendly link, I think is a little bit of a subtle way to let them take the lead if they want. 

(00:05:08):
And the second piece I would recommend too is once you opened that door, you can further reduce the effort on the recipient by adding times you're available directly in the email. So, when you go to share a Calendly link, there's an option to add times to email and you can then just paste those directly into the email you're creating, so that reduces yet another sort of point of friction to ask the user to click the link and get taken to Calendly. So, opening the door and then adding times to email are two things that I do to really make sure that it's not awkward and it doesn't put the burden on the other person.

Lenny (00:05:39):
That is awesome advice. That first one is what I ended up doing actually. That's really interesting where you don't send the link immediately. You first just ask, "Hey, send me your Calendly." And actually, I always say, "Send me your Calendly." I assume that's what they're using. That's kind of funny.

Annie Pearl (00:05:53):
Right.

Lenny (00:05:53):
I don't even know what else is out there.

Annie Pearl (00:05:54):
That's good. That's what we like to hear.

Lenny (00:05:56):
Yeah, absolutely. It's like its own word now. Okay, that was awesome. So, there's this already actionable advice for anyone listening. 

Annie Pearl (00:06:03):
Sweet. 

Lenny (00:06:04):
Transitioning a little bit to product, the main focus of chat, you transitioned into product from being a lawyer. You told me at one point that a lot of people ask you for advice about how to transition into product from other functions, especially non-technical functions as someone without a technical background. So, what advice do you give people when they ask you how to transition into a product role?

Annie Pearl (00:06:25):
I got what I'll call lucky, which is I kind of stumbled into product management after law school, joined the founding team of a startup and ended up doing product management there. But when I think about folks who are looking to get in their product management, I think there's really two paths. I think one is more formal in nature. There are associate product manager programs out there and many scaled companies, Google, Meta. All have APM programs that you can formally apply to. And actually, when we were at Box, much earlier stage company than either of those companies I just mentioned, we actually created an APM program to help grow our bench of more junior PM. So, I think you can actually find APM programs even at smaller, earlier stage companies than even kind of big tech. So that's one, it's just formal APM programs.

(00:07:07):
I think another "more formal" way to get into PM is really by just directly applying to a junior PM role where there's no expectation of any sort of experience. I've usually seen this work best when you're already working somewhere in some product adjacency. Maybe you're in customer support, implementation, or maybe you're a sales engineer. But you can look at the internal job board and find junior PM roles that are posted and that's one way to make the move. So that's kind of on the formal side like APM programs and just applying via internal job boards.

(00:07:38):
I think on the informal side, really two suggestions here. The first one is to seek out opportunities to shadow or partner closely with a product manager and maybe even offer to take on some work. So, some of the best PMs that I've brought over to product from other functions, they really start by expressing interest in product and then start partnering closely with the product manager and maybe even doing a little bit of product work before they make that transition.

(00:08:02):
And one tactical suggestion is there's oftentimes companies will have subject matter expert programs where they want to pair someone from a go-to-market function with a certain product squad or a certain product area. And so that's becoming a SME. It allows you to really get more involved and embedded into the product team. So, that's one suggestion. And then maybe last one is just the path I did, which is joining an early stage startup. There's really usually an expectation that everyone's going to get their hands dirty doing a lot of different things. And so, I think that's one way where you might have an opportunity to try product management if you end up joining an early stage company.

Lenny (00:08:38):
So, maybe it was four, maybe it was more paths that you described. Join APM program. What was the second one again?

Annie Pearl (00:08:45):
Internal job board apply, when you're in the company.

Lenny (00:08:48):
As just like a junior PM. Two is, find someone that mentors you and helps you start doing the role. And is that internal? Is that the internal transfer app?

Annie Pearl (00:08:58):
Yeah, exactly. 

Lenny (00:08:58):
Cool. 

Annie Pearl (00:08:59):
And then, another flavor of that is sometimes companies will have these SME programs.

Lenny (00:09:03):
What is a SME program?

Annie Pearl (00:09:05):
Subject matter expert. So, you'll say, "Hey, I want to make sure we have subject matter expert in our CS team on this area of the product." And they'll partner really closely with the product manager and designer within that area.

Lenny (00:09:16):
Got it. And then the fourth bucket is, join a startup, start doing PM work and then you end up being a PM. 

Annie Pearl (00:09:21):
You got it. 

Lenny (00:09:21):
Which of those four do you find most common? And would you push people in one direction or another?

Annie Pearl (00:09:26):
Yeah, I've brought a lot of folks over internally for the path of someone's really interested in product, they express they're interested, they want to help, they want to learn, they're eager, they're curious. And so, they make that really well known and they're even willing to do some work on the side to help out and really show and demonstrate the skills before they have the job. So, I've seen that one to actually probably bring the most folks over in my role in terms of being on the product leadership side.

Lenny (00:09:53):
On the APM program route, are there any APM programs you recommend? Because I'm sure people hear this and they're like, "Yeah, but I don't know where to apply. I don't know which ones are good." I don't know if you have a list, but just what comes to mind as APM programs to go pursue? 

Annie Pearl (00:10:05):
The folks who started it all was Google, with the Google APM program. And Meta obviously has a pretty strong robust APM program. But as I mentioned around Box, I think those are obviously very, very competitive and most people want to get into them. It may be better to try and find a company like Box or a company that's a bit earlier stage, not as scaled to think about looking at those APM programs. And I'm sure if you want to, go to glassdoor.com where I used to work at Glassdoor, so had to throw that in there. You could search for associate product manager and I think you'll find a whole host of open roles that you might be able to apply to. 

Lenny (00:10:39):
That is a cool tip. I haven't heard of that. Go to Glassdoor and search for APM. So, you search for companies that have an APM title.

Annie Pearl (00:10:45):
Yes. You could just use associate product manager and you'll see all the open jobs out there and then go apply to them.

Lenny (00:10:50):
That's cool. Okay, good tip. What I find, and you mentioned this the best, if you have the option is internal transfer. If you're just like another function, you find someone that can help you move into the role.

Annie Pearl (00:11:01):
You have the relationships, you can show your work really well. The other thing I would say is when I think about folks who have successfully transferred over, I think they tend to have a couple of characteristics. They're usually very curious, they tend to be really passionate about the product and solving customer problems. And sometimes, they've even tinkered with a side project as a way to hone their PM skills. So, I think as you're thinking about making that transition, those types of characteristics really showing eagerness and interest in the product itself and solving customer problems are also great ways to get noticed and increase your chances.

Lenny (00:11:36):
Why do you think it is that not more companies have an APM program? It feels like such a win for so many people. Why is it just so rare? 

Annie Pearl (00:11:42):
Yeah, I think when we built this at Box, so drawing on that experience, it was a lot of work. If you're going to do it, you want to do it really well and you want to create an environment where you can help the associate product managers be successful, the goal is to ultimately graduate everyone from the APM program into being a product manager. And so, I think it takes a lot of intentionality and for us, it took a lot of work. We had to make sure we had clarity around the interview process. We had to make sure we had clarity around expectations in the role. We wanted to have a training element. 

(00:12:16):
We wanted to make sure that, again, we're setting people up for success. So, I think companies have to be at a stage of scale where they can really invest and they have the excess capacity to build the program in a way. I think that's going to help make sure everyone who comes through it has a chance at really learning, growing and ultimately being successful.

Lenny (00:12:33):
That's the same thing we found at Airbnb. There's a PM that was so excited to make the APM program and it just never really happens. It just takes so much work. And to your point, you have to set up for success. You want to make sure there's clear paths and you upgrade to a regular PM and have the interview.

Annie Pearl (00:12:49):
And are we doing, is this really an APM program for internal folks? Is this external? Are we going to be really trying to promote this? So, I think there's a lot of ancillary activities around the actual program itself that have to be taken into consideration to make sure that it is actually very successful.

Lenny (00:13:06):
Yeah. Maybe a last point we should probably imagine you agree with is generally just hard to get into product management. That's like the default. There's just not that many roles at companies versus say, engineers or some other functions. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:13:17):
So, I think that's just like there are not that many roles. It's a difficult role to break into, but these are the ways you can do it if you actually want to. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:17):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny (00:13:27):
Okay. So, I want to transition a little bit to talking about Calendly. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:29):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:13:29):
There are two areas I want to go. One is just how do you build product at Calendly? What have you learned about product development and team building? And then two, talk about how Calendly grows and what you've learned about growing a product like Calendly. It's such an interesting product, especially from a growth perspective. So, to start on just how product is built at Calendly, just a little context. How many product managers are there and how many PMs are there? How many people total, roughly? Yeah, just to give us a little bit of [inaudible 00:13:57].

Annie Pearl (00:13:56):
Let's see, when I joined about two years ago, I think the company was about 150 people and I think we're about 600 now. And then the product team, there were about 15 product managers and designers when I joined again about two years ago, and I think we're around 60 this year.

Lenny (00:14:08):
Wow. So, 60 product managers.

Annie Pearl (00:14:14):
Product managers, designers, and a research team. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:16):
Got it. What about just PMs?

Annie Pearl (00:14:20):
PMs probably, my guess is 20. 

Lenny (00:14:23):
Cool.

Annie Pearl (00:14:24):
Twenty-ish. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:25):
Cool. And then, can you talk about how the product team is structured roughly? If you think about a tree, [inaudible 00:14:30] tree.

Annie Pearl (00:14:30):
Yeah. So, as I mentioned, we've got product managers, we have designers, we have a research team, and then product operations. And then, on my product leadership team, we have head of design, head of research, head of product operations. And then, within the product management team, I have leaders across core, across enterprise and platform.

Lenny (00:14:50):
Got it. So, you manage the design team and engineering team, you said?

Annie Pearl (00:14:54):
Not engineering. Design, product and research. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:56):
Got it. Something that I find is one of the big differences between product orgs is design reporting up to a product leader versus not. What's the rationale there? And then has Calendly tried a different approach?

Annie Pearl (00:15:08):
Yeah. So, when I was at Glassdoor in the CPO role, I had the opportunity to lead design for the first time. So, coming into Calendly, I had led both product and design as well as research. And so, I think it made sense given I'd already done it once to keep that structure coming into Calendly. I think at the end of the day, the real benefit of the structure is really to say at the end, we want to be thinking about everything we're doing through the lens of the end-to-end user experience. And so, if we have product managers who are really prioritizing the problems we're going to go after, and we've got designers who are really trying to think about how do we bring solutions to life to solve those problems, having both of those functions roll into one person just really allows us to think more holistically around the end-to-end user experience.

(00:15:53):
So, certainly, it can work where you have product and design reporting into different leaders that ultimately report into the CEO, but when you get to this level of scale from just a pure people management, but also just the scale of the business, you know often see this consolidation where product and design start to roll into one leader. And at least in my experience, I think it can help ensure that all the different pieces of work are integrated well together and ultimately deliver a better experience for customers.

Lenny (00:16:23):
So, it sounds like before you joined it wasn't like that. And if that's true, was there something that improved with that shift?

Annie Pearl (00:16:29):
So, the structure was there that way. At that time, we didn't have a head of design, so we had a lot of really great individual contributors and who had been, many of whom had been with the company for quite some time and really contributed to the great user experience that existed in the product. But we didn't have a design leader. So, one of the first leadership hires I made was to bring in a head of design to really build out that function. And then, that head of design is a peer partnering with the different heads of products across the product management organization as well.

Lenny (00:16:59):
What about in terms of the structure, whatever you can share one level below, how do you structure teams? Is it around outcomes? Is it around features of the product? Is it around type of persona? How do you think about that? 

Annie Pearl (00:17:13):
Yeah, yeah. So, we have a core team who's really responsible for the core end to-end user experience. In many ways, they're both doing feature development and then they're also doing growth work. So, they're thinking about how do we build new features and functionalities to help our core personas, which is typically folks who are in sales, recruiting and customer success. So, anyone in an externally facing role, we're really trying to help them do their jobs better. So, the core team's thinking about features and functionalities to really help our core end user persona. And then growth work to think about the PLG funnel, everything from acquisition, activation, conversion, and retention. So, that's one group. 

(00:17:49):
And then, second group is our "enterprise group." And they're really thinking about two different personas. One is the IT admin, the person who needs to make sure that Calendly is secure and that they have all the reporting mechanisms to be able to manage their account and all the tools to manage users and groups at scale. And the second piece of that is also departmental leaders. So as Calendly selling into or being used by a sales organization, the head of sales is not the IT admin, but they are a Teams admin who needs to manage their organization within Calendly. So, the enterprise group really thinks both about the admin, but also sort of the departments and how do we better serve departments. 

(00:18:31):
And then lastly, we have a platform team who's really thinking about how do we embed Calendly into the business processes of the organizations that we support and that we provide our product into. And so, that's everything from partnerships and integrations to our APIs.

Lenny (00:18:46):
Interesting. So, it's like problem focused/persona focused. Who are you trying to sell it to?

Annie Pearl (00:18:54):
That's right, that's right. Yeah, trying to sell it to, and then the persona of who's going to be using the functionality. And then, really having those teams hone and own those personas as they're developing functionality within the product.

Lenny (00:19:07):
What's your take on OKRs? Do you all use OKRs in some form?

Annie Pearl (00:19:11):
Yes, we do. We use OKRs both at the company level. So, we have three main OKRs that we're focused on for this year, for example, across the whole company. And then we have department level OKRs, many of which are in support of the company level OKRs, but then there's some additional things that we'll be doing at the department level, for example, that aren't going to show up at the company level. So yeah, we use them both at the company as well as on the product side.

Lenny (00:19:34):
Is there anything you've learned about making OKRs work? People love them. People hate them. 

Annie Pearl (00:19:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:19:39):
Is there something you do to make OKRs work? Something you've changed, something you've learned over time in how to work with OKRs?

Annie Pearl (00:19:44):
Yeah. When I first joined, I'd say we didn't have this muscle well built out. We didn't really have a clear product strategy at the time or clear OKRs guiding the work. And so, there was a lot of great work happening, but it really was unclear how it all fit together or how we were going to measure success in that work. So that was a first phase. I think the second phase for us was we developed a product strategy. We then had product team OKRs that corresponded to that product strategy, but they were really contained to the product team and each department across the organization had their own kind of siloed OKRs. 

(00:20:20):
And then, phase three, where really, I'd say we headed into this year, we have a really clear set, as I mentioned, of company OKRs and then in these really tightly integrated plans across the company around how we're going to support the key results and ultimately deliver on the objectives. And this has been a really incredible transformation of dependency mapping, being able to make sure that we're pulling all the levers across the organization to drive our most important objective.

(00:20:47):
So, I think it's just the kind of maturing of the business from almost no OKRs to product team OKRs to now company OKRs in a really tight planning process to make sure there's a lot of integration across the company to support what we need to do as a business.

Lenny (00:21:01):
So, what I'm hearing is one of the biggest changes in learnings was to connect OKRs across from the top to the bottom, right?

Annie Pearl (00:21:08):
Absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:21:09):
Is there anything else that has made a big impact on your ability to build and ship and execute as a company in terms of changes you've made in terms of how the company and how the teams build?

Annie Pearl (00:21:20):
I think one of the biggest changes that we've made, when I first joined, again, we had a product that served a lot of horizontal users. We help solo users who are freelancers, consultants. We help sales teams, we help recruiting teams, we help customer success, we help folks in education. So, we had a very broad user base. And what that means is that product managers in particular are I think had a really hard time prioritizing. At any point in time, it was really difficult to say, should I do work on feature A or for feature B without that clarity? And so, I think one of the most impactful things we did pretty early on in my tenure here was to hone in on our overall product strategy, but a poor piece of that being what's the actual market we're going after? What are the segments of that market? Who are the personas within the segments of that market?

(00:22:09):
And so, we've made a pretty clear distinction now that while a lot of the feature work that we'll do to support our target personas of sales teams, customer success teams and recruiting teams will impact folks who are not in those personas. Those are the core ICPs that we're going after. And so, historically, that would've been always a sort of trade off decision and a question. And now I think we have a lot of rigor around who our target market and then persona we're going after. And so, teams can use that to prioritize and also just deliver better value for those users.

Lenny (00:22:45):
So, it sounds like the biggest unlock and one of the biggest unlocks for making the team more efficient, move faster, make decisions quicker, is narrowing in on exactly who you're going to be selling to.

Annie Pearl (00:22:55):
I think it's one of the harder things for companies to do. So, it sounds relatively easy, and I think most companies believe that they have clarity around this. But then when you go down into the weeds of asking someone who's product manager or a designer, I don't know that it's always as clear because there's always a bit of a hesitation to say no, right? And the idea of saying no is scary. When in reality, the ability to say no is going to allow you to make sure you're building something that's going to be amazing for the people that matter most and not something that's going to be average or okay for a lot of different people.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Was there anything that was really hard about actually executing that, convincing people we're going to narrow and not worry about these people and any lessons from going through that process? Because I imagine a lot of founders listening are like, "Oh, that sounds we should be doing this, but oh man, we're leaving all this money on the table, people are going to be pissed."

Annie Pearl (00:23:45):
Yeah, I think it's a pretty big cultural shift. So, some of this intersects with the shift from product led growth to adding in a sales motion. So, when I joined Calendly, all of our ARR came from our PLG channel. We didn't have a sales team, we just hired a CRO who was going to build out a sales team. And so, in that world, the way you think about product, the way you think about processes, even the people you have on the team are tailored to that business model. And then, as we sort of moved up market and have now explicitly started to go after teams of users and departments of users and organizations of larger scale, everything about people, process, and product all changes. 

(00:24:29):
I think I touched on culture because I think that's pervasive across the entire organization. The way that things get done has to be highly integrated versus can be a bit more siloed when you're just sort of the self-service PLG business that in many ways runs itself through the product being well optimized. So, there's a lot of process change that needs to happen, the type of people that you need to bring into the organization, that changes as you layer in the new selling motion. And then the product itself of course has to change. 

(00:24:56):
So, I guess let's just say the example of PLG and SLG or the direct selling motion is tied in to your question around what are the things that need to change in order to get clear on your target user? And I think it's highly cultural in nature across people, across process, and then obviously across the actual product itself.

Lenny (00:25:15):
I have a whole bunch of questions about how Calendly grows and maybe we just get into some of the stuff because I imagine a lot of people are interested. First, let me ask this. I imagine Calendly mostly grows through, I sign up for Calendly, they send it to everyone when I book a meeting and they're like, "Oh, what is this?" And they're like, "Oh, cool, I'm going to use this." And then they start using, it spreads, and then sales eventually finds people at a company that are using it a lot and tries to get the whole company in it. Is that roughly right?

# Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)

## Transcript

Anton Osika (00:00:00):
... Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product. The reason is to enable those who have had such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
You guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe. How did you decide on Lovable is the name. It's so sweet.

Anton Osika (00:00:31):
The best word for a great product is that it's lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product and then building an absolutely lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
People would wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important?

Anton Osika (00:00:51):
Doing a bit of everything. Being a generalist, I think much more important than it used to be. If I'm putting together a product team today, I would really obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?

Anton Osika (00:01:07):
People love the product. That's the driver of the growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today, my guest is Anton O-C-K. Anton is co-founder and CEO of Lovable, which is essentially an AI engineer that takes an English prompt and codes a product for you in minutes. You can then talk to it, iterate on the product, and then launch it to the world. It's one of the fastest growing products in history. The fastest growing startup in Europe ever, and as Anton describes, their goal for Lovable is for it to be the last piece of software that anybody has to write because it'll be able to create all future products for us. They launched just a few months ago in the first four weeks, hit 4 million ARR in the first two months across 10 million ARR, all with just 15 people. Absurd. In our conversation, we covered a lot of ground, including a live demo of Lovable, how their team operates, how they hire, what has most enabled their team to scale this quickly with so few people, pro tips for using Lovable, how it all started, how he recommends you build product teams going forward with tools like this existing, what skills will matter more and less going forward?

(00:02:17):
Plus how to think about Lovable versus competitors and so much more. If you're trying to wrap your head around how product building will change with the rise of AI tools, this episode is a must watch.

Anton, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Anton Osika (00:05:19):
It's a pleasure to talk to you, Lenny, great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:22):
I don't know how you have time to do this podcast. Your life must be insane these days with the pace at which you guys are scaling, just how much is changing in AI every day. So I just extra appreciate you making time for this. I think you said it's 10:30, your time, is when we're doing this.

Anton Osika (00:05:39):
I'm a bit tired, yes. Mostly from the crazy pace of everything, but yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:45):
This is going to be an invigorating conversation and you're not going to be able to sleep.

Anton Osika (00:05:50):
Yes. I'm sure. I'm sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
Okay, so for folks that are maybe a little bit familiar with Lovable or not at all familiar, what is Lovable? What's the simplest way to understand it?

Anton Osika (00:06:00):
I'd say Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product from the AI. And what this means is that entrepreneurs actually today, they turn their ideas into real businesses. We have a lot of designers and product managers that create the first version of their product ideas to show to the teams, and some of them become founders because of the empowerment from this, but also developers themselves, they actually writing code or creating products much faster. The reason, it's pretty obvious for me, but I'll spell it out, the reason why we're doing Lovable is that I don't know about your mom, but my mom doesn't write code and-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
Same.

Anton Osika (00:06:55):
... almost all my friends throughout my life reached out for help. Like, "Anton, I need to build something. How do I find a great software engineer?" And we are building for this 99% of the population who don't write code. Currently, if you're technically inclined, you get much further, but over time, naturally the way to build software is by just talking to an AI. And that's how we see it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):
I love the way that you guys describe it and you didn't mention it, but I think it's building the last piece of software ever. How do you phrase that?

Anton Osika (00:07:28):
Yeah, we say we're building the last piece of software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):
The last piece of software. Okay, we're going to do a live demo, but first of all, can you just share some stats on the scale of this business at this point because it's quite absurd.

Anton Osika (00:07:42):
Yeah. So we launched Lovable less than three months ago, and now we have 300,000 monthly active users and 30,000 of those are actually paying and it is growing at the same rates, just almost only through organic word of mouth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:02):
Okay. And I'll share a couple stats in terms of revenue, just so folks know this, and we'll have this in the intro too. I think you guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe, and you guys had to rewrite your entire code base recently and you couldn't ship any new features for a while. Is that right?

Anton Osika (00:08:26):
That's right, yeah. People were saying like, "Oh, you're shipping so fast." And we were all quite frustrated because we wrote our service in this kind of scripting language and then as we started scaling, we were just, no, we have to throw everything away and rewrite it in a more performant way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:43):
Okay, before we get to the demo, last question, you shared there's some companies that have started based on Lovable. I didn't even know that. So what are some examples of companies slash businesses that have launched off of Lovable and now are actually companies?

Anton Osika (00:08:56):
I mentioned designers using Lovable and one of our early users, Harry, he started shipping real web apps to his clients instead of just shipping designs. And then he went on to say, okay, wait, I'm going to start an AI startup. And his company, he launched on Product Hunt and everything and making money is just like, let's anyone upload their photo library and then the AI parses and categorizes it. And if you go to launched.lovable.app, this is an app built with Lovable is again a product Hunt version where you can see a lot of businesses or small SaaS featured there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
Okay, cool. So we're going to come back to some of this stuff, but let's get into demo. I rarely do demos on this podcast, but I'm finding that I think it's really important for people to see these products in action because in a large part, this is the future of product building and a lot of people hear about, "Oh yeah, AI's coming," and I don't think a lot of people actually see what the latest tools are capable of. And so I love showing these sorts of things on this podcast.

Anton Osika (00:10:05):
So Lenny, I was thinking, did you ever consider making a copy and build your own Airbnb?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:14):
I haven't, but go on.

Anton Osika (00:10:17):
How about you do that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Let's do it. Let's do it. Okay, so we're going to make our own Airbnb.

Anton Osika (00:10:18):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
Okay, cool.

Anton Osika (00:10:22):
So I just put in the first prompt for an Airbnb clone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):
Okay. And what is the prompt, just for folks that aren't watching?

Anton Osika (00:10:31):
Two words, Airbnb clones. That's the prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):
Okay.

Anton Osika (00:10:34):
Just start simple and then what you get is that the AI says, okay, I can go through what does a beautiful Airbnb clone look like and it goes through a bit of design decisions and then I'll zoom out to see more of it. We have this just UI that is... I mean it has all the nice things you would expect from Airbnb clone where you see different categories and you can see two listings from Airbnb with login buttons and everything. So far it doesn't have the functionality of Airbnb, it just has the UI. I would now ask for an improvement on some of the functionality. Like if I'm switching category, I want to see different listings, let's say. But if you have any thoughts on what we should build next, let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:25):
Okay, and so you had this preloaded, so you didn't see how long it would take, but how long would this normally take for it to just write all this code and have it for you?

Anton Osika (00:11:32):
The first prompt takes 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
30 seconds? Okay. And it's like a very good copy of Airbnb. I love that you didn't have to show it a design, you just tell it Airbnb and it knows. Okay, so your question is would I want to add to my own version of Airbnb? I've always wanted to explore buying the place that I look at just like, Is this for sale? So what if we see what that would feel like if you're just a way to buy a listing.

Anton Osika (00:11:59):
Okay. Okay. So how about we add, I mean prompting is important here, so let's be specific, but we would ask, add a button on the listing which has purchased this Airbnb home. Is that it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
Perfect.

Anton Osika (00:12:19):
Okay, so, add, and [inaudible 00:12:19]. I'll be even more specific. It will pop up a model to purchase the listing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:32):
Perfect. And I love... So I think something as you're typing, I'm just going to share thoughts as you're doing this. So the site that you asked this AI engineer to build, it's actually a functioning website that you can browse around. It's not just a design, obviously there's no actual listings here, there's no actual houses here. Say you were trying to actually build Airbnb and you wanted to start adding actual homes that plug into this, how does that sort of step work?

Anton Osika (00:13:02):
So as you say, this is just kind of the mockup UI, but it's also interactive. If I want to add login and add listing management, then we will connect something called the backend. So where data is stored, where user's log information is stored, and I can show you how to do that. First let's just try out where we got with this short prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
Let's do it.

Anton Osika (00:13:31):
Adding the purchase listing and it didn't do exactly what I wanted. I said, add a button... Or I didn't say what a button should say, but it says book now, and if I click book now I get a booking confirmation. So the AI was like, okay, it didn't... It was probably surprised by you wanting to buy the listing since it's Airbnb. So it still says book the listing, but it shows a pretty model where I can click confirm and pay. And then it's says booking confirmed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:05):
I'll just say real quick, I love that this is actually a really good example of why being a good product manager is important. A lot of wasted time happens when you're not clear about the problem you're trying to solve and why you're trying to solve it and all that kind of stuff. So it's really cool that this is a use case where you have to be really good at explaining what it is you want. And it's interesting, you don't have to tell this AI-why. Humans want to understand, "Why is this important." Mostly you need to be very clear about what it is you're doing and I love that's a really strong PM skill. Your PM's really good at that. So we have to...

Anton Osika (00:14:39):
Hey. Explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans. So I'm going into hooking up more of the actual functionality, but first I'll actually show you something. What's the fastest way to change what went wrong, it's created buttons that say book now and I want them to say, "Buy now." And what I could do is select this item and say change it to buy now. But what we just realized is that you can actually edit this, this is a fully functioning product, but you can edit it visually like you do in Squarespace and Wix and so on. So I'll just change the text to buy now and then it instantly changes. It actually changes deep down in the code base, but it's very fast to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
So I think people listening to this and seeing this, if you're not aware this is the cutting edge of tools like this, no other tool out there lets you generate code from an AI engineer and then actually just change a small element of it of every other tool that I'm aware of. You have to ask the agent, do this for me, and then you hope that it does the right thing. So this is a huge deal which you just showed. Right?

Anton Osika (00:16:00):
Yeah. Now it says buy now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:01):
Okay. Like that's amazing. Okay, and that's something you just launched?

Anton Osika (00:16:04):
Yeah. Great. We just launched this a few days ago, but I won't go into for building the full functionality, but what it looks like is that you connect an open source backend as a service and that's called SuperBase. And I have this instance to connect to that's completely empty, just like one click to set that up and now it's connected to the backend. It's just automatically generating some code and explaining what I can do next. And what I would do now is, say, let's add login, let's say let's add login.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
And where is it actually hosted on the backend and everything in general?

Anton Osika (00:16:45):
So everything can be one click deployed and then it's running. It's hosted by a cloud vendor, which is hosting, I think a huge chunk of the internet, it's called Cloudflare, and the backend is hosted by also good cloud writer, which is called SuperBase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):
Amazing. Okay, let's wrap up the demo, that was... Unless there's anything else, was there anything else really important that you wanted to show?

Anton Osika (00:17:14):
No I'll just explain what I would do next. I would say, okay, let's add login. Let's make the listings editable by the users so users can upload listings and then this is going to take a bit more time, but with patience and good prompting skills, you're going to get to a full working Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:33):
That was a really good piece to add. So basically this is getting to a place where it actually is not so different from actual Airbnb. People can log in, they can add their home, you can add internal tools to add listings for your, say, sales team, ops team. Basically it just will allow you to build a marketplace that looks a lot like Airbnb. Amazing. Okay, thank you for the demo. I think for a lot of people they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I've seen this kind of stuff," for most people, like, "Holy shit." It's unreal what... It's almost like we're taking for granted now. You can ask an app to build you a whole website and that costs probably like a few pennies. It took like five minutes versus it would've been tens of thousands and weeks and weeks and months to even build just a prototype.

Anton Osika (00:18:23):
I mean, these tools as we see here, they're already very good, it looks really good as well, but mainly I would say they're getting better very, very fast. And I'd say one of the bigger bottlenecks is now they're not integrated into the current way that you have your existing products and so on. But since they're getting better so fast, I think the best thing for people who are interested in this or interested in just being a part of the future economies, get your hands very dirty with these tools because being in the top 10% in using them is going to absolutely set you apart in the coming months and years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:05):
So let me follow that thread. So say you are magically able to sit next to everybody that is using Lovable for the first time and you could just whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with Lovable, what would that tip be?

Anton Osika (00:19:20):
It takes a lot to master using tools like Lovable and being very curious and patient and we have something called chat mode where you can just ask to understand like, "How does this work? I'm not getting what I want here, am I missing something? What should I do?" Is the best way to be productive is also one of the best ways to just learn about how software engineering works, which is you don't have to write the code anymore, but it is useful to understand how software engin- or how building products works. So I think that's the patience and curiosity is super useful. The second part that we spoke about is that being, if I would sit next to you, I would probably say like, "Hey, you are not being super clear here." For example, don't say it doesn't work. Just explain exactly what you're expecting and which parts are working and which parts are not working. And that's something that a lot of people don't do naturally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
I love that when you have an engineer you're working with that does a very expensive mistake to miscommunicate something, to just forget about a feature, to forget a better requirement, and here it's... You do that and then 30 seconds later you're like, "Oh okay, sorry, that was wrong." And then you could just try again.

Anton Osika (00:20:41):
That's true. It might be more costly with humans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
Okay, and so the first step is chat mode. So your advice is chat with the... What do you call it? Do you call it an agent? What's the term for the thing that you were talking with?

Anton Osika (00:20:57):
Yeah, Lovable is an agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:59):
Just Lovable?

Anton Osika (00:20:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:00):
Okay. So you're talking about Lovable by the way. How decide on Lovable as the name? It's so sweet.

Anton Osika (00:21:06):
I think it's all about building a great product. That's what I want more people to be able to do and the best word for a great product is that it's Lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum Lovable product and then building a Lovable product and then building an absolutely Lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):
That is great. Absolute Lovable product. ALP is the new MVP. Okay, so we talked about this, the scale you guys have hit at this point, I imagine it's far beyond 10 million ARR. Do you share that at this point or are you keeping that private?

Anton Osika (00:21:51):
We don't anchor on the numbers, but I could probably do a two X tweet about this quite soon. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:57):
Okay, so it's far beyond 10 million ARR at this point. It's one of the fastest growing startups in history, the fastest growing startup in Europe. I want to zoom us back to the beginning. What is the origin story of Lovable? How did it all begin? What was the journey to today?

Anton Osika (00:22:14):
I think I was not impressed by what people were doing with the large language models [inaudible 00:22:21], especially after I was using them way back. But when ChatGPT came out, they were starting to get really good at taking a human instruction and spitting out code and then people in my team, I was the CTO at a YC startup, they felt like, "Oh, Anton, you're exaggerating. This is not going to change anything in the coming years." So I wanted to prove a point and I created an open source tool called GPT Engineer where you write something like create a snake game and then it spits out a lot of code, a little of different files and then opens the snake game. And then I tweeted a video about that and GPT Engineer is to date the most popular open source tool to showcase the ability for large language models to create applications and it's at like 50 something thousand GitHub stars and dozens of academic references.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:21):
And I know that I'll just add that it GitHub shut you down because they thought it was some kind of attack, like how many stars you're getting, how many people were using it,

Anton Osika (00:23:29):
Right. Yeah. So that came later. That's with Lovable. So this is Lovable. Lovable, earlier was always creating new projects on GitHub when someone used Lovable and we asked them, "Is it fine? How was the limits here?" They said, "Oh, there are no limits." But once we started creating 15,000 projects per day, so there were a lot of usage. Then some engineer when was on call, maybe they woke up in the night and they saw their servers were taking too much load because of us. So then they shut off down completely and we got this email that said, "Oh, you broke some kind of rules and we didn't know what was going on."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:13):
That's similar to a story I heard when ChatGPT was originally being trained, Microsoft servers blocked it because they thought it was some crawler and it was just actually the very first version ChatGPT being trained on data. Anyway, keep going.

Anton Osika (00:24:29):
So I built this tool called GPT Engineer and I was thinking about we're seeing the biggest change humanity will ever see, I think, where before you had the manual labor being taken over by machines, but now it's actually cognitive labor being done better than humans by machines and what's the best way to have some kind of positive impact here? It's not to make engineers more productive, which there's a lot of companies using AI to make engineers more productive, Microsoft did with co-pilot and so on. But it is to enable those who have such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their beliefs into reality. So enabling more entrepreneurship and innovation by building the AI software engineer for anyone. And then I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a founder, Fabian, and I said we should build something like GPT Engineer but it has to be for the people who don't write code and that's the story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:43):
Okay. And then that became lovable? There's the shift from open source into a product that anyone can use but also pay for. Makes sense. Okay, so from that point I saw a stat that you started making a million dollars in ARR per week and once you launched lovable, is that true?

Anton Osika (00:26:00):
Yeah, so launched, we actually called the first version of the product like GPT Engineer app and it was very different in some ways and we launched that under a waitlist and said like, Oh yeah, we have this waitlist and we got a lot of feedback and iterated. Finally, when we thought the product was really good we said okay, now we have a Lovable product. And it was mainly on the AI that we did a lot of improvements, once we launched that, that was 21st of November, so that's almost three months ago. We just hit 1 million ARR in a week and then it kept growing at that pace. It still growing at even faster than that pace.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
Faster than 1 million ARR per week. Holy shit.

Anton Osika (00:26:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):
Okay, that sounds like product market fit to me. You said that you did a lot of work on the backend. I saw you tweet about this that you guys figured out some kind of unlock on scalability, like a new scaling law that allowed you to build something like this. What can you talk about there that on the technical element allowed you to build something new and the successful?

Anton Osika (00:27:08):
There are many scaling laws I would say when you build AI systems and this one in particular is about when you put in more work, the product reliably gets better and better. And what you've seen generally when you have AI building something is that it can get stuck in some place. It is super good in the beginning and then it gets stuck. What we did was to painstakingly identify places where it got stuck and there is different approaches but address different ways how we do it but address the places where it gets stuck, tune the entire system quantitatively and having a very fast feedback loop to improve it in the areas where it got stuck. The most important areas, it still does get stuck sometimes, but that's the scaling law and we're still early in that scaling law, I would say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:04):
And so when you talk about things getting stuck, it's like the AI agent just saying, I don't know what to do from this point or they introduce some kind of bug. Is that an example of getting stuck?

Anton Osika (00:28:13):
Yeah. It introduces some kind of bug and then it's not smart enough to figure out how to get out of that bug.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:20):
I see. And this is a common problem people have with tools like this is they get to a certain point and then it's like, "Well I don't know what to do. I'm not an engineer, here's a bug it's running into or the infrastructure's built the wrong way." And so it sounds like one of the paths to solving that is what you're describing is you make the AI smarter to avoid more and more of these places they get stuck. Another is people just learning how to get AI unstuck. This is something when we had Amjad on the podcast from Replit, he said that this is the main skill that he thinks people need to learn is how to unstuck AI when it runs into a problem. Just thoughts there, I don't know anything along those lines come up as I say that.

Anton Osika (00:29:04):
This is something that is a problem today and the frontier of where this is a problem is very rapidly receding back. So what we did was we identified the most important areas, so specifically adding login, creating data persistence, adding payment with Stripe. Those are the things that we made sure it doesn't get stuck on, for example. And the places where it gets stuck today is currently something that you can use being very good at understanding and getting unstuck, but in the future it won't be so important. This experience just going to not get stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:48):
And I know you're not talking super in-depth about this because this is one of your unfair advantages, this kind of stuff you figured out. So I'm not going to push too far. I know you want not everyone's into exactly the same stuff. So I want to zoom back to the pace of growth that you guys have seen. One of the big stories, everyone's always looking at you guys of like 15 people, 10 million ARR in two months. That's absurd. I don't know if it's ever been done in history. If so, it's maybe a couple other AI startups recently. How have you been able to do this? What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?

Anton Osika (00:30:24):
I'd like to take credit of having done everything end to end in the product, but we are building on top of taking the oil here, which we have discovered oil, which is are the foundation models and then what we've done is that we're obsessed about what's the right way to present this to a user. What's the interface for the human to get as much out of this as possible? Packaging together, I showed you in the demo how you can add authentication and making this work seamlessly together as a whole. That's what we've done. And then people love the product. That's the driver of the growth. For getting awareness, we've mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media, that's how people know about us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:17):
So building in public is how people usually describe that. So I think it's like you guys have the advantage of the demos are just like, "Holy shit, you can do that." And then you guys share the numbers that you guys are growing at. So it's innately interesting and shareable, but I imagine most people have something interesting to share. I guess is there anything that you think you did that other companies maybe haven't done that make the product so lovable?

Anton Osika (00:31:43):
I mean the team is everything in building a great product, so I just give a big shout-out to the team that has written the code. I haven't written much of the code recently, I would say. You want people who can ship really fast and have good taste for what this simple, what's the right abstractions and I think that's what we've done differently and have this obsession for us making it better and better and better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):
This episode is brought to you by the Fundrise Flagship Fund. Full disclosure, real estate investing is boring. Prediction markets are exciting. Meme coins are a thrill ride. Even the stock market can swing wildly on a headline. Hello Deepseek. But with real estate and investing there's no drama or adrenaline or excuses to refresh your portfolio every few minutes. Just bland and boring stuff like diversification and dividends. So you won't be surprised to learn that the Fundrise Flagship real estate fund is a complete snoozefest. The fund holds 1.1 billion dollars worth of institutional caliber real estate managed by team of pros focused on steadily growing your net worth for decades to come, see? Boring.

That's the point. You can start investing in minutes and with as little as $10 by visiting Fundrise.com slash Lenny. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship fund before investing. Find this information and more in the fund's prospectus at fundrise.com slash flagship. This is a paid ad.

(00:33:22):
Okay, I want to come back to the team. I know you have a lot of thoughts there in terms of writing code, how much do you guys actually use AI to write the code that is building Lovable? How does that work on your team?

Anton Osika (00:33:32):
We have set up lovable so that we can change lovable with itself. We have done that. There is a lot of hyper-specific things in terms of running a separate... We spin up a dedicated computer for each user. It doesn't do everything. Lovable doesn't do everything. So we use the tools that are for developers, not for the 99%, most of the time. And everyone uses AI all the time in writing code. It's also in great course for experimentations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
And are there tools like Cursor and stuff like that? Like any tools you can share right now?

## Transcript

Anuj Rathi (00:00:00):
There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working now design properly. So, as a leader, do you have the right people in terms of capability? If not, is the right answer for us to coach them or to really put them... or mentor them and so on, or move them to some other place because maybe their capability is suited elsewhere? If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you? Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not just have enough time? So on and so forth. So you need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?

Lenny (00:00:50):
Today, my guest is Anuj Rathi. I've been looking to get more India-based product leaders on the podcast because this podcast has a large audience in India. When I put out a call on Twitter and LinkedIn asking people who I should have on, Anuj was the single most requested person. Anuj is Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Jupiter Money. Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Revenue and Growth at Swiggy where he spent seven years. He was also VP of Product at Snapdeal, a Senior PM at Walmart Labs, and the very first Product Manager at Flipkart where he led the buyer experience team.

(00:01:24):
In our conversation, we dig into how product management is different in India, Anuj's lessons about building product experiences for new users, how he operationalized the working backwards process at the companies he's worked at, why he pushes his teams to explore three divergent directions before settling on a plan, why he thinks product managers and companies should be much more full stack than they are. Also, a bunch of frameworks and contrarian takes about building product and your career in product. A big thank you to Sayan Maiti and Nikhil Kulkarni for helping me navigate the product scene in India. Look for more amazing India-based product leaders to come. With that, I bring you Anuj Rathi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:08):
This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate, but most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages.

(00:04:31):
Anuj, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Anuj Rathi (00:04:34):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:04:37):
It's my pleasure. I haven't told you this, but when I put a call out on Twitter and LinkedIn for people's favorite India-based product leaders, you are the single most recommended person, and so I just wanted to start with how does it feel to be the most loved India-based product leader at least according to my Twitter followers and LinkedIn followers?

Anuj Rathi (00:04:58):
Well, it feels really good, and I really feel it's come together because I've been doing product management for the longest time. In 2010, when I started the product management journey with Flipkart. I think that that was a time when there were not a lot of products being built for India. So I think one part is just the tenure, and B, I think it's just a lot of people have known the work.

Lenny (00:05:20):
Awesome. You're very modest. I wanted to start with a question about product in India, and I'm just curious just how is product management and product building in general just most different in India?

Anuj Rathi (00:05:33):
Yeah. I think that's a very interesting question, and I think about this all the time. When I look at product management in India, and I do have a lot of friends comparing product management versus in US or even in Europe versus even in China, Southeast Asia, et cetera. I think India has had a very interesting journey of products in general and hence, product management also. I think till about 2010-ish, there were not really many products built for the Indian consumers in the first place. There were a lot of products being built, a lot of technology being built, but largely, because it was a back office, so you had a lot of great engineers working in companies which would build products for the American customer or even for the European customer and so on. So once these startups started coming in, which were thinking about building for the Indian consumers, I think we did not really have that talent which we could directly tap into. We're trained into product building. Forget product management as a field in the first place. There were no colleges which were teaching anything about this. There was no playbooks, and so on, and so forth. We would go to the internet, and look at YouTube, and look at SVPG and all of that, but what we would understand would not... you could not put directly to the Indian startups.

(00:06:48):
The way that they shaped up I think also shaped up the way product management field would evolve in India. So it's taken a bunch of iterations, and I think there are two or three different waves that have come in, and we are way closer to how good product management should be done in India. We still have a little bit way to go compared to, say, US. I also think of it along... For example, in US, the product building culture probably started in 1970s, the modern software product building culture, and you didn't only have product manager, but the entire ecosystem... If you think about a company, who is the VP of business, and who is the VP of supply, and sales, and ops, and technology, and all of that? That group knew how to work with each other to build software products. They understood how that would be built and what to expect.

(00:07:37):
I think in India, when we were in 2010, et cetera, even those different people who needed to come together to build, say, e-commerce, they would come from, say, FMCG, or they would come from manufacturing and so on. What they would have seen in their journeys in terms of what we expect is a very request response kind of understanding which is, "Here's machinery. If I give this X resources, I expect, with a little bit of variability, why predictable output will come," and that mentality also moved on to what I expect from product managers or product building journeys and so on. So I think over a period of time, a lot of those cycles have happened, and a lot more other leaders in companies have now seen those cycles and understood, "All right. Now, I understand software is not machinery. Consumers are not predictable as much as we thought." That has led to, now, finally, I think, product management coming of age.

Lenny (00:08:34):
You said that, I guess, in the Bay Area, things started 1970s, something like that. When would you say things started to really ramp up in modern product thinking in India?

Anuj Rathi (00:08:43):
I think 2010 was when it started because... Look, there were a few products that were built before that also, and I think somebody said this clearly that usually, when modern consumer internet starts coming in countries, it usually starts with travel, so you do have... Basically, any country, we would start with, usually, the first travel company. So I think India started with some companies like MakeMyTrip and so on way earlier. There were a few very interesting products being built in India which were solving uniquely for the Indian consumers that were in the matrimony side which is Shaadi.com, and Bharmatrimony.com, and so on. We're like, "What do you think about Tinder?" India is famous for arranged marriages, so a product that would really understand that, "Hey, if you're a parent, if you want to get your kid up for matrimony, how would you solve for them?" and that marketplace of matchmaking, et cetera started.

(00:09:34):
So a few blips here and there which was following uniquely for India. I think 2010 was a decade or time when I can very clearly imagine that's where a lot of people started building for India. So I think, again, Flipkart started that kind of journey, but in a couple of years, then they were like, say, Ola which was, in a way, similar to Uber, what they were doing elsewhere, and then a whole bunch of other startups that started coming in. So, for example, in food delivery, when I was working at Swiggy, that came in like, say, 2015, 2014, in that timeframe. Now, you see a whole bunch of startups which are trying to do not only things which are... what could an Uber for India look like or what could a DoorDash for India look like. Very different and also, very innovative. So I think now is the time when you see a lot more product building around that area.

Lenny (00:10:24):
Where are some numbers of just like companies in India, people in India's money spent in India? I don't know. Things that would be like, "Wow, that is a much bigger opportunity than I thought."

Anuj Rathi (00:10:33):
Okay. This is a very wide question, so I'll tell you. Before the opportunity in India, I think I'll talk about the complexity in India which I think a lot of people don't understand. India has what? 1.4 billion people. So there were three waves, really, that happened in India, but also, in the globe. I think first wave was from desktop to mobile, and then even from mobile to smartphones. From smartphones, there was what we call the Jio revolution. There's an Indian company called Reliance Jio that basically got internet at the cheapest prices for smartphones. So because of this, a whole population came onto the internet which was hungry for newer products, newer content, completely different ways of interacting with each other, and using internet for all sorts of different things. That was one of the waves.

(00:11:24):
The other part is really what the Indian government really enabled which is... especially in digitization of a bunch of absolute core fundamental citizen-related machinery which is either through digital payments, which is a whole bunch of Indians now started having a bank account by default, and something called UPI. So even if you do not have a bank account or that bank account is linked to your mobile phone number, but now everybody would pay through that, and that brought in a very different kind of revolution. So even if 5 rupees, that is basically 10 cents or less than that, that would be paid through UPI, and people started moving away from cash and so on. There's something called the India Stack that is all of these things coming together, which is social security, identity, payments, and so on, that a whole bunch of other apps can now use to build their own layers on top of that. So many interesting cases started coming about. So that's one which is just a number and the infrastructure.

(00:12:25):
Now, the other thing to look at is India is very diverse, so the number of languages spoken here, even the official languages is so high, and they say... There's an elders' quote in India like, "Every 15 miles, the language will change, and the people and the culture will change, and it's a huge country of so many people." So your traditional ways of thinking about products also, the "Who I'm building for?" is very different. "Are you building for this person or that?" Et cetera. So a bunch of frameworks break down because it's not even that the same language will apply. While English is a language that is used by the people at least who have the money and who have the dollar to even give to you, but you have to think way more widely.

(00:13:06):
The other thing about India that is interesting is the price that people are willing to pay. Generally, it does look at the per capita money that people have. It is very low. It's in the two, two and a half thousand dollar range compared to US which is maybe 30 times more and so on. So while there's a lot of people who are going to give you traffic, and engagement, and so on, but the craft of actually choosing the right kind of paying customer who will actually come, and engage, and give you money is at a premium. So a lot harder work needs to be done. If you're running e-commerce, who are the people who will pay me delivery fee? Who are the people who will actually buy this expensive stuff? So a whole bunch of different ways of thinking has evolved in this country, and that's why it's so vibrant and so different than any other global products.

Lenny (00:14:01):
Wow. Fascinating. I could keep going, but I want to talk product. I've collected a bunch of questions from people that know you or people that have worked with you about a bunch of different stuff, so I'm just going to go a little bit all over the place. The first area I wanted to talk about is the user experience. Apparently, you have a interesting insight and a different approach of thinking about new users and new user experiences.

Anuj Rathi (00:14:24):
One of the things that I realized once we started working with the products is that product managers and generally, companies are too engrossed in thinking about... because they are very close to the product. It's close to their heart, and they're looking at it all the time. They're looking at a lot of minor nuances in terms of how this works and feels, and almost inherent into this is the bias that everybody is thinking about this product all day, all the time, and so on, and so forth. Whereas the reality is most consumers in the country or in your target market, they don't care, and they may have sometime heard about your product. The word of mouth is not ever so strong, even if you're the strongest brand, and so on, and so forth, but that is the customer that you've got to bring in, and then serve.

(00:15:07):
So there's very interesting insight that I heard from Scott Belsky from Adobe, and then now, he's doing very interesting stuff, and that stayed with me which was you have to think about users on modern internet consumers having three attributes. So they are lazy, they are vain, and they're selfish. So lazy meaning, "I don't have time for this, so blow my mind away. Otherwise, I'm not going to pay attention." Vain which means, "I have a habit. I'm solving this problem in a particular way, and here, you come with your two-pack product and ask me to change my habit. Do you really expect me to do that?" That's second. That's their inherent attribute. The third one is that they're selfish like, "Show me what's in it for me."

(00:15:52):
Once you start thinking about users in that vein, and if these users are not even using your product, suddenly, you realize, "Oh my god, it's quite difficult even... How do I attract this kind of customer, and if my marketing team has done a good job at bringing this user to my product, how do I actually now empathize with this lazy, selfish, and vain customer, and build my product in a way so that I can make this appear on your site like this is the thing that you have to use, the way you write your copy, the way you build your onboarding, the way you do your first warm welcome?" It's going to make the biggest amount of change in terms of a product success, then your core product features that you're going to build for your loyal consumers.

(00:16:37):
So that one insight, and I've seen and applied that multiple times not only the companies that I worked with, the companies I've consulted and spoken with. Most neglect it. Well, they get user onboarding is important, but just how important is that is one, and B, the craft of thinking like a user who's lazy, vain, and selfish, and basically, rejecting all your products, but this does not work for this kind of customer. It's extremely hard. It's very hard, but it's totally worth it if you put that lens on.

Lenny (00:17:06):
Is there an example of you using this framework on a product you worked on where you're just like, "Here's a thing we really did..." I don't know, had a big impact or really surprised everyone?

Anuj Rathi (00:17:16):
So we used it in two different areas. So one is, of course, products I worked on. So I worked in Swiggy for the last seven years, and really, when we started working towards this user, instead of thinking about everybody as, "This is what our onboarding experience looks like, and this is what our product is." So, essentially, we used, basically, say, a key that it's... "We are a food delivery app. We are a grocery delivery app, and we have these bunch of things." Instead of that, we just started reframing it from the point of view of, "What would you want, and how could you use us? What is it in it for you?" and we started connecting all our marketing messages along with the onboarding. So even going out market and thinking, "Where do you actually find us? How did you know about us? It's a reasonably large brand. Why have you not already downloaded us and used us? Have you used us and rejected us in the past?" So building that entire mental model and looking at a user from the point of view of, "Let's assume that you have heard about us 20 times. What was that exact situation that brought you to download this app?"

(00:18:20):
So right from the entire journey of you hearing us, what was the trigger, and what was the marketing message, and what was the promotion that we were running? How do we continue that journey on your onboarding from your splash, that 200 rupees of... X rupees if you buy from us, continuing that entire journey in the language that they understand and with the user experience that is continuation from the marketing to product, other thing that we started focusing on a lot more, and it instantly started showing us results. But while I'm talking about just a very simple example and everybody should be doing it, that is true even when you have a particular app which has multiple products and many product lines. It's the same principle that applies there, and that's where I think the largest amount of delta that happens that people don't know really why are we not able to cross-pollinate or cross-sell, and so on, and so forth.

(00:19:14):
Right now, I'm working with a company called Jupiter which is a financial services app, and it's a neobank. So we care for personal finance, and it has a bunch of offerings. There's a personal account or savings account. There's a credit card. There's mutual funds. There is investments in, say, gold, and FD, and so on, and so forth. It's a bunch of things. But when people think about why using us only for one service and just go away, actually, the key is to recognize that this user has found value in... They are not interested in all the other things that you talked about, so be able to empathize with that user, and now thinking about the behavioral science aspects in terms of, "How do I convert this user from one to the other?" That I think is extremely important.

Lenny (00:20:00):
So a couple things I'm hearing here. One is the importance of focusing on not people currently using your product, but this idea of maybe the marginal user or the adjacent user, the next state of users is who you should be thinking about when you're trying to optimize onboarding the user experience, and then two is... Something that sounds like you've had a lot of success with is picking one value prop, maybe one positioning statement, and then following that through their entire journey versus like, "Here's all the things we do." Is that right?

Anuj Rathi (00:20:31):
That's absolutely right. Let me give an example of this one. One of the reasons why I really feel product managers must, if not better, but equally understand, category consumers which are not in market or which are not really buying your products just yet. As good as the marketer or the brand expert in your team does... because they really are tasked with, "What is that one message that I can say that will make the user take attention or get to like, 'Oh, this is interesting,' and direct attention towards your product?" If the product managers are able to do that, then they will choose that positioning and essentially, understand, "What is my hope product, and what is the hope that..." At least get them to try my app or any of those things, right? So if they understand it as well as the marketer, and then understand, "Over a period of time, what is the right time when I introduce them to this other one rather than being very greedy about letting the new user try everything?" So that's one.

(00:21:37):
The other thing that I feel a lot of product managers don't do right is... "Forget about everything. Here's my app. Go figure," is how most of the products are designed unfortunately. Automatically, these things will happen without any intervention. I have created something which is so beautiful, and once you tap that icon, everyone can say, "That is my product that is so working perfectly," but they don't really think about, "At what moment do I actually get this user here, and will they use it?" Well, this user is lazy, vain, and selfish.

Lenny (00:22:09):
That phrase reminds me of something I always think about. Marc Andreessen had this great quote that your user's time is already allocated. They're not looking for more apps to download. They already have a plan for the day. Basically, they have things to do. They're not like, "Hmm, what's another iPhone app I'm going to check out right now?" So somehow you have to convince them, "This is worth your time," and I like this framework. Is there an example of a phrase you found really effective either at Swiggy, or Jupiter, or Flipkart, or anything just like, "Here's a really quick example of something that had a big impact on either simplifying the value prop," or if you don't have an example top of mind, what was the impact you saw from implementing some of these ideas?

Anuj Rathi (00:22:48):
I'll talk about a phrase that I now use with product managers a lot to simplify how they should be thinking. I think one thing is... and that's not only for the consumers, but even how we operate. We are product managers, and we are in the business of influence. Users are doing something, and now we want them to do something else. Our engineers are doing something, and now we want to influence them into building something fast. Really, leadership has some plans. We'll influence them to, essentially, look at a plan, and basically, sign off, and do something else. We are in the business of influence, and you are doing this all the time internally. Otherwise, you're not successful even in shipping. Now, we have to extend this to our users and really think about it from that point of view. So you are a full-stack influencer and not only an external influencer. So we've got to think more like sales, more like marketing, more like influencers.

Lenny (00:23:42):
One of the most important skills for a product manager is influencing people on team, and I like the point that you're also trying to influence your user. That's interesting. Just more reason to get really good at influence, so. I actually have a newsletter about how to get better influence based on Frodo Baggins and Lord of the Rings. We'll link to that in the show notes. Okay. Let's shift to a different topic. You have a really concrete way of actually implementing the working backwards process. We had one of the authors of the book Working Backwards on recently, and I'm excited to just hear what you've learned about how to actually put this into practice. It's easy to hear about, "Let's work backwards," but doing it is a different beast, and so I'd love to hear what you've learned there.

Anuj Rathi (00:24:20):
So I think the people who invented working backwards is clearly Amazon. I think they started this entire process which are like, "Hey, why don't you write a press release, and with that press release, we'll work backwards from that one?" I thought that was a very cool idea, and I was trying to dig down into like, "Hey, why does it work?" My insight or at least the way that I thought about this one is it's not working backwards only from a customer value proposition. "Will our customers love it, and will they pay for it? Is it noteworthy, and is it something that we should even be working?" While that is one of the most important things that the Working Backwards framework teaches us, but essentially, what you're working backwards from is an entire machinery at a particular day that is working for... For the date of GTM, what do we need to do from here till that particular day so that the GTM is successful, but also, what will be the machinery we would have created so that this product is successful?

(00:25:20):
Now, because you're already talking about GTM, you're already thinking about, "How will users love it? What is the money that we'll spend? What are the alternatives that we will... routes that we have explored that finally we have zeroed in on and all of those?" So they are all going to be a part of a PR review. If I take a slightly open stance on this one, what is a press release? A press release is you have a one-pager which talks about what are we building, what is a particular date, what is the exact value proposition, what will consumers say, what will the business manager say, how will they respond, how will they use it. But the one thing that comes out from this framework is that you can use it for a whole bunch of other things. You can use it for negotiation, for example, because you start with a date, and then you say, "This is the one-pager that I need to ship, and I want the consumers to see that." You can use it to now go to our VP Engineering and say, "By this date, can we build all of this?" Now, they do not have all the PRDs and everything, but they can give you a sense that this is too aggressive or this is not and so on.

(00:26:18):
We can also use the quotes here to actually find alliances or find people who are going to actually derail this. So you actually use the customer quote to basically say, "I want my customers to say this. From marketing and from my pricing team, can we actually ship this so that consumers will say that?" Then, from the business owner's quote, you actually say, "This is what we are shipping, but what are your goals? Can you say that within three months, we would have achieved this much?" So using that to build one entire picture is one way that I found it really powerful because if you find disagreements here, then say, "I can't ship it," then you change the date, and then you change the goals because all of these things are changing together. So instead of one, you find the other set of all the things that need to come together for that press release to go live is the real value.

(00:27:07):
The other part that I found interesting here is that I really truly believe in the power of three. So I actually ask my teams to write three press releases, alternative and divergent like, "What if we..." Suppose you're launching a membership program. So, instead of two tiers, let's do three tiers, or for example, let's take another one which is instead of building a membership, let's build up tiering pricing program with membership points. Instead of this segment, let's use another segment. Let's say within these three, and they all need to be fully thought-through, and that helps the leadership choose.

(00:27:44):
So the two things that work here. When you are in the product discovery phase, you would have heard from a lot of folks. Finally, if you show them just one roadmap, it feels like, "Hey, this person didn't..." They listened to my interesting point which was valuable, but didn't include it. But when you're doing this three PR FAQs, I considered this, and this added up to a story that eventually is valuable, this alternative route. I considered your point of view, and I created a story, but unfortunately, it is not adding up so we rejected it. So, now, people can compare and contrast, and that's a very powerful leadership tool. That, actually, is a very powerful tool even for CXOs. When they say, "Let's build this," you'll say, "Here are three ways we can build this, and here's the reason why I'm not building what you said because you would like these two more."

Lenny (00:28:36):
That's a really cool idea of just using the PR FAQ and working backwards process to think very differently partly to make sure you've explored all the options, partly to just think through things that are in the back of people's minds and see if there's something there before committing to the one direction.

Anuj Rathi (00:28:51):
So the FAQs also are very important to set processes in the system. For example, now, at Jupiter, we have a financial services app. So every FAQ will mandatorily have, "How are you going to make sure that it is fully compliant? Have you gotten sign-off from A, B, C people? Have you actually thought about legal aspects, and so on, and so forth?" So, for example, you can use the FAQs very effectively here. Whereas, for example, when it was Swiggy, and it's a three-way marketplace, you have consumers, delivery executives, and restaurant partners. Now, any small change that you do on, say, delivery partners, for example, if you're working on optimizing their earnings per hour which will lead to some changes in cost per delivery, but that may have a completely different impact on delivery fee.

(00:29:31):
I'm just making this up, but now, because of so many moving parts in your FAQs, you're explicitly asking, "Have you thought about what are the implications on restaurant partners? Have you thought about what are implications on delivery partners?" We, in fact, also have that PR FAQ in terms of we write down the different segments of delivery partners, and sometimes it will have extremely weird correlations because those product managers on one side of the equation have started thinking or at least consulting the other part of the marketplace, "What could this mean for you?" It gets everybody together to create very crisp products that work for all sides of the marketplace.

Lenny (00:30:10):
One thread I'm pulling out of a few of your stories so far is you often come back to this full-stack approach to many models. So you talked about how PM is like an influencer, but also, they're influencing users. That's a cool way of thinking about it. With this working backwards process, you can use it to think about the full stack of launch, not just what features you're going to build. I know you also have some strong opinions about product managers, and they should be much more full-stack than most PMs. Does that ring a bell, and if so, can you talk about that?

Anuj Rathi (00:30:39):
Yes. No, I think it is the same thread that is connecting the first and the second. I think product managers have to own outcomes and not only features and parts of the problem. Well, they will own some parts of the problem fully, but if they need to work with everybody to make sure that eventual product that they launch is successful and not only successful from the point of view of, "Hey, we launched something that works for users," et cetera, that's not the definition of success. Did it work in the way that it really changed the behavior of the kind of user that we wanted to achieve a business outcome that will build a capability that is important for us? All of those things combined will not happen if the product manager is only thinking about their part. So they have to think about external users, they have to think about competition, they have to think about other product managers and product leaders about engineering, about marketing, and so on because it's such a diverse field.

(00:31:36):
Unless you really... and I'm not saying you need to be an authority of that. Either you are very, very good at that, or you have built partnerships, and have run your ideas or product through those people and gotten weighted from them, and finally made a decision around that part, I don't think you'll be very successful. So, in my opinion, the full-stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more successful rather than product managers who are doing very good at one particular area only. So there's one book which is Range, right? I'm sure you may have heard about it, right? Even the first chapter, what they talk about is... They take two examples. One is the example of Federer, Roger Federer. So, with Roger Federer, for example, I think I'll just continue that, that till 18, he played a bunch of racket sports, and this wasn't even tennis. But then, you bring in ideas from one racket sport to the other, and second to the third, and so on, and so forth, and now you have such a range of ideas that you can connect a lot more dots and actually ship it. I think that's a better playbook for being more successful in product.

Lenny (00:32:41):
I was just watching a documentary on... I think it was called Greatness and had Wayne Gretzky. He had exactly the same experience actually. When he was young, he played hockey just during the winter times, and during summer, he played other sports. Hockey was just like one sport he played, and then eventually started to focus on it, and they talked about how people that played different sports in their childhood actually ended up being much better at that one sport that they chose. So a lot of parallels. I know you also have a lot of interesting ways of thinking about coming up with a roadmap ideas, and ideating and building a roadmap backlog. So you already talked about this idea of going in very divergent directions and seeing if that leads anywhere. There's a couple more someone shared. One is you have this idea of show don't tell. What is that?

Anuj Rathi (00:33:27):
Actually, show don't tell is an idea which is an extension of what we are talking about from what backwards. When we're talking about working backwards, one is a PR FAQ which is a written documentation of what we are trying to achieve. Show don't tell is essentially a way in where the product manager starts ideating with the entire experience, and they actually create all the collaterals together of a user they need to begin with if you're working on a single-play product which is a single-user product. Then, you actually start bringing together your marketers and others in terms of, "What is literally the first screen, and how is my user getting here?" It's not as simple as he imagines somebody who will be doing this and reaching here. We try to recreate an exact situation.

(00:34:16):
There's a concept of person, not personas. So we'll talk about personas, but we try to go to, "All right. No. Don't think about agentic user. Let's say Lenny, 30 years old, doing A, B, C things, earning this much, et cetera, et cetera. His relationship with this category of food delivery is X. These are the things that he has done in the last month. In the last three days, there were the needs, desires, aspirations, fears, frustrations, et cetera, et cetera." We say, "Okay. It's 11:00. What's happened? Why is this user open, or what triggered this particular app, and then what happened?" So you literally start from there, and I think 50% of my product reviews are on that part, and then when we say, "All right. Then, this app got open. Do we have the right kind of way forward for Lenny to actually achieve what he came here for?" Literally, each pixel, and each copy, and each word is going to be in service of that part.

(00:35:08):
So that's showing the entire journey rather than just staying and assuming. So that is something that I've found really powerful with respect to even designing products or even thinking about why are we building something. What it also helps is when we are building complex products, especially in marketplaces because once you are building this for the user, simultaneously, something is happening on the other part if it is simultaneous, if it's a real-time marketplace, or something like that. So you're building something for the user and saying, "All right. If this guy ordered, now there's a 30 minutes time when our delivery executors will come to the user with food. What is happening? What's the emotional state of the user, and let's plot out the 30 minutes time, and let's create various scenarios. Is it like, 'Hey, maybe he went to the restaurant, and the food is delayed,' or the dude on a bike, his bike got punctured, et cetera. Now, what is the consumer thinking at this time?" So you show all of those things in real time, and that cuts out a whole bunch of random ways in which the product could have looked like if you're creating even a chatbot. So just having that showcase of all journeys coming together helps a lot in building your products in the right way.

Lenny (00:36:19):
So, essentially, just getting very detailed and very concrete with the product experience that you're building thinking about the user experience. Sounds like a lot of work. I can't imagine you do this often. Is the advice here to do this once a year or once and just keep it updated? It sounds like you did this at Swiggy, and that was a really impactful way of building the product.

Anuj Rathi (00:36:41):
Yeah. I think there's not only one way actually. I think I recommend this every product manager to do a show don't tell version of their current version. At the same time, there's a new version all the time. So they can compare and contrast, and very easily explain to everyone why they're doing something. In fact, that wall... So it's called a wall. It also becomes one common place where you can get all the stakeholders in because it becomes... Instead of just doing the elevator pitch, you can actually do detailed discussions on why I'm choosing this versus something else, and so on, and so forth. That's a product manager's version of doing this.

(00:37:10):
There's also a product leader's version of doing this thing which is recycle strategy on a page, and a lot of people call it like growth loops. Right? Don't show our user's journey. Now, let's see the entire strategy of the company together on one page. "All right. This is what the market looks like, and why will we get what kind of users? What is our activation budgets, and how many of them are we going to get to this next stage and get them to use it? How will we get them to cross-pollinate into different sections? Do we need a membership program? Are there any different levers which will press more or less and so on?" So that also is a show don't tell, and not only one, but usually, I like to create three of them as well like, "Why did we choose a strategy versus the other?" That, for example, is a very good way for our product leaders to get to one strategy that their CXOs align with and something that they can essentially tell the entire product and other teams, "This is what we're going to follow."

Lenny (00:38:09):

Find out more at wix.com/studio.

(00:39:14):
What kind of impact have you seen from implementing something like this, or is there an example of something that came out of this that was a big unlock? Again, it's probably a lot of work for someone to put together a whole board, keep it updated, screenshots, marketing, funnels of where people are coming from. What sort of impact do you see from doing this either on growth or people, what people think?

Anuj Rathi (00:39:34):
I think the largest impact that happens here is on alignment, so how CXOs are thinking if that is not very clear, and that can be a document, and so on, and so forth. But for a lot of people, it's not very clear on... I can see one part of the funnel. I can understand... The marketing team can understand the best why we are acquiring those users, but they don't fully see the picture of, "If I attract this kind of users, why will these users become loyal, and what does that entire thing look like or, say, some other team which is building a part of the product? Where do I come in and so on?" So I think the largest impact that the show don't tell has is on, basically, getting the entire company together on the same page and them being able to understand why I'm doing, and which part of the entire picture I am working on, and why others are working on so that I can actually work with them to solve that part. That's one.

(00:40:30):
The other thing that it helps, Lenny, is it also helps in choosing directions, like I said, because we are not doing one, but three of them. I'm choosing one alternative versus the other, and sometimes these strategic discussions, they can get going all sorts of different ways, and maybe you will talk about one particular unique point and go deeper rather than look at the entire picture together and say, "This is good because of all of these five points that we presented in page one versus the other one."

Lenny (00:41:01):
I think the other benefit, just one of the benefits of working backwards in Amazon's whole written-down memo approach is it forces you to crystallize ideas and not stay superficial because there's so many good ideas in theory. But then, when you have to get really concrete, that's actually a terrible idea. Basically, it's the same benefit in a lot of ways of get very concrete. What are you actually going to do? That will help you identify, "Okay. This isn't going to work. What are we even thinking?" So I like that. Awesome. Okay. Another framework that you have is something that you call the four BB framework for product strategy. Can you talk about what that's all about?

Anuj Rathi (00:41:36):
We essentially saw that if a startup actually usually wants to do a bunch of things across the border, there's always like, "Hey, I should be investing in tech debt or building core platforms. That would really help my product in the long term. That's super important," and that's my engineering managers and largely, people asking for that bandwidth. Then, there is the product manager themselves who's basically saying, "I want to do feature enhancement, bug fixes, my version twos, a few areas, experiments, and so on, and so forth." That's a regular product backlog that would work on screen by screen, and there's this leadership which will say, "You know what? Now, we have a suite of products. Now, I want to take a large delta bit that may work. It may not work, but we need to make sure that it works, but I need work across teams, and it's not only one person that needs to do it. I need contribution from four or five of you that come together and deliver that," or there are places where a company is just reimagining their identity, or they're pivoting which is like, "All right. We were doing X. Now, we are doing X plus Y. That's how we want to be known," or, "We were doing X. Now, we want to do very little of X because current consumers, okay, we will take care of them, but now we want to pivot into Y."

(00:42:55):
So it usually is in four of these buckets, and what really happens is it gets down to product managers eventually prioritizing between these four. So I don't think it's a tactical prioritization product manager call. It really is a product strategy call, and the conversation that needs to happen is between, say, the head of product and the CEO or even the leadership. If I gave you a hundred focus points, how much will you put in each of these buckets, and what are those four buckets? Those are the four BB buckets, so what are the ones? We call them... First BB is Brilliant Basics. The reason why we call it BB, Brilliant Basic, you need to brand... You cannot brand it as tech debt, so it feels like very off because these are brilliant, these are important. That's what the company's built on, and the company needs to invest in that. So that's one.

(00:43:46):
The second one is Bread and Butter. So that's your backlogs. If the product managers had no big ideas, and they just were left on their own, what would they come up with in terms of just improving that line of business that they're given? Then, there are Big Bets. Now, that's where your larger ideas that have come together, but how many big bets should we take, or is this big bet even a big one? That's where you're working backwards or PR FAQs start becoming even more important because those are the kind of bets that cannot be taken without everybody basically signing up, working backwards, and saying, "We will all make this successful."

(00:44:26):
Breaking Bad essentially is a different world altogether. That's where you want to redefine your company. For example, in Swiggy, if we were doing food delivery, now we want to do grocery delivery as well. It's like these are two companies working together, or from a food delivery company, we wanted to become a convenience company. So that's almost breaking bad. Again, like I said, we got cheesy, but the good thing that happens is now what you can do is, along with your leadership, take stock, and the head of product essentially can say, "You know what? In the next year, I can invest a lot less on my brilliant basics, and we should as a company focus a lot on this breaking back because that is existential." But then, we should not look back and say, "Why were tech systems a little bit broken this time? We had a little bit more down times."

(00:45:17):
You can basically blow it out and almost showcase what to expect. For example, if we are just working on a whole bunch of bread and butters, so you'll start seeing a lot fewer bugs, customers will be a little happier. You worked a lot more... drill in basics. Tech systems are nice, but you didn't create any differentiators. Well, none of your bets went out, and your competitors are catching up. So does that sound like a better future? These are hard questions, and these privatization questions... I don't think of product management questions so much as product strategy questions, but in a lot of cases, executors don't know what they're trading off against.

(00:45:53):
So if you are able to create the conversation around which buckets do we want to put in and create three alternatives... I have tried to do that a bunch of times. Let's look at strategy A, and we see how to be divergent. Suppose we were putting a lot fewer focus points in brilliant basics and a lot more on, for example, big bets, then there will be a risk that they will be like, "We won't have any experiments or very less experiments. Bugs will stay bugs, but we will get a shot at changing the game." Is that a future that sounds better or something else which is like because you're pained also by a lot of bugs and constant down times, which is more secure, but we won't build something amazing, so which sounds better? Because you are able to drive that, now the clarity to the product managers is way clearer in terms of what will they do. Also, they would know that if they have been signed up for a big bet, then they will need to contribute to the PR FAQ. They will need to contribute to the actual working on that irrespective of what their product was, but now they're part of something bigger.

Lenny (00:47:03):
Awesome. I love it. Okay. So just to summarize so people can have just a very short definition of this framework. Brilliant Basics is essentially tech debt and things that you just have to do like hygiene almost. Bread and Butter is essentially optimizing the product, existing product. Big Bets are big bets, and Breaking Bad are just future big rocket like moon shots just transform the way the business works?

Anuj Rathi (00:47:29):
That's right.

Lenny (00:47:30):
I love it. It's also interesting. Another thread that comes up again and again in your advice is exploring all the options before committing to one like you always... I think it sounds like you always try to recommend three. I guess let me say what I always find is important there is I think it's important for the product manager to recommend one along with that. It's not just like, "Here's three. You tell me which one you do." It's like, "Here's three. Here's my recommendation why." Is that your advice too, or do you see something-

Anuj Rathi (00:47:53):
100%, 100%. So when you have explored the three, you essentially have done the work one like, "I have covered all bases and also crystallized them into a concrete option. Now, I'm choosing one on the company's behalf on the basis of whatever I know about the market, about the company, about our strategy, and about how we will make it successful." Now, if I miss something, it's also a time where you can actually work with leadership and other product managers to essentially get that knowledge complete, or if you're 80% right, you can actually use elements of strategy two and strategy three to bring into one. So that's always the way that your thing that... one very concrete option, but because you have these other tools so that you're not missing and bringing it together. But ultimately, you're the one who is going to champion this, and that's where the other leadership element of Amazon comes in which is disagree and commit. But once we have aligned on this one, we'll all commit to launching this, and then the leadership should not go back and forth on that part.

Lenny (00:48:59):
Awesome. I want to go in a completely different direction. It feels like you have a lot of contrarian opinions about how to build product, and how to build teams, and build companies, and things like that, so I just want to start broad. What are some things you have contrarian opinions about, things you believe that a lot of other people maybe don't believe or seek differently?

Anuj Rathi (00:49:19):
So one, for example, excellence and speed. There's always a question around that. "Hey, would you rather ship faster, or would you rather ship better?" In my opinion, when you have to make a choice, think more and ship better. Most experiments should be thought experiments. They should not even be tried out because they're obviously going to fail which is contrary to, "Let's try it out, and then let's see." I think that wastes a lot of company time. If you had smart people who could do metathinking, a lot of experiments would just not even be like... It's not a rule, but it's a preference. I think speed and excellence are two different axes. Ideally, you should be better at both, but if you had to choose one, choose excellence.

(00:50:04):
There's another contrarian opinion which is... I think most product managers, and again, I'm probably talking a little bit of the kind of people that I work with and have interacted with in product. Most product managers should not even be product managers. They should think a little bit more around whether this is actually the right field for them because I think a lot of people from other areas have entered the field without fully realizing what it takes. So there is definitely a way in which you can coach yourself, and then work your way upwards of that one, but it can make you quite miserable if it's not right for you.

Lenny (00:50:49):
Is there something folks should look for there that will tell them you probably shouldn't be a product manager? Either motivation, or skill set, or background, or anything?

Anuj Rathi (00:50:55):
No. I don't think about particular domains that you come from. I have, again, a simple framework of three. I think the first thing is essentially raw sharps, and that can manifest itself into problem identification and problem solving. That's one, and also, higher-order thinking and all of that. I think that is super important. The second one is what I call drive or grit. I think with that comes a whole bunch of qualities around curiosity, learnability, never giving up, consumer-backward thinking, "I really want to solve this," and all of that that comes with that. Third, which is a little difference, we talked about that, is influence. You're in the business of influence, and if you can see yourself that, "I'm built this way," or, "I want to really get better at these," that's when I think this field is going to serve you well.

Lenny (00:51:45):
I love that everything is three. How handy.

Anuj Rathi (00:51:48):
Only the BBs are four. I wish I could compress them three.

Lenny (00:51:51):
Yeah. There's too many things to do there. Essentially, these are maybe your perspective on the most important PM skills. A good way to think about it. Influence, grit, and just being smart.

Anuj Rathi (00:52:02):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:52:03):
I think what you said here is not like you have to be amazing at these to get into product and do well. It's you need to be excited about getting better at these skills.

Anuj Rathi (00:52:10):
Yes. That's right.

Lenny (00:52:12):
Awesome.

Anuj Rathi (00:52:12):
Well, I think it's not as if that everybody is born with a lot of influence. Of course, you can get better at it, but it's a prospect of that, "Hey, I will need to be influential to succeed at this job." That should excite you and not scare you away. You should not think like, "Hey, you know what? I can get away from this and still be very successful product manager," because most likely, you will not.

Lenny (00:52:34):
Maybe spending a little more time here. So, smart, you're probably not going to be able to do a lot about. In terms of grit or influence, is there anything you can share about what you've seen most helps people develop at these skills other than just doing the job for a while, and then starting to get better at this?

Anuj Rathi (00:52:49):
Yeah. I think even smartness, I think 80% of that smartness, I think, is something that's very achievable. You don't need to be outstanding on that. Domain knowledge, for example, is something just like... An average smart person with no domain knowledge versus you armed with a lot of knowledge around domain and so on can already take you there, but you can take better decisions. I think first one is more about decision-making, problem identification, problem solving, and all of that. So I think that really can be developed at least to a level where you are very effective. Drive, I think, is probably the hardest to coach, probably the hardest. I've not seen people with less drive actually eventually turning out with a lot of drive, et cetera, but they can be inspired. I think you need to be a person who can think about it that way, but the third one, influences, I think, there's no negotiation there. You need to really think that, "I have to be good at this one."

(00:53:46):
There's another framework that, Lenny, I wanted to talk about. When I look at product leadership in general and how do you think about different people and so on. When is it a product manager problem, or your problem, or a company problem? There are only three reasons, again, why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem, that you didn't set up the ways of working now design properly, or we are okay as such and such, and so on, and so forth.

(00:54:26):
So, as a leader, it's almost the opposite of what we talked about, great influence and raw sharps. Do you have the right people in terms of capability? If not, is the right answer for us to coach them or to really put them... or mentor them and so on, or move them to some other place because maybe their capability is suited elsewhere? If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you? Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not just have enough time? So on and so forth. So you need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?

(00:55:05):
There are different answers for that, but if it's a setup issue, and at least I've realized that apart from what product managers can do, almost 70%, 80% of problems why things don't happen are a setup issue. Product leaders or other leaders have not thought through what OKRs are doing to my company, not really fully thought through around org design. If you've read the book called TEEN Topologies, that's one interesting book which starts with Conway's law and essentially saying, "Show me an engineering architecture, and I will actually tell you what the org design of this company is," but that also manifests itself in products that you can basically look at a product. In most cases, you will be able to say what was org design that led to this kind of product.

Lenny (00:55:51):
I have heard that book mentioned a couple of times recently. I got to check it out just to the three you just shared, which is another three. I love it. Can do, won't do. What was the third one again, didn't do?

Anuj Rathi (00:56:01):
Not set up to do.

Lenny (00:56:03):
Not set up to do. That one is long. That's a long one. I think what's cool about these are they're essentially ways to measure performance. Maybe if you're a product manager, like performance reviews, it's like, "Did you have the skills to do this? Did you have the motivation to do this, or is it something not set up for you?" You weren't set up for success, basically?

Anuj Rathi (00:56:20):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:56:21):
Okay. Let's go to AI corner, something I'm trying to do with every guest. Is there anything you've learned about working with AI that you think might be helpful to listeners?

Anuj Rathi (00:56:31):
Yeah. I think a couple of things. I think working with AI, many, many teams and companies get too excited about AI, and the possibilities, and so on, and it's almost like a solution ready to find a problem within their companies, which also is fine because now you're thinking about possibilities on what this particular technology can do for my company. So it's a good way to start, but many people don't actually use it in the best way possible and force fit it. Instead of that, you can think about, "How do I get AI to work with HI?" Again, it's connecting back with... and this is something that Swiggy CEO, Sriharsha, invented this term called HI just to make sure that everybody understands.

(00:57:13):
Artificial intelligence is important as much as human intelligence. If you're not humanly intelligent, you're not going to be artificially intelligent or AI really help your company a lot. So, literally, any product that you're building, even when it is technologically quite interesting, and exciting, and so on, it needs to be balanced out and work together along with a great UX, along with behavioral science. The combination of those two will actually make sure that you're getting the best outcome of that, unless you are building something which is completely backed and with no human interventions. We're talking about consumer products largely.

Lenny (00:57:51):
You've helped build some of the most successful marketplaces in India and in the world. I'm curious just what may be a lesson or two about building a successful marketplace?

Anuj Rathi (00:58:02):
One thing that I would definitely want to talk about is when you're thinking marketplaces, it's not as a one plus one equals two, it multiplies. We're thinking about three-way marketplaces. You almost not need to think like it's a two-dimensional plane going into three-dimension. It becomes that amount of complexity, and your regular product management and leadership principles start failing. So a bunch of usual suspects will not work. Let me give an example. OKRs will not work. Why not? So, fundamentally, OKRs are a way to think about objectives and key results, but the fundamental assumption here is that it is solving for a kind of user, and that kind of user, you can divide and conquer. Of course, there will be a little bit of tussle between different teams, but you can get them to work with each other. But if it is working for three different kinds of users, then all the goals will all the time be in conflict with each other.

Lenny (00:59:00):
What are examples of the three users? There's like the delivery person, the restaurant-

Anuj Rathi (00:59:04):
The end user. So if you have... I'll give you an example of. On the consumer side, we need to collect more delivery fee. What does that really mean for those other two? On the restaurant side, hey, we need to get more commissions because profitability is a goal. On the delivery partner side, it means pay them less or optimize a little bit more. But once you start moving one lever, those two are already stretched towards the other directions. They're not independent levers in the first place, and the way to even model them out... How will it work? What if we choose X versus what... Ys will change. Y on Z. Z will change. It's almost impossible to do that.

# Microsoft CPO: If you aren’t prototyping with AI you’re doing it wrong | Aparna Chennapragada

## Transcript

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:00):
I have a cheesy Chrome extension. Literally whenever I open a new tab, it just says, how can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:06):
How do you see the future of product development being different?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:09):
If you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong. It becomes even more important to have that territorial and taste-making at the heart of it because, otherwise, you just have a Frankenstein product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
There's this acronym that you taught me, NLX. What is that?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:00:26):
Natural language interface. NLX is the new UX. Often I hear a product builders say, "Oh, yeah. With AI, the model eats the products." That doesn't mean it's not designed. You and I are having a conversation. It's a podcast. I'll have another conversation at Microsoft and that's a meeting. Conversations also have grammars. They have structures. They have UI elements. They're invisible. What are the new principles, new constructs in natural language as an interface?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I just saw that Cursor hit 300 million ARR in two years. Interestingly, you guys were very well positioned to do really well in this AI coding tool space. You guys had Copilot, the first tool in the world at this stuff. So ahead of everyone, what happened?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:01:06):
I would say...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
Today my guest is Aparna Chennapragada. Aparna is chief product officer at Microsoft where she oversees AI product strategy for their productivity tools and their work on agents. Previously, she was chief product officer at Robinhood, vice president at Google, where she worked on Google lens, search, shopping, augmented reality, AI assistant, and a lot more. She was also a long-time engineering leader at Akamai, and on the board of eBay and Capital One.

(00:01:32):
In our conversation, we chat about how working in B2B is like being Jean-Claude Van Damme doing the splits across two moving trucks, how she's operationalizing her team living in the future so that they're building towards where things are going, why people still need to learn to code, why the PM role isn't going anywhere, why NLX is the new UX, and so much more.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:04:35):
Thank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:37):
When I asked a lot of people that work with you, what I should ask you about and what I should know about you, something that came up again and again, it's something that I think most people don't know about you, which is that you're big into stand-up comedy, and you take it semi-seriously. Just how serious are you about this? How much of your life is this and most importantly, how does this help you build better products?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:04:59):
It's hard to say I'm serious about a funny business, but I do watch and do stand-up comedy. I do open mics. I've done a few shows.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):
Wow.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:05:09):
I have one set brewing that is around AI, unsurprisingly AI and tech and Silicon Valley. It's really interesting for me. This was an accidental discovery. I had always been an SNL fan and Discovery fan, but I went to an open mic because my son sings, and he went to the open mic for singing and he is like, "Mom, you should go do this." And I was like, "Oh, let me go give it a try," and I found that I enjoyed it and was good at it. To your question though, about building better products, I'd say both have PMF, I mean, product market fit, punchline market fit.

(00:05:49):
Actually, there are a couple of things that I do find really powerful and useful because in open mics or even when you're testing these things, it's a very tight cycle of iteration, and you get live... Open mics are the real live experiments. You put something out there, you get very clear micro feedback from users, and then you get tough feedback sometimes. And I think as product builders, that's actually one of the great skills to have, which is you sometimes launch stuff that have a fantastic vision, but the first version is not quite there. And Reid Hoffman says this, "Hey, if you don't launch the first version and are not embedded, you're doing it too slow." Just that gap in closing that, it's good resilience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:30):
Yeah. I never saw these corollaries between these two things. I didn't realize you actually did shows, and you're working on a set. I wasn't going to ask you for a joke, but if you're working on a whole thing about AI, is there something that you can share from that set?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:06:43):
One joke I'd maybe share is people think about these AI chat products as women because you don't know what's going on. It's a black box, and you don't know what they're thinking. There's an entire set around that, but obviously on the flip side too, that they're probably more like men in the sense that they hallucinate a lot. They kind of are not yet reliable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:12):
I'm afraid to laugh with this a little bit. This is great.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:16):
And even when they don't know the answer, they make up stuff. They're very confident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):
This is good. Where are we going to be seeing the show by the way?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:22):
TBD.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:24):
Okay. This is great. Okay, let's get serious again. So you worked at most of your career at a lot of consumer internet companies. You worked at Google, Robinhood, you're on the board of eBay, you're on the board of Capital One. Now, you're at Microsoft. I'm curious just what is most different about working at a company like Microsoft and building product at a company like Microsoft?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:07:46):
I think intellectually I knew that, hey, enterprise, particularly the area that I look at most at Microsoft is focused on enterprise and productivity and transforming companies through AI. And to me, I think two things really strike as very different. One, in fact, I just posted about this the other day saying, in consumer, you're kind of like, "Oh, we have a playbook for make the product work or make the feature work and make it delightful," but I think in the enterprise, you almost have... Every time you think you have one use case, you have really two, which is how do you make sure that the feature works well and there's governance of the feature.

(00:08:25):
If you think about even something as simple as sharing a link to a document, you want it to be easy, frictionless, but at the same time, you want that to be secure and safe and being able to have auditability and all of those things. And often, I find that when you go from a consumer enterprise, you fall into a trap of either disregarding that and say, "Oh, we'll just focus on one side of the house," or overly crippling the user experience side and leaning on the other side. So I think there's an art and science and nuance and playbook there too, so that's one big learning for me. The other learning, and especially in the AI era for me has been about this... I think there's a famous trailer from the 2000s on Van Damme on these two buses [inaudible 00:09:13] splits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):
Like doing the splits.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:09:14):
Yeah, doing the splits, exactly. I feel like a lot of the companies, including the tech companies, but certainly the enterprises that I talk to are in these two modes where one hand, this is the most compressed tech cycle that we've ever experienced. It's in the order of weeks and months versus years and decades. If you think about mobile and cloud and internet, and there's just so much happening, the intelligence overhang. On the other hand, there's also humans and habits that... Productivity habits change. It's hard to change and change management through the company is also hard. You don't want to be rash on that. So it's like the future is unevenly distributed but even within the companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:59):
On the second bucket of the bus that Van Damme's riding on of governance and adoption and changing behavior and stuff, is there something you've learned about how to get past that, help that along more?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:10:10):
The thing not to do is hold back folks who are early adopters. I think that's the other one learning. In fact, I think that's one of the reasons why recently... I've been working with folks to say, "Can we have both," which is the longer-term change management, being able to do it in a trusted way, at the same time do this program we are calling Frontier program and roll out cutting edge experimental features. We just built this world's first deep research agent made for work, post-trained for work. And of course, it has all sorts of edges, rough edges, but if there are only adopters in an enterprise or outside, how can we put that in the hands of those folks without insisting that all of the company be completely developing different muscles?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:04):
This program Frontier you're talking about, I wanted to spend a little time on it. So what is the idea? The idea here is people are working in this futuristic environment. How does that actually work?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:11:14):
Yeah, I think the idea is exactly this, which is I want to kind of institutionalize and operationalize my personal model of living one year in the future and say, "What does this..." Imagine a company or a setup like Frontier Consulting Group or Frontier Inc., right? And if you did live in that environment where you had all the AI tools and really advanced deep research intelligence on tap, what are the kinds of questions you'd be asking? What's the kind of work you'd be doing? How would you change how you're going about your work day? So that's the premise and you'd say, "Hey, how does it change an individual?" But also down the lane, we want to think about what does a Frontier team look like. We talk a lot about Frontier labs and models. I think models layer is amazing and obviously that's what empowers all these product building to happen, but I want to push us to think about what does a Frontier product look like? And more importantly, how does a Frontier way of working like? What does a team with three people and tons of compute and AI tools look like?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:20):
So how exactly does this work? There's a team within Microsoft that's like your job is to use all of our latest tools and build product using that. Does that work?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:12:29):
That is the setup. We are just a few weeks into that setup, but meanwhile what we have done is we've actually set up a fake company and said, "Hey, if you are somebody who wants to come play with some of the cutting edge science projects and deep research agents and agents at work, come party here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:51):
Wow. And it's only a few weeks in. Okay, so TBD how it all goes.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:12:54):
Yeah. And again, these are micro... Let's see. The meta point here also is that in the traditional way, we've kind of always thought about across the companies, across industries, really thinking about roll-outs in these macro ways. You build something and you kind of roll it out, you have a general availability for, and then you take the time. And that's really important too because, again, we are talking about pharma companies, legal companies relying on this. So we do want to have that. But at the same time, given the compressed cycles of AI, how do we start to have people experience what's the one year in the future?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
Let's follow this thread in a few different directions. There's how product development changes, there's how engineering changes. There's also just agents. I know you're spending a lot of time in agents, feels like you're not an AI company these days if you're not working on agents or building an agent.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:13:42):
Lenny, you're doing this wrong. You didn't use the word agents so far into the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:51):
I try hard to push it out as far as I can. It's like every conversation in San Francisco, it's just like how long until I start talking about AI? It's like three minutes. Average, I bet. Oh, man. Okay, so with agents, I know that you're leading a lot of this work at Microsoft and a lot of people are wondering what the hell does this mean? What is going to change? Give us just a glimpse into how you see the world being different in a world of agents being around more.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:14:18):
There's a short term and there's a long term, right? There's a lot of hyperventilated, excited talk about the eventual future and all of that. I take a much more practical product building lens on this, and I think about these. At the end of the day, there are tools. Yes, underneath it, there's stochastic models versus very deterministic programming models. You can tell I'm a computer scientist like the way that worldview definitely shapes how I think about this. To me, the short term is there's an evolution. We had apps, and now I think we are firmly in the assistance era where there's human driving the... That's what we think of as co-pilot, right? I think the human driving in the driver's seat but having a lot of assistance from AI.

(00:15:07):
So I think of this as then you look at the dimension of almost autonomy and delegation and intelligence. As the intelligence, for example, when deep reasoning unlock happened, of course, then you can delegate more to the agent. So I think, to me, there's one dimension where you say, "Hey, agents are somewhat independent software processes that can kind of run tasks," and you're not just thinking about handholding and fine motor stuff. You're saying, "Hey, here's my goal. Go make this happen." I'll give you an example. So we are working on this researcher agent for work. And last night, I said, "Hey, I have an important meeting coming up with the leadership team. I really want to present these frameworks here and this is the roadmap here. Go back and look at all the people that are in the meeting. What are their views on this topic and come up with how I should I be thinking about the right persuasion pitch here?"

(00:16:07):
And what's magical about this is not just that it's saving time. Typically, we think about the, so far, AI as summarizing a document or saving time. This is like fighting synapses that I didn't quite have and actually giving me new insights and giving me, dare I say, superpowers. So that's a natural evolution of AI, I would say. So when I think about agents, I think about three things. One is an increasing level of autonomy and kind of independence that you can delegate higher and higher order tasks. Second thing I think of it is complexity. So it's not just a one-shot, "Hey, create this image or do this thing or summarize the document," it's build me this prototype that expresses my idea of, say, an augmented reality app. It's a complex task. And then the third thing I would say is asynchronous. It works when you are not working. I think that's the other big thing about these things that you don't have to sit in front of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
This answers the question of what is an agent essentially, these three bullet points. So what are the three again?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:17:10):
When I think about agents, I think about these three things. So one, it's autonomy like being... And it's a spectrum, it's not a zero-one, it's how do I actually delegate things that it can do. Second, I think of as complexity. It's not a one-shot, "Hey, summarize this document, generate this image, but it's build me this prototype or help me knock this meeting out of the park." And then the third one I think of is it's a much more natural interaction. That doesn't just mean chat, but it may be actually jumping on a meeting with the agent and being able to talk through all of it or point it to things that I wanted done differently. So I think all three things, the autonomy, the complexity, and the natural interaction are at least product principles that will shape really good ones, good agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
That is really helpful. Along this line of agents, there's this acronym that you taught me as we were chatting ahead of this podcast, NLX, what is that and how does that relate to agents and why are people not thinking about this enough?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:18:10):
Oh, that's one of my Roman empires these days. The natural language interface. NLX is the new UX. Here's the deal. To me, I think traditionally we've thought very consciously about GUI because the graphical interfaces are not something natural, and so they have had to be explicitly designed, but they're rigid interfaces. What we have with conversational interface and natural language is it's a much more elastic, right? That doesn't mean it's not designed. Often, I hear a product builders say, "Oh, yeah. With AI, the model leads to the product. So it's just you chat with it." You and I are having a conversation, it's a podcast. I'll have another conversation at Microsoft and that's a meeting.

(00:18:59):
So conversations also have grammars, they have structures, they have UI elements, they're invisible. And so one of the things that I see and I'm really excited about is what are the new principles, new constructs in natural language as an interface? I'll give you a few examples. And actually a lot of startups as well as big companies are really experimenting with this stuff. One is if you think about it, prompt itself is a new construct and that's a new UI element just like a dropdown was or a menu was. But others that are emerging, especially for agents, I think are plans. So when you give a high level goal, what we are seeing is that when the agent comes back with a plan, preferably an editable plan, that's a new construct.

(00:19:44):
The other one that I think about a lot is showing the work, progress. You see this with different products. You see with the Copilot, you see with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, this idea of thinking aloud and it's kind of showing the work, but how much do you do it? If it's too verbose, it feels like I'm running some cron job and scripts, but if it's too terse, then I don't know if it's going in the right path, and I don't have the confidence yet. So there are all these new elements. So if you are a product whittler, this is a fun new space to be digging in for product design.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
This is really interesting because I think people chat with all these chat bots and it just feels like this is just the way it is, but you actually are designing every element of the interaction, how much to share, but how much you're thinking, here's my plan, what do you think. So I think this will surprise a lot of people, just realizing there's so much that goes into just designing even these what seemingly are simple conversations.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:20:47):
Yeah. Another good example is follow-ups, right? You could say, "Look, you asked me a question," and then I could ask a follow-up set of things, and that's explicitly should be designed for success. So for example, if I said, "Hey, create an image," and it created a black and white like a clip art version of something. What are the next obvious follow-ups that it should be suggesting proactively? Now, too much and you are kind of annoying me, but too little in some sense, you've lost an opportunity to direct me or guide me into a happy path here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):
This resonates a lot with when we had Kevin Weil on the podcast, he talked about this question of just how much to show about what you're saying. And it's interesting that DeepSeek went the extreme of just showing everything and people liked it too. I think that was interesting.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:21:39):
Yeah, and I think it's a point in time thing too, Lenny, because in some sense right now these things are such black boxes. They're almost like peeking under the hood for anything. Even if it's verbose feels like, "Oh, I know what's happening," especially because the compute inference time, it's taking long to think. So it just feels like if you just went silent, I'd be very uncomfortable, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:02):
I know.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:22:05):
Exactly. So I do feel like there's that point in time, but over time, I also feel like this is an area ripe for personalization. For example, again in human, my API would be very different from somewhere. My interface is probably different from others, and I might just want the direct, "Hey, give me the TLDR," versus the, "Oh, so I went here and then I went there," and I'm like...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:28):
Following the start a little bit. We're talking about just how the future is going to be different. There's designing for these chat experiences, there's agents, kind of zooming out to just product development in general, it feels like you're at the forefront of a lot of the tools that are going to change the way we build products and also your teams are working with a lot of these tools that no one else has access to. So let me just ask, how do you see the future of product development being different from today most, and what do you think product builders should be preparing for doing to succeed in that future?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:22:59):
I'll start with one stark statement that I say internally and externally, and I am trying to live it is that in this day and age, if you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong. I call it the prompt sets of the new PRDs. I really insist on folks saying if you're building new projects, new features of course come with prototypes and prompt sets. And I think the notion is not to say, "Hey, now everybody's just a biggest version of a software engineer." It is to say you have the fastest path to seeing and experiencing what's in your mind to be able to communicate, right? It's a much more high bandwidth way of communication. I think about that as a really a loop accelerator in terms of product building. That's number one. When in doubt, as someone put it, demos before memos, right? I think that's really number one.

(00:24:04):
I would say number two, this one is a little bit tricky I'd say, is that what I'm seeing is that the time to first demo is much shorter, but the time to a full deployment is going to take longer. So I think that there's going to be an uneven cadence. So typically, I think there was much more of a you've been this thing, you take a few weeks and then you can iterate and so on. But that inner loop of prototyping and iterating and getting even user research through AI conversations, all of that gets shortened. But I think the bar for scale, therefore becomes much high. In some sense, if you look at it, there's going to be a supply of ideas, a massive increase in supply of ideas in prototypes which is great. It raises the floor, but it raises the ceiling as well. In some sense, how do you break out in these times that you have to make sure that this is something that rises above the noise? So I would say that it's simultaneously thinking about not chasing after every idea. I think is the second one.

(00:25:14):
I'd say the third thing is there's a lot of conversation around full stack builders. What does the team of the future look like? A product building team. What I think about is I think that is inevitable in terms of there will be a few folks that are, especially at the prototyping early idea discovery stage that the lines of blurred, there'll be a few taste makers at the same time. I think you can still have a lot of people experimenting. It becomes even more important to have that editorial and taste making in a Frontier, one or a few at the heart of it because otherwise you just have Frankenstein product. That definitely doesn't change.

(00:25:58):
I have one other additional bonus thing, which is a lot of folks think about, "Oh, don't bother studying computer science or the coding is dead," and I just fundamentally disagree. If anything, I think we've always had higher and higher layers of abstraction in programming. We don't program in assembly anymore. Most of us don't even program in C, and then you're kind of higher and higher layers of abstraction. So to me, they will be ways that you will tell the computer what to do, right? It'll just be at a much higher level of abstraction, which is great. It democratizes. There'll be an order of magnitude more software operators. Instead of Cs, maybe we'll have SOs, but that doesn't mean you don't understand computer science and it's a way of thinking and it's a mental model. So I strongly disagree with the whole coding is dead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):
That's awesome. I love that. And SO is a software operator, what is that? What that stands for?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:27:00):
Yeah, I just made it up but yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:04):
Okay, cool. This idea of prototyping as being kind of core to building these days, is there anything you do within Microsoft to operationalize that and make that just a thing everyone has to do? Is it just culturally do it or is it like you must show me a prototype before you show me it.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:27:20):
Again, the future is here, unevenly distributed, even in Microsoft I would say, but there is certainly a strong cultural momentum and shift and desire to say, "Hey, let's actually look at live demos, live prototypes, and to even communicate the ideas. And to me, I mean, it's not always possible because obviously there are things that are deeply... If you're trying to change something in the bowels of Excel, you probably don't. There's even enough depth in the product that what you need to do, and you don't need to prototype that. But if you're especially thinking about new things and new products, new features, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:01):
Okay, let's talk about product management. There's this fear that emerged as soon as all these AI coding tools came out of just like PMs are dead, we don't need PMs. We could just build things ourselves. What are these people hanging around for? And what I found is it's actually the opposite that now that coding is easy. Now, the question is more and more, what should we be building? Why should we be building it? Is this right? Is this the right solution? Then getting adoption for it, which is what PMs are really good at. I feel like it's the opposite. PMs are the most important role. It'll change too, but let me get your take. Just what do you think the future of product management looks like? Do you think it's dead? Do you think it's going to thrive? Do you think it's going to change?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:28:41):
Yes. Look, if you are a TPS report, mostly process person, and a lot of companies do get confused about product management and process and project management, I think then you do have a question of, "Hey, what is the value add here," especially if AI can read and write 50,000 meeting notes and track things and send emails and so on, but what I do think on the flip side is the taste making and the editing function becomes really, really important. In a world where the supply of ideas, supply of prototypes becomes even more like an order of magnitude higher, you'd have to think about what is the editing function here.

(00:29:34):
So that does mean that the bar is higher for product folks, but I think there's an interesting side effect I am observing in startups that I'm advising, companies and even within the companies that there used to be more gatekeeping I would say, in terms of like, "Oh, we should ask the product leader what they think." And again, there is a role for that editing function, but you have to earn it now. You just don't get it because of this title, but there's also just unlock of latent really good ideas from smart engineers, smart user researchers, smart designers who now have this expert in their pocket to kind of round out all the other things that they're not typically skilled at to bring forward their ideas and that's amazing, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
And I think that expert, it's interesting, I'm working with an engineer on some stuff and he uses ChatGPT to even communicate to me in a more effective ways like, "Turn his pitch into something that will convince Lenny, this is a good idea."

Aparna Chennapragada (00:30:39):
By the way, that is actually one of my common use cases, which is the WWXD I call it. What would X do? I use it to say, "Hey, what would Satya think about this particular set of conversations or ideas that we are pitching and so on." This is the power of, I think deep reasoning plus relevant context, right? This engineer you're talking about has that context about you and so it's kind of very interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:06):
If only everyone was as famous as Satya and had so much information out there, but I guess you can import all their emails or whatever tools exist to just understand from the conversations you've had with that person.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:31:17):
Yeah. And I think this goes back to actually what you were saying too, which is I think this idea of what is the... There's like a coil spring. There's an intelligence overhang that I just see across the board. And I think the part of product development has to almost rewire ourselves to, I think, Tobi from Shopify calls it the reflexive AI usage. And that's not as easy, and I've been thinking about why. Basically, I mean, I have a cheesy Chrome extension. Literally whenever I open a new tab, it just says, "How can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?" It's very cheesy, but it kind of helps to pause and think, "Oh, what am I trying to do here?"

(00:31:56):
But the reason I find it hard, and when I talk even people who are living and breathing in this space, they find it hard is that the updating of the priors is really hard. The models couldn't do some things one year ago. I mean, image generation was full of spellings or reasoning. You just couldn't have deeper and smarter answers. You couldn't do data analysis. So my impression of it from change, trying it a few months ago, that prior needs to be updated. And it's hard to do that, right? You have to do something almost counterintuitive and against the grain to say, "No, no, ignore what you learned about what this can or cannot do." The baby just grew up to be a 15-year-old in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:40):
I think that last point is so important that we've tried these tools over the years. And so far, it hasn't been amazing and then all of a sudden it is, and you kind of don't know that and you've given up almost and things change.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:32:53):
I think that's actually... If you are a product builder listening to it, that's a really interesting arbitrage thing for you. If you can kind of cut against the grain and say, "No, I won't have that scar tissue around." This didn't work a few months ago and keep setting high expectations and demand more of the AI today, I think you can unlock more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
There's a lot of alpha in doing that.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:33:18):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda.

(00:33:54):
With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab. Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day and more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/Lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A .io/Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/Lenny. I'm going to come back to this cheesy plugin, say more about this. So this is a plugin that just lets you put a custom message on every new tab, and you have it say, how can you use AI to do this?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:34:45):
Yeah, it's as cheesy as that. And it's interesting because it works. In the last few weeks alone, I've been doing this experiment to say, "Hey, how much more AI pill can I get?" Both at work and in personal life to say, "When I'm trying to do anything manual, should I be demanding the AI to do this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:08):
That's so cool. Do you know the name of this Chrome extension by any chance otherwise?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:12):
No. No. I built it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):
You built a Chrome extension. That's so cool. Okay. Did you use AI to build it?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:20):
Of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
Wow. Which tool did you use to do that? Some kind of Microsoft tool I imagine.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:25):
Yes. No, actually, it was just like, I mean, I live in GitHub and GitHub Copilot, so I just was like, "Okay, let's go build this Chrome extension."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:33):
Are you releasing this for the general public?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:35:36):
No, I mean, that's the amazing thing. It took me like 10 minutes to do this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:43):
Okay, let's link to it. Let's get it out there, open source this thing. Okay. You mentioned Satya, I have a question about this. So you're one of the very few people that have worked very closely with both Satya and Sundar at Google. Let me ask you this. How do their leadership styles differ, and is there just a fun story you could share about each of them?

Aparna Chennapragada (00:36:02):
Yeah. I do feel lucky to have a window into these two amazing leaders of this generation. I would say, I mean, again, no surprise as you'd expect from CEOs of multi-trillion dollar market cap tech companies, they are 99.99 percentile in almost every dimension you'd think of intellect, empathy, leadership, product, strategy. There are, of course, flavors of differences. I was the technical advisor for Sundar for the first... At Google and set up the office of the CEO there. And they're, again, a matter of time and context because there's a lot more consumer-oriented focus there. So what I did find Sundar great at it is being really calm and measured and thoughtful in terms of making sure that things have... Dealing with the complex ecosystems.

(00:36:57):
If you think about the phone ecosystem or even the search and publisher and advertiser ecosystem, it's a very complex ecosystem. He was a master at that. He's a master at that. And I think on Satya, I find it amazing the appetite he has for learning and fine tuning his mental models and just the zoom levels that he can operate at. The macro, the strategy, what's the game? Also the micro, "Hey, why are we not..." Here's a specific insight that I saw on Twitter, and you can count on the fact that he's ahead of pretty much everybody else in terms of spotting those early things too. So it's just been learning from the firehose as they put it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
What a cool opportunity to work with two incredible folks. Okay, let's go in a whole different direction. Let me just ask you this question that I've been asking people more and more. What's the most counterintuitive lesson that you've learned about building products that goes against common startup wisdom, common product building wisdom.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:37:57):
I don't know if it's as common as it should be, and it's like a counterintuitive thing, but I've repeatedly learned that when you're doing something new, zero-to-one, the temptation is to kind of think about... It's like that South Park episode. Step one, think about the problem. Step two, question-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:57):
Underpants. I think it's Underpants, step one.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:38:19):
Underpants. Exactly, right? So I do feel like there's a temptation to rush and say to go to scale before solve. So I've always said to my teams solve before scale. So what that does mean is there's a different posture and different mode when you're trying to solve a problem versus scaling something that's either post-product market fit or even at least in roughly in the ballpark. So to give you a couple of examples, I think when you look at the solved stage, there are wide lurches. You got to be very comfortable with the fact that you're day one thinking about, "Hey, a plant detection tool." And then day 15, you're like, "Oh, actually, the tech is really good for translating foreign language." By the way, this is not hypothetical. This is what we kind of looked at in Google Lens back then and said, "Okay, what is the intersection and so on?"

(00:39:17):
So from the outside, it looks like chaos, but actually, in the... And you should be very comfortable... Not only tolerant, I think you should have an appetite for that because the last thing you want is prematurely fix on one local hill. And then you're climbing that in start-ups and entire product areas and companies, big companies make that mistake and three years later you're like, "Oh, how do I get off this hill?" So I'd say that's one big counterintuitive. When you're trying to think about what mode you're in, are you in the solved mode? Are you in the scale mode? One example is kind of making sure that you're comfortable with the chaos. I think the other lesson I've learned is the danger of metrics. And I think again, if you have worked on Google Search or if you worked on Office products, you really have a very fine-grained sense of what are the metrics for this product?

(00:40:11):
You have the input metrics out, you have the whole shebang, but when you're looking at something zero-to-one. If you decide on a metric two prematurely, that's false precision first of all, right? I mean, CTR. When you have a thousand people, it doesn't mean anything. Retention also may not mean anything. So really being very wary of this big guy, big girl of grownup metrics as I call it, right? You are looking for more qualitative, the sound of click, and what is your... The other kind of the handler uses, what is your set timer and play music? So if you look at Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant and all these things, they had a very promising broad interface. You could say anything, but I think there was one or two things that it was really good at. You could set a timer, you could play music, and you could play trivia. And so you've got to nail those things before you say, "Oh yeah, here you can do anything with it," which is not a good recipe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:11):
Not so funny. That's exactly what I use my Google Home for, so basic. I don't do the trivia thing now maybe I got to give this shot.

Aparna Chennapragada (00:41:20):
Got to try that. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
There's something along these lines that I've also seen you talk about, which is how to go zero-to-one with something, just a little framework for helping you know if this is the right time for this idea. How do you think about that?

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Speaker 1 (00:01:32):

Head to composer.trade and use the code Lenny for an extra week of free trial on your composer membership. That's composer.trade. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Head to composer.trade and use the code Lenny for an extra week of free trial on your composer membership. That's composer.trade. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

## Transcript

Archie Abrams (00:00:00):
When you have teams naturally break up the world into different funnel stages or different points in the journey, it gets very seductive to look at my part of the funnel and what's my conversion rate through that part of the funnel, right? And then the team starts to optimize for that conversion rate as their north star. But in practice, it's actually almost always easier to just make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate. Instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people, I just want more people to get activated.

(00:00:32):
And then once you start thinking that way, you realize actually the best way to get more people to get to a step is just get more people in the door in the first place. That will always hurt your conversion rate, but it may actually give you more people on the outside.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Today my guest is Archie Abrams. Archie is VP of product and head of growth at Shopify, where he leads an org of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data ops, and growth marketing. Shopify is both an incredibly unique and also an incredibly successful business, and they do things very differently. And as a result, there's a lot that we can learn from how they approach building product and driving growth.

(00:01:12):
Some examples include their priorities in product roadmap are driven by a 100-year vision that comes from Tobi, the CEO. And the core product teams don't have metrics or KPIs. They're essentially banned. And instead, decisions are made based on taste, and intuition, and building towards this long-term vision. Also, the growth team optimizes for churn, which is unlike any other company I've ever come across. And once you hear why, this will make a lot of sense.

(00:01:38):
Also, they keep long-term holdouts for every experiment they run, and they automatically look at the impact these experiments have had on the business a year later, two years later, and three years later, and then revisit these decisions down the road.

(00:01:52):
And in our conversation, we dig into all of this plus how Shopify organizes their growth team, how they run experiments, how the growth team collaborates with the product team, how they measure impact. Plus, Archie shares a bunch of very specific and interesting examples of changes that have driven growth for the business and so much more. This is such a fascinating conversation, and I know this will give you a lot to think about in terms of how you run and organize your own product and growth teams.

(00:02:34):
Archie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. 

Archie Abrams (00:02:38):
Thanks Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:38):
Excited to be here. Okay, so what I want to do with our time together is to basically do kind of a living archeology of how Shopify grows and what you specifically have learned about growing a company like Shopify into this just juggernaut of a business that it's turned into. To give people a little bit of a sense of just how large Shopify has gotten, so maybe surprising them about the scale of this company at this point. Could you share some stats about the scale of the business at this point?

Archie Abrams (00:03:09):
Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're about 10% of e-commerce in the United States. So basically if you're not buying an Amazon or Walmart, you're probably buying on a Shopify-powered store. And behind the scenes globally, we did about 235 billion in GMV in 2023, which is roughly the size of the economy of Finland. So we've got a big economy and big impact happening from Shopify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:37):
Wow. I think interestingly with Shopify, it's kind of this behind the scenes tool, and so I imagine many people have no idea they're using Shopify a lot of time when they're buying stuff online, and I think some of these numbers kind of creep up on people with just how large a company like Shopify has gotten.

Archie Abrams (00:03:53):
100%.

(00:06:18):
I want to start with something that I think is most unique from what I've heard, and I think there's going to be a lot of really unique approaches to how you all think about growth. One of the most interesting things I've heard is that how you think about churn and retention. To most companies, the most important thing is to increase retention, reduce churn. My sense or my understanding is you guys are kind of the opposite. You one, don't think tons about churn, you almost optimize for churn. Talk about that. How does that work?

Archie Abrams (00:06:48):
The way we think about churn is really going back to Shopify as a kind of our mission and what we want to do, which is to increase the amount of entrepreneurship on the internet. And so as a business, we want to make it as easy as possible to get started with your online store, with your business.

(00:07:06):
But most businesses do ultimately fail. And so the way we look at it is can we lower the barriers to getting started and get as many people in the door trying their hand at entrepreneurship? If we do that, again, many of those businesses, many of those folks will maybe on their first attempt not be as successful, but we're going to have a set of merchants who go on to become extremely big businesses, the Allbirds of the world, FIGS, etc.

(00:07:36):
And the way the Shopify business model works is we do charge a subscription, but most of our revenue comes from payments, which is tied to directly to a merchant's success. So in a given cohort of merchants, a lot of people will start. Some of those people on their first attempt that's entrepreneurship might not succeed, but the folks who do go on to be successful will make that entire cohort of merchants who started something that makes Shopify as a business extremely successful. And that's why we lower the barriers to get started and help folks grow, and those winners make the whole thing work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:12):
I love that. So what I'm hearing is it's not that you don't want people to stick around, it's not that you don't want people to succeed. It's that you're not optimizing every new shop for sticking around long-term. It's basically make it as easy as possible for people to try it. And all you need is a few big wins for it to all work out.

Archie Abrams (00:08:33):
Correct. And that's really a different insight than most SaaS companies that they get a customer, they really never want that person to leave. And we want to lower that barriers to get started and be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:44):
One of the main reasons companies focus so much on churn and retention is because it costs them a lot of money to drive new customers and users. I imagine there's almost an implied it's really cheap for you all to find new customers because of maybe the brand and word of mouth. Is that true?

Archie Abrams (00:08:59):
I think that definitely has some dynamics. I think the bigger factor is the monetization model. For most SaaS companies, they're making from a subscription, right? 29 bucks a month is the only way that they're going to really monetize. Whereas our business works, you have folks who are paying a subscription. But as folks get bigger, because we're monetizing on that GMV that that merchant is producing or the revenue the merchant is producing in the form of payments and other services, it allows us to grow with the merchant in those really successful merchants, make the whole system work well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:34):
Got it. So basically, your net dollar retention or network revenue retention is just absurd for the winners and it makes up for all the losers slash not losers, people that have tried to build an online-

Archie Abrams (00:09:44):
Yes, tried and haven't been very successful. When you can think of the other parallel is in angel investing, right? Most of angel investments are not going to work out, but the couple that do make that entire investment portfolio successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:00):
With retention not being the primary goal and the metric you guys focus on optimizing, how do you know if you're doing well? Is it some number of these winners have to come out every quarter, every year? How do you think about progress and achieving, and success basically for growth?

Archie Abrams (00:10:18):
This way is thinking about a cohort of users we acquire in a given time period, say a quarter. And then over the next year, two years, three years, four years, five years, how much GMV have those merchants produced in total? Not about per merchant basis, but in total, did that cohort generate GMV? And if they generate GMV, that will translate into revenue and gross profit and all of those things that we can then use to reinvest in growing the business. So it's really looking at the total value, but on that GMV basis. And GMV is a power law based metric. And so it's really that power law that drives the success of each cohort.

(00:10:56):
Again, going back to investing, same thing there. Each vintage from a fund, how much did that return as a fund? And it's really driven by the few really successful outliers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So this begs the question, that sounds like a very long feedback loop. And I don't know what I do with that information if five years from now, "Oh okay, that was a really good idea we did five years ago."

Archie Abrams (00:11:18):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
Comment on that. It touches on something you said about how metrics aren't actually a driver of how you all think at Shopify, so take that wherever you want to go.

Archie Abrams (00:11:26):
Yeah. So it's interesting. I think with Shopify, we very purposely set up different parts of the org to think on very different time horizons and with very different ways of thinking about how to build product and the like. Very different than a lot of companies that typically, have maybe one kind of unified, there's one north star that the entire company is rallying around. 

(00:11:49):
And so there's three major product groups at Shopify. There's core product which is basically building the 100 year, the right things for commerce 100 years from now. There's merchant services which is building things like payments, shipping, the tools that entrepreneurs need to be successful with a more shorter or medium term horizon. And then growth is really thinking about that end-to-end customer journey. How can we bring folks on and make sure they're successful?

(00:12:19):
And then from a metrics standpoint, we do have obviously some leading indicators in growth that we're looking at on a given experiment or what have you. But the key in what we try to instrument in our experimentation is the ability to really look at longterm effects of experiments.

(00:12:37):
So we constantly will relook at an experiment a year later, see that the way the GMV curve for the distribution was different than we might've originally thought. And that'll actually change what we do from that previous experiment. And so there's a lot of longterm monitoring of experiments over these very long time horizons to both inform what those input metrics are and more importantly hold ourselves accountable to, did we actually move what we cared about, which is that longterm GMV, in the right way?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):
Wow. Okay. I want to spend more time here. So the way you're describing it is the way the business operates is you think, what is our 100-year plan? How do we think, where does this need to be in 100 years? And with that, it allows you to run these long holdout experiments to see, is something we're doing impacting the business broadly? And because you think so longterm, you can take a year, or two, or three to see if there's an impact and then make adjustments versus I'm having to drive a certain metric every quarter, every year.

Archie Abrams (00:13:47):
Correct. And I mean on growth, we're definitely in the... We want to drive metrics on a short-term basis and we can do that obviously, but we have the luxury, and the way Tobi thinks about the world and the way we operate, to really think about these longterm effects and make sure that we're holding ourselves accountable with these longterm holdouts, and then constantly refining the input metrics that we're using and getting a lot smarter about that. But because we take that long horizon, it allows us to be better in the short term and just get a lot smarter.

(00:14:17):
And a lot of counterintuitive things. And I would encourage everyone, if you can, look at some of the experiments that you thought were your biggest winners. Look at the downstream metrics for a year, two years on that experiment. And I'll bet you'd be surprised how many times the metric is different than what you thought it would be after a year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:36):
Because where people just make a call at a certain point in time, here's the list in it, here's the list experience. I love this, because very few people have experiences running a longterm experiment, and so this is a really interesting insight that you're sharing that, I guess how often do you find this to be true in your long-term holdouts, where things end up being very different downstream?

Archie Abrams (00:14:59):
I think there's probably two things that have been very common. And I would say in quite a few cases, you get a lift on a metric up front, a more short-term metric. Number of people who become a paying shopper, number of people who make their first sale in Shopify. And then you look a year later, and there's actually no incremental lift on GMV from that cohort.

(00:15:21):
And so I think it actually trains, a lot of us in growth are looking at these short-term metrics. A lot of the time it's actually more pull-forward effect, than you fully realize or an incremental user that's just really not worth that much. So that's one.

(00:15:35):
And then two, so this effect size goes away. There are cases where the experiment has flipped the other way. And then there are cases, and these are the most interesting ones, where you realize that you uncovered a pocket of merchants that are actually extremely valuable entrepreneurs who go on to be successful, that you missed in your normal short-term measurement techniques. And so all across the board we see that. But actually the most common is it actually isn't a long-term lift from a lot of things that you might think of the short-term are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:16):
Is there an example in that second bucket of what you mean when you say there's a pocket of valuable merchants?

Archie Abrams (00:16:22):
Yeah, I think a lot of this has to do with, we call it monetary friction. So one of the hardest things to do with a business is when you're getting started, is you might not have any revenue coming in, and you are kind of bootstrapping, which in Shopify's case might be 39 bucks a month. But still, it's a real expense. 

(00:16:43):
And so typically when you can lower the barriers to monetary friction in some form, that could be all sorts of monetary friction early. The common belief is that we'll usually get lower quality folks coming in the door, because usually discounts are associated with lower quality. 

(00:17:03):
If you think about in a business case, if I give you a little monetary boost and reduce that monetary friction, I can actually causally change your ability to become successful, because I've given you a little bit more time to try that idea a little bit longer. I've given you that opportunity to move your business over to Shopify. And so often in those types of experiments you see that you've basically unlocked a class of people who might've given up without reducing that monetary friction

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):
Interesting. And giving them time to actually make it work.

Archie Abrams (00:17:39):
To make it work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):
Okay. So just roughly, do you have a sense of how often you find no effect after a year that you saw early impact? Just to ballpark that.

Archie Abrams (00:17:50):
Yeah, it's in the 30 to 40% range.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:51):
Okay. I think you're tearing the heart out of so many growth people right now, and nobody wants to hear this that works on growth where you're saying potentially a third of the experiments they're running today that are showing lift probably don't have that same... Don't have any impact down the road.

Archie Abrams (00:18:09):
Yes. Unfortunately, I think that's brutal. Probably more common than we like to believe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:15):
Yes, and nobody wants to hear this, except people that you should want to hear this because if you want to build a business that grows and need to grow, it's better to know to learn that now. 

Archie Abrams (00:18:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:29):
Okay. So for people that can't run whole long hold that experiments, I guess is there anything that you find is a good early indicator that might be the case? Most people don't have time to sit around and wait a year or two or three. They're not thinking 100 years.

Archie Abrams (00:18:43):
I mean I think end of the day that is going to be the most effective and you actually learn the most. I think it is, though even in shorter term horizons, really being as specific as you can be about what are the early signs of success in your product, and making sure you instrument those. And then making sure, particularly up funnel experiments, you are actually looking at the further downstream metrics to make sure you have some understanding of what's moving down. 

(00:19:17):
So as deep as you can go in the funnel for as long as you can wait. Do that. And if you can't, you know what I would say? Still you should just bet on, if something is showing lift up funnel, still ship it and it's probably not going to hurt you, but don't overestimate the amount of impact that this is having.

(00:19:34):
So it's funny, two things here is, my recommendation to folks is don't think, "Oh my goodness, I have to wait all this time." Because if you didn't move the short-term impact, you're not going to have the long-term lift. So still ship if it's short-term lift. Just be reasonable that if you can measure it longer term, you'll get better about identifying what things are that are really impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:57):
Got it. And so it may be positive initially, but often neutral. Rarely is it neutral initially and then positive down the road?

Archie Abrams (00:20:09):
There are some cases of that, but it's rarely... I've seen neutral be positive, but I haven't seen negative.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):
Got it. Okay-

Archie Abrams (00:20:16):
That resulted positive. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):
Got it. Okay. So that's reassuring. You're not harming the business, but you're probably getting a lot more credit than you deserve as a growth team shipping things that are-

Archie Abrams (00:20:27):
Likely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
Likely, right?

Archie Abrams (00:20:29):
Likely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:29):
And there's also just trade-offs to moving on and on balance, you're probably doing good things if you continue to ship things that are showing positive. Right?

Archie Abrams (00:20:39):
100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):
Okay. This is awesome. For people that want to run long-term holdout experiments, I imagine you've built your own experimentation system internally? Yeah, we have.

Archie Abrams (00:20:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:51):
And is it basically you hold out 10%, say it was some percentage of users from seeing the new change? Is that how you approach it or is there a different way of approach?

Archie Abrams (00:20:59):
Two things. We have two layers of holdouts. So one is more the holdouts of every change in a quarter, holdout 5% across the board. Second is for changes that only affect new merchants, what we'll do is we'll take that group of folks, let's call it 50/50 split, and then run that for a few weeks. And then what we're doing, we look at the long-term effects is actually ship the winner to 100%, but we're looking at the cohort of folks who was assigned to the experiment. We're going back and looking at those people who were assigned a year later.

(00:21:36):
So it allows us to still ship, get stuff out, but we've kind of held the experiment in a way that allows us to see those long-term effects just for the cohort that was exposed. That only works if you're doing it on new users. For existing, it's a little more complicated. That's okay. And then in our experimentation tools, all experimenters are paying that three months, six months, nine months, 12 months with here are the updated results. So you can't really get hide from, what did this really result in over a longer term horizon?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:10):
So your tool is email everyone that's involved with the experiment of here's what this cohort is doing now.

Archie Abrams (00:22:16):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:16):
I love that. Okay, that's awesome. It's interesting that you use kind of these cohort curves for GMV, and is that the core metric you look at to see?

Archie Abrams (00:22:25):
There's a few GMV, obviously gross profit. But GMV is kind of like a key determinant of long-term success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):
So it's interesting. Most people use cohort retention curves. You're using cohort because you don't look at retention. You're looking at for GMV over time. So that's really interesting. 

Archie Abrams (00:22:45):
GMV over time, which correlates better. And there's a retention in profit. And then really the absolute number of merchants who are on the platform and then reaching certain GMV.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:56):
Okay, I'm going to not keep falling this path. We can go on and on. While we're in the topic of experiments and what you've done, I'm curious if there's any examples of big wins that your team has shipped that might inspire people as they're thinking about launching experiments. I know there's probably some trade secret stuff you don't want competitors to know, and I know this is particular to Shopify and a platform in eCommerce. But I guess is there anything that would be worth sharing of like, "Here's a huge win that maybe we didn't expect."

Archie Abrams (00:23:25):
Going back, there's always a lot of value in thinking through monetary friction as I mentioned. That's always going to be something to export. Trial dynamics, different types of incentives, all of those things are very impactful.

(00:23:39):
I would say on things that are maybe more practical and for everyone, there's an enormous amount, and we do see these with long-term effects. But just the nuts and bolts of sign up, collecting the right information. And you usually want to collect more information than most people think you do in your sign up flow. If you can then leverage that to personalize the guidance. And this is for SaaS product, the guidance that someone can get when they onboard into Shopify. 

(00:24:09):
So whether you're coming on, Shopify is a very diverse product, in-person selling, online selling different channels. There's the nuts and bolts of get more information from folks, build trust in there, give them right amount of guidance when they come on in a personalized way.

(00:24:25):
And that may sound like, okay, that's kind of obvious. But the amount of impact by just nailing those flows has never ceased to amaze me and setting up that person for long-term success. So monetary friction. Then just really good onboarding, personalization, a well of opportunities there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:49):
I love that onboarding comes up every time I ask anyone where they've seen ongoing success and opportunities, particularly in actually surprisingly driving retention. It's interesting that that's not what you look at, but it turns out that's one of the biggest levers for increasing retention. Interesting that even for a company that doesn't look at retention, that's a big opportunity.

Archie Abrams (00:25:07):
Yes. Yeah, it's really because it's setting people up, for Shopify's case, I think the big thing about all of our metrics is... What we get very nervous about is the easiest way to increase retention is always to constrict the funnel stage one above the retention metric you're trying to optimize for. 

(00:25:27):
The simplest way to increase my signup to activated thing is just make it harder to sign up. Nuts and bolts, that will always happen is when you have teams on that local conversion rates, you get all these weird team incentives, because they're optimizing to basically implicitly make it harder to do the step before them.

(00:25:49):
And because we focus on that long-term GMV, number of merchants who are successful, orienting every team to think about the total number of people, not the rate, but the total number of people who got to the end of their part of the journey is a very powerful way to incentivize people to do the right thing in terms of getting people set up versus do the, "I'm going to constrict the funnel step right before me to make my local conversion rate look better," which is the bane of my existence but something I see a lot of teams, implicitly or explicitly do when they get too focused on rates as a way to think about the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:32):
Incentives. What a power.

Archie Abrams (00:26:34):
Incentives, what a power, what a lever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
I definitely want to chat a little bit more about metrics. I know you have a really interesting take that's kind of built on what you're just talking about. But first of all, you mentioned this term monetary friction as one of the levers that you've seen success with. Can you just describe what that actually means?

Archie Abrams (00:26:48):
Totally. So things like trial, trial dynamics, trial length, trial amount. It means incentives. So what is in your product? What do people value and need in order to be successful? So in Shopify's case, that might be app score credits or things like that, but those are the two forms of monetary friction we talk about and then of course actual price point. But that's what the larger bucket of monetary friction is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:16):
So let's follow this thread of metrics. You're big on absolute numbers and you've been talking about this already, versus percentages and ratios. Talk about that and how you encourage your teams to think about metrics.

Archie Abrams (00:27:29):
Yeah, I think one of the things that I think happens particularly in large, in Shopify's growth order, it's about 600 folks. When you have teams naturally break up the world into different funnel stages or different points in the journey, it gets very seductive to look at my part of the funnel, and what's my conversion rate through that part of the funnel? And then the team starts to optimize for that conversion rate as their north star over a longer time period. I'm going to try to move my conversion rate from 10 to 12% or what have you.

(00:28:04):
But in practice, I talked about it's actually almost always easier to just make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate. If I make it harder to sign up, it's going to be very easy to increase sign up to activated rate, because I just have fewer people and the people who made it through our higher intent.

(00:28:23):
And so I see teams get really stuck when they are trying to optimize conversion rate, but they just make it harder to do the previous thing. Versus everyone is thinking about absolute number of people who made it through their "stage" of the funnel. So instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people, a conversion rate, I just want more people to get activated.

(00:28:48):
And then once you start thinking that way, you realize actually the best way to get more people to get to a step sometimes, and often they just get more people in the door in the first place. So make it easier to sign up or reduce friction. It's the opposite. 

(00:29:05):
Because that will always hurt your conversion rate, but it may actually give you more people on the outside. And a lot of teams get very nervous, their retention rate went down, their LTV went down. Oh my goodness, is this this going to affect our ability to pay? No, your CAC also went down by probably more. And so now you have the ability to likely spend more and you have more people through the door, getting to each point in the activation or the immersion journeys.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
What I'm hearing is essentially teams are gold not on increase, lift this conversion step by some percentage. It's drive some absolute number of new merchants, potentially.

(03:22):
First up, we've got Eeke De Miliano. Eeke was head of product at Retool. She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.

Eeke De Miliano (03:36):
"To what do you attribute your success?" And you can't say "luck". Because I think humble people will always say "luck" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.

Lenny (03:58):
Next up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Geoff Charles (04:06):
I ask, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.

Lenny (04:31):
Next up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.

Shishir Mehrotra (04:56):
It's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14]." This question will actually work well for any role. But say, "You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?" That's the whole question.

(05:23):
Usually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, "Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?" All these different questions come out.

(05:39):
I'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, "Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?"

(05:59):
Interestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, "Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. "Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?"

(06:31):
The second one is, "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?"

(06:37):
And then he took those two questions, and he said, "Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants." You can say, "Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run." Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, "Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it."

(06:59):
On the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.

(07:12):
If it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, "Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?"

(07:32):
But these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.

(07:45):
That question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, "I guess I would ask them what size it is." I'm like, "Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.

(08:16):
But then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, "How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, "What is the question that really drives this answer?"

Lenny (08:45):
This next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.

Yuhki Yamashita (08:53):
"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(09:25):
Or sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, "Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on." The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, "Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.

Lenny (09:57):
Next you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.

Katie Dill (10:12):
"Tell me what work you are most proud of?" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Karri Saarinen (10:36):
I think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.

Camille Hearst (11:04):
I like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.

Lenny (11:29):
Next is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.

Jiaona Zhang (11:35):
I do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?

(11:44):
Ambiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward.

(12:05):
I think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (12:44):
Next up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.

Noah Weiss (12:49):
"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" When I say "unfair" or "secret", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. "What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.

Lenny (13:11):
This next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.

Ben Williams (13:22):
"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.

(13:49):
Also, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking "why" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.

(14:08):
And then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.

Lenny (14:42):
Next up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):
"What would your siblings say about you?" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, "What will your parents say about you?" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.

Lenny (15:00):
What do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):
I look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, "My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together," that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, "Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me," that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.

Lenny (15:30):
Next is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.

Paige Costello (15:36):
I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (16:15):
We are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (16:25):
"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you could do that for, "What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.

(16:53):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.

(17:19):
There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate." When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.

Lenny (17:52):
This next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.

Ayo Omojola (18:01):
"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or, "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?"

Lenny (18:21):
Next up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.

Scott Belsky (18:31):
I like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.

(18:49):
I also like the question, "Do you consider yourself lucky?" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.

Lenny (19:18):
Our penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.

Lauryn Isford (19:26):
"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (19:46):
Our final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.

Paul Adams (20:00):
I have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.

Lenny (20:23):
And it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable. Leave a comment either on the newsletter post, or in the YouTube comments, or even on Twitter. Let me know what you think. If there's a great response, we'll continue to do this. If not, we'll never do this again. All right, thank you. Enjoy.
