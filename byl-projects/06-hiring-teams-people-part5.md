# Tobi Lütke's leadership playbook: First principles, infinite games, and maximizing human potential

## Transcript

Tobi Lütke (00:00:00):
Your podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders, what is your energy source? My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. There are so many books are about this ... Technology leading to dystopia. Like no one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today. I think today is the dystopia of the future. It behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that leads in ... Towards progress.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
There's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. "If most people are doing it a certain way I by default don't want to do it that way."

Tobi Lütke (00:00:34):
There's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do, usually without an accent. They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the chart that is behind them. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with outperformance? Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive. The most powerful unquantifiable things in the word of business are fun and delight.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
I don't know of any other company that operates where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.

Tobi Lütke (00:01:11):
I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically, to make entrepreneurship more common.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Tobi Lütke (00:01:37):
I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. Reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:54):
Today my guest is Tobi Lütke. Toby is a man who needs no introduction so I'm going to keep this very short and get you right to this jam-packed conversation. If you enjoy this podcast don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that I bring you Tobi Lütke. This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts you need them to reach users reliably, that's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.

(00:02:42):
And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience. Plus, you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world. And they're helping Lenny's Podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

Welcome to the podcast.

Tobi Lütke (00:04:24):
I'm glad to be here. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):
I've listened to so many of your other interviews, I've talked to a bunch of people that work for you. I want to try to do something a little different. There's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as I've listened to you share advice, and interview, and in talking to people that work for you. One is thinking from first principles, the other is maximizing human potential. I'm just going to plant these seeds for now. I'm going to not ask about these directly, I'm going to come at these from the side with the many questions that I have for you. Something that I've heard people describe at Shopify called the Tobi tornado.

Tobi Lütke (00:05:01):
Oh, wow. Okay, that's a start. I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
What is the Tobi tornado?

Tobi Lütke (00:05:08):
A Tobi tornado, I would say, is a whole lot of change management or a conversation or conflict or real talk compressed into a very short timeframe. I see something it doesn't ... It's not good, I have a conversation. I have learned something very quickly about hey, I need to update my priors, or cool, let's do it differently. At which point a project might be stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of a product. And everyone who's currently on the team, of that particular project, is no longer on the project but they are the founders of the next version which is built differently. And that might be a bit whiplashy for people. I mean, I certainly hope that's true, it's certainly what people tell me. It's also what they appreciate about the company. It's like what is best ends up mattering a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:08):
Basically, it's you going into a chat room being like "Hey, this" ... "We're going to end this project we're" ... "Let's try something else" because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea. Some people complain about this practice of like "Oh, Tobi kills the we've been working on." My lens is, you realize we're just wasting time on this thing that is not going to work and we shouldn't do it. Is there anything there along those lines?

Tobi Lütke (00:06:32):
No. This is everything. Again, once I imagine something might be not the right thing to work on I'm either incorrect at which point this is super important that I understand why or I'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it. There's a third wave which is I could also ignore it but that's an abjection of my CEO and founder responsibility that I'm absolutely not willing to make so that's just not a path forward that I see valid. I understand that's what a lot of people choose to do. So yeah, compressing time is important. We have a fairly limited time in our careers, right? Our careers are not that long. If you're lucky you have 40 years in the industry. Most people spent more time in school and then maybe leave later if they're so lucky that they can. So it's not even that.

(00:07:33):
I think you want to do the maximum amount of things you can be proud of at the end of your career. When you look back you want to be saying, "Hey, holy shit, we shipped this thing which was absolutely an incredible contribution to a mission I cared about at a company that was full of other people who cared as much as I did." And also are very proud of working. And maybe even thinking of working with me and being really, really glad that we spent time on projects together. Yeah, none of this happens if everyone's sort of optimizing a thing that probably shouldn't be there, right? And, therefore, I think it's the better thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:16):
And, by the way, I love this way of describing ... Of compressing it in time to just make a decision, not focus on making it come across the most kind, nicest, sweetest way. When you give feedback to people when something is not the way that you think it could be or as good as you could be it's often very direct and often hard to hear. To me this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential, you're trying to push them to do something better. Is there anything there that you think is a way of approaching feedback?

Tobi Lütke (00:08:49):
I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. I just think everyone is way, way, way, way, way better than they think. And the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and, therefore, we could not take advantage of them. It's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things at which point you get stuck competing with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious.

(00:09:33):
I have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do. And I have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves. Now, in a way, this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed, right, in myself. By the way, I'm talking about myself here too. I think I have way more potential than what I bring to bear and I hate that so I'm trying to cultivate the skills that I need for tomorrow and constantly challenge myself. I'm harder on myself than on anyone else. By some discount rate act equally to the people around me, especially the ones who just so, obviously, are brilliant.

(00:10:23):
Spending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard means that they accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could. To me this is the most wonderful thing to see. And frankly this is a throughline for all of my career because this ... My product is that. I want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could. And, in fact, become more ambitious about what they are building with their online stores and their businesses than they are actually initially set out to do.

(00:10:56):
Because something like this happened to me, right? I started a snowboard store at some point. I didn't set out to build Shopify. If you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step, and optimize for maximum amount of learning when you choose these steps, it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential and progress. Maybe people are not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it. School teaches you that you have to learn this particular piece of math in this 12 month period, and it doesn't matter how much you understand it. It's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which has nothing to do with anything I've ever seen or learned or see ... Or witnessed about how to actually learn things. You follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth. In a way Shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction. I've just seen this to come to be true. And, of course, hearing from someone that you respect that "Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you and I expected" ... "I think the next time this happens in your career you should go path A because" ... "Based on your conviction." And, therefore, that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right? What I love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to the actual potential rather than sort of their current level plus or ... Plus some, I don't know, a little bit extra.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):
There's so many threads I want to follow here. The example of the school is such a pertinent one. To me right now we're looking at preschools for our son and I'm ... They're describing their education philosophy I'm like, I don't know why I should believe this is the right approach. And it makes me just want to spend all this time researching what education approach works. I know it's just preschool and maybe not as critical yet.

Tobi Lütke (00:13:38):
Did you have a bet yet? I have three kids too and this is sort of a decision that every parent faces, right? So many of your listeners are probably product managers of machine learning products that maybe this resonates. So there's a funny thing about machine learning which you're just like ... You train on a lot of data, and, hopefully, you get something that predicts the thing you want it to predict correctly out of it. The biggest problem of this is overfitting, right? What does good look like, a loss function? Which is a heuristic because it's not the actual task that the thing will do in the future it's something that proxies to the task that you want the thing to do in the future. Predict fraud, predict the next word, whatever. So overfitting is basically model learning how to cheat on the benchmark or on the fitness function.

(00:14:39):
So there's a business analogy of this which is that ... It's called Goodhart's law. It's literally the same thing as overfitting just for businesses. Goodhart's law just says, "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric." Same exact thing. The universal truths are things that almost any competitive field will invent for itself by different terminology often. And I think this is also, by the way, why it's so interesting to focus on personal growth and learning a lot about a lot because you end up finding these sort of hidden harmonies behind things, the things that are clearly enduring correct insights. So overfitting, Goodhart's law are the same thing. School optimizes for what? Marks supposedly, right? In fact, overfitting in school is literally the kids cheating to get marks, right? You get another analogy. What is however the right loss function for children? Have you made a decision yet?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):
No, I have not we just started down this path. You told me-

Tobi Lütke (00:15:55):
It's the kind of thing [inaudible 00:15:57]. You have to actually go fairly deep in philosophy to figure this out. And then again afterwards you can build, you can find the schools that you like. For us it was just maintaining curiosity. This is a completely different goal from being good at marks. But I just think everyone's born extremely curious and school has a habit of getting it out of kids. Literally, there's a foundation model of a child, and you fine-tune it at school, and it just loses the neurons of curiosity because it's actually discouraged to meander into other topics and explore them just because they're interesting. I don't know. This is sort of not the beat of a podcast but I just think about this a lot. It's funny how these things just recur constantly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):
So when Archie was on the podcast, he's the head of growth at Shopify ... I don't know if that's his official role. Basically drives a lot of the growth. He talked about how the core product team, outside of the growth team, operates without KPIs, without specific goals. And decisions are driven by taste and intuition primarily you, and Glen, and some other leaders. And a lot of people heard that and they're like "I" ... "First, I don't believe that. Second of all, how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly what is right and good?" So the question I have is just how does one operate in that way successfully? What does it take for a company to work that way because a lot of people will try it and fail?

Tobi Lütke (00:17:25):
This is very close to what I just talked about before with [inaudible 00:17:28]. Goodhart's law is real. The moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer a useful metric, right? I think that's more or less a precise wording. Why? Because no metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business because business are complex. There's a million of different tensions in a company and you can't all keep them in harmony by optimizing for one fix. It's true that we don't have KPIs and we don't have at least OKRs in the Silicon Valley sense but we are extremely data-informed. We have invested enormous amounts of money and time into systems that give us basically everything at our fingertips. I sent this demo to other founders and they're completely bowled over by the way we can dig into basically every constituent atomic bit part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago by the end of a ... At the end of a quarter or month or week.

(00:18:39):
In a lot of different places, this is one of them but also in its products, it's just not overfitting for the quantifiable. Everyone competes for everything but it's highly quantifiable because it's ... It's fun, it's like a game. You tweak a number and 0.1 more is better than 0.1 less. That's an immediate gratification thing. But I just think the overlap of most valuable things you can do with a product, and for things that happen to be fully quantifiable, it's like maybe 20% which leaves 80% of a value space unaddressable by the people who will only look at quantifiable things. Shopify is comfortable with the unquantifiable things such as tastes, quality, passion, love, hate. It's with the strong emotions that people have.

(00:19:49):
The sort of deep satisfaction that a craftsperson feels when they've done a job well is actually better proxy if you allow it to be then the ... Do a unit test pass. A unit tests might not pass. And the unit tests will pass 15 minutes later because we already fix them or adjust the one or two things so they support us. We have systems that tell us exactly if something goes the wrong way. There's an extremely sophisticated rollout system in Shopify that forever holdouts and correlates everything with everything for ... In every experiment and so on and so on and so on. But if you think about it as a cockpit for a pilot. The decisions are still made by pilots and we think this leads to better results. It's just the same with our product. There's plenty of A/B testing tools and all these things for commerce, and it's, of course, really important to figure out what your conversion rates are. But are you representing your brand is an unquantifiable question? Are you proud of the thing that you have built? Do you feel it's your own, right?

(00:21:03):
And so I think there needs to be more acceptance in businesses or for unquantifiable things. The most powerful, not unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight. If people have fun when they're doing something that is just upstream from so ... Sorry, downstream from so many other things. I think that if all the metrics are pointing down but everyone says, "My God, I'm having so much more fun," I think that the very next thing that will happen with some time delay is all metrics will start going up. And if that doesn't happen then we adjust course.

(00:21:51):
The reason why we specifically don't have OKRs and these things is because ... If you want to hold the unquantifiable as things that are stable and exist ... That people actually do really defer to them and really actually learn to be okay with someone just saying, "Hey, this is actually just really great and they're shipping this" then you need to make certain edits to a business that don't remind everyone too much of the companies they might have come from which the only way to get promoted is by driving the metric up. It's a bit of a [inaudible 00:22:24] conversation I suppose. Good on the fortune cookies saying, "Shopify doesn't do OKRs or doesn't do metrics" and so on. But it's actually just because the metrics take us [inaudible 00:22:37] function where we often defer to just more ... Sometimes a little bit emotional but generally less quantifiable things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):
I imagine if someone were to hear you describe this of focus on joy, and fun, and love, and delight, maybe ... It's easy to dismiss that.

Tobi Lütke (00:22:58):
It sounds completely idiotic, right? Again, there's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do usually without an accent, have a full head of hair. They talk about metrics, they are in front of PowerPoint presentations, they usually have a stick and show dramatically at the pie chart that is behind them. And highly charismatic, highly ... So that's our aesthetic. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with our performance? I don't know but some of them ... Some people pull it off who are like this. I think the world is sort of stacked to lead us astray based on our stories about what optimal looks like are just so incorrect in so many ways. Optimism always sounds dumb, or at least naive. Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Metrics driven sounds extremely sophisticated. Talking about fun sounds like naive.

(00:24:14):
Well, first of all, I've always ignored what people think generally. That came pretty natively to me somehow which I'm very lucky about. But I've now actually learned that almost all of the alpha in the world is now in the ... Exactly the things that are unobvious but true. And the things that people dismiss as naive or so. The most successful business person on planet Earth is Elon and he conforms to no idea of what the most sophisticated business person ought to be like in any which way you can imagine. I think we live in a world where the counterfactuals are winning because our ... Because aesthetics are just leading us astray.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
This is an awesome segue to the other theme that I wanted to spend some time on which is thinking from first principles, Elon is the classic example of that. Honestly, I think you're the other most classic example of that these days. And we'll keep talking about all the ways you operate very differently from other companies which are examples of this. But I want to read a quote from Glen Coates, he shared with me, of how he sees you that gives an interesting lens into your first principles thinking. So here's what he said about you. "Tobi is at his heart a true futurist, he's obsessed with the way things should be in the future. Being data-driven is innately being anchored in the way users and technology are behaving today. He's never really said this to me explicitly, but knowing him I think any design that is drawn primarily from the way things are or were is one that he sees as inferior to one that is skating to the puck of the way things could or should be." Does that resonate?

Tobi Lütke (00:25:55):
Yeah. I mean, I think that's correct. That's actually really interesting. Your podcast is a podcast by a-

Tobi Lütke (00:26:01):
Your podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders is like, "What is your energy source? Where are you getting energy from?" I think fundamentally the world exists at room temperature. Almost all companies are running at that, humming along, doesn't do anything. There are certain individuals who can inject heat into businesses. Founders do this very well. All the startups anyone's ever heard of have people who are injecting heat because if no one would inject heat into the business, at room temperature, you cannot outperform anyone else. You can't be hotter than everyone else if no one's injecting heat into the concern. So fundamentally, there is a injection of energy into companies that comes from founders and the best leaders, like all the people you've had on the podcast from Shopify have a perfect set of cast of characters of people who are just exothermic. They are just like wellsprings of energy that leads to all the amazing results that we get to enjoy.

(00:27:21):
So the question is where does energy comes from? And that's another one of our discussions which very quickly goes into the emotions. Actually, there's a really... So I watched The Last Dance, the Netflix special of Michael Jordan a while ago, of course, but there was one scene where he just, I'm sure this is a super famous story and he just made up an insight that someone told him so that he would then go and just want to destroy them afterwards, which he then of course proceeded to do because it's hard to imagine anyone more exothermic than him. So we know what his energy source is. It's rivalry. It's potentially it's insight or it's anger, something like this.

(00:28:06):
I am not... My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. My fundamental belief is all this talk about technology where all... So many books are about just technology leading to dystopia. You know what dystopia is? Today, compared to what it will be in 20 years ago or any. And you can play this for any part of human history. I'm not making a future statement. I'm making a almost totalical statement about the experience on planet Earth. No one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today rather than today. And so I think today is the dystopia of future, and I think it behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that lead in towards progress in a small way or a big way. But yes, I think if someone comes to me and says, "Hey, let's go do this thing. And we've looked around and here's how people solve this problem, let's make a good version of that," I'm like, "That was not the job." Because everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true.

(00:29:38):
The entire field of... What was it? I forgot the name of a field. Chomsky's field, the linguistic research field. It's cool. We now have autoregressive models that are just like, we don't actually need to set up a complete... We don't need to research the structure of grammar to be able to make machines also engage in the spoken word. We actually can just train on the internet, it turns out. So that was not possible back then because you didn't have the right architecture for this, but now it is. So I think what you have to do is to actually have, when you come up with a new product or you discuss a new product, you have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, "How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?"

(00:30:25):
For that, to do that, you actually have to understand the power and the composability of all the building blocks that exist right now, which is a tall order and no one is perfect at this. But so this way, you go ahead and say, "Okay, cool, so this is how we are implementing this thing. This is how it will be implemented today." And now we can talk ourselves in taking shortcuts. "Maybe we should actually start up doing it the way everyone else does. Maybe we derived exactly what everyone else does as the correct thing to do."

(00:30:56):
Sometimes there was a lot more wisdom encoded in the status quo than you expect, which is I think is super delightful. Then you figure that out and so when you act on it. But what isn't okay is skipping the exercise and doing the same thing everyone else does because that is again a abdication of product leadership. And so yeah, I would say I become extremely suspicious if I get a pitch to do a good version of the same thing everyone else does because I just find that in our space specifically very rarely to be the best solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:33):
There's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. "If most people are doing it a certain way, I, by default, don't want to do it that way. And if you want to do something world-class, you can't do it like everyone else."

Tobi Lütke (00:31:46):
Yeah. I don't even think that's an opinion that I hold. I think that's actually... We are basically in axiom territory here. If you want to do something better than what exists, you have to do it differently. That does not make a statement about if it will be better in the end after you do it. It could also be worse. But you can't get something better done if you do the same thing. It's like axiomatically not possible to do. It's fails Archimedean logic, yet it's something... You would be amazed how many business plans are actually failing Archimedean logic in this way like, "Let's do a good version of this thing that we've already been doing and we will capture 1% of the market," and just like this stuff. It's like, "Trust me." I find it kind of cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):
Is there an example that you can share of you approaching the problem this way? I imagine it's constantly happening. You also mentioned you're born this way. So I think it's hard for someone to just sit down, learn, think the way Tobi thinks, but I'd love to help people start to approach problems this way, so maybe an example might help.

Tobi Lütke (00:32:54):
I think this is entirely learnable, I think. And so I encourage people to just have a practice of think step by step essentially and just do it. It'll become a habit pretty quickly because it just, it also just outperforms.

(00:33:09):
Examples. The very first example is Shopify itself. It's cool. So there was lots of e-commerce software and it was all the way it was because of path dependence because everyone who want it in 2004, 2005, e-commerce was an existing retailer and therefore they had complex businesses that needed to be ported online, including all of their somewhat Byzantine business logic. "I wanted to make e-commerce software that would do very well on the internet of the future and I believe that we can make it easier to start new businesses online than it is in a physical world because the physical world is encumbered by a lot of regulations and also upfront costs for leases and so on. So let's optimize for that case and build something that is so intuitive to use that frustrated people in dead-end careers can spend their lunch breaks making progress towards building their own business, which then eventually allows them to do it on their own way."

(00:34:25):
And so being fortune was biased, eventually it turns out to be a much better prep for also solving all the enterprise cases because no one had to... Enterprise software is overfit to the sales process, which is that it wins the RFPs because it has every feature ever or at least a way of putting a checkbox next to every RFP line ever. But they're not good, right? An RFP is a great example of overfitting in the world of procurement because it tells you nothing about the quality of software behind it. But honestly, this happens all the time. It is just like here, we are setting the stage for much more, much higher quality retrieval for the products on Shopify and across Shopify. I think we've been in a local maxima on search and we think that, especially with the advances of the new models, certain things are now possible to do that could not have been done yet because again of these layers and layers of path dependence and no one coming and saying, "Is that the best way to do and maybe we should rebuild this component periodically?" We can now do a better job if search that will leads to much more delightful experiences. And so this is a fun project that this happening right now in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):
I think this is really interesting because what I'm looking for is like the Tobi algorithm of first principles thinking. Elon's got these famous ways of thinking he shared. One is start with the cost of metal to help you understand how much a rocket should cost. And then he's got this five-step. First, decide, do we need this thing? Then figure out how to optimize it, then automate it. What I'm hearing so far, and I'm curious if you've thought about this? And if not, this feels like a really good blog post in your futures, the Tobi first principles algorithm, but I'll share a couple of things I've heard so far as you've described it.

(00:36:24):
One is analyze the path that existing solution has relied on, almost like the assumptions that were true for it to be built back and it was built. And the other is this overfit, what is it overfit for? What is it over solving that maybe isn't necessary? Is there anything along those lines of just how you approach problems?

Tobi Lütke (00:36:43):
This is probably too nerdy technical. You are right, but I should figure myself out a little bit. My brain runs on a meter language but isn't directly something I can translate into words, I suppose. I think more about things like this in terms of programming constructs, pure functions, overstate. And I think in any moment, the best decision to do is I think the perfect product lead is almost like a thermostat for high quality product. It's like you're setting, saying, "I would like to build something really, really great and I'm going to go through a series which is much, much more complex than what a thermostat does," which basically checks the temperature and then makes a decision of air con or heating. You make you re-derive literally every decision that is valuable, every foundational assumption, every foundational ABC direction. And you want to see the observation you've made in the meantime since you last derived the next step. Re-running the entire function over the state that is now updated, the higher fidelity information, would you come to the very same thing?

(00:38:08):
Sometimes fairly early in the construct in the tree of foundational assumptions, change is made. An example we all had was beginning of COVID when we suddenly had shelter in place. So Shopify has that incredibly good office spaces and we were very in-person company and we've... Our floor plans because I think we really added something to the understanding of how to put great... I got a lot of founder energy from my co-founder, Daniel, to build great collaborative spaces for creative work with lots of happy accidents, people running into each other and so on.

(00:38:46):
Anyway, we were very, very, very, very determined on doing that. But somewhere in this construct of nesting functions, you have to rerun and foundational assumptions. It's in the stack is the fairly basic Boolean of are people allowed to leave a house? Which was yes. The moment that flips, it's not that just like, "Okay, over here let's do the best what we can do." It's actually that the entire tree now moves into a different place. And it can be a very far place, different, that you land because you will make the same quality of decision on every step, but you need to rerun something that takes you to a completely different landing zone. And so then this is also easy for us to say, "Cool, we are going to be remote only forever? Let's go." And because we realized that the temporal shelter in place would cause a series of events that would make that for optimal best set of trade-offs for the company. And so I think this is... Can I put this into a piffy five-step? I wouldn't know, but maybe it resonates with someone who can help me figure out the coded English language for this because it has been nerdy way the I explained it, even to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
This remote work example is something I definitely wanted to touch on, which is I'm glad you got there. So in this decision, is there anything more you could share about how you got to that place of like, "Oh this Boolean changed so we should rethink this?" Because I know you probably, you weren't... I don't know. Were you in the shower and just like, "Oh wow, we should really go remote because of this"? How did that actually come about? And then I wanted to ask on another part-

Tobi Lütke (00:40:27):
Yeah, pretty much actually yes because again, I rerun over all the inputs and figure out what happens. And here's a couple of other things that were starting to fray on the decision to be in person as well. We started in Ottawa, Canada, which is a city of a million people, and it has some tech heritage and good universities. But at a million people, it's just not population dense enough and has a depth of talent pool that it can support a company that is going to 10,000 people. So anyone who runs this optimization function I'm talking about here about location strategy for a new startup will come to the conclusion if they do it right that everyone should be sitting around the same table. Only if you can't do that, do you say, "Okay, let's be all in the same couple of rooms." Only if that doesn't work anymore, you say, "Okay, let's be spread over one floor." If that doesn't work, in the same building. If that doesn't work, in the same city. If that doesn't work, at least stay in the same time zones or make sure that there's good hub connections between.

(00:41:39):
This is how it works. It's just like some assumption somewhere along the line is invalidated. You end up in a different side of a decision tree. But what was happening to us was we already were in four or five cities. We were adhering to the same time zone at this point. But my experience was I went through, sometimes at the Ottawa office, through an entire day where I had 10 hours of meetings, which is fairly normal, but I do every single... I don't think I had a single other person sometimes with me because every one of them was with people in another office. Some people are dialing in remote and so on. So there was an awkward hybrid-ness which we ended up in making only good decisions along the way.

(00:42:29):
This is actually the most dangerous thing. Most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree, in a local maxima of a path-dependent environment, by only making good choices. People think that making a good choice inoculates you from making mistakes or that the presence of a downside of an idea ends up disqualifying the idea. Both of those things are incorrect. So what you need to do then is... So that was an overlay to decision.

(00:42:59):
The moment COVID started, then we also had this thing of shoppers exploding because we were actually an asset to people during COVID, e-commerce for the local businesses. And we took that very, very seriously trying to make more businesses survive COVID, small businesses survive this particular calamity than otherwise won't which is important because small businesses tend to be wiped out first anytime the times turn fragile. And so we needed to staff up. And so there's a very weird question about where to staff up. So clearly the better input there would be if you could hire people everywhere. And so once that decision flipped, you can see how this is actually now super easy to say, "We are going to remote," because there is no turning back. There is no... Even with this decision, it's a better set of trade-offs for the future is to accept the vast additional difficulty of building a remote company. It's way harder.

(00:44:03):
It's not something you should recommend to anyone to do this because it's the same as trying to run a world record marathon run in Aspen, Colorado. It's like there's not enough oxygen up there to do that. But if you end up pulling it off, you're a real Chad. That's very cool. So I find difficulty itself interesting. And again, I spent enough of my teenage years on the internet to know that there's amazing cultures that can be put together purely remote like, I don't know, Wikipedia, World of Warcraft, Raiding Guilds can at least have excellent cultures. And so we are like, "Okay, cool. Let's come to a new stable part." That stable part was don't port the office online. Let's port the internet into a company and then we are like, "Let's go."

I want to talk about this talent stack concept that you've touched on a couple of times that I think so much. But before we get there, I want to go in a different direction, which I think is an interesting foundational element to your ability to be successful in your first principles thinking, which is you getting to the metal, to the core of the problems you're solving by actually spending a lot of time coding. And I actually heard a story about how you all had this huge all-hands summit. You flew everyone in. You're all together. There was a three-day hackathon. And the way it was described is you're sitting at a table with headphones in, coding, just like any IC engineer. No one would've known you're the CEO of this company, the founder of this company. Why is coding and working in the code to you still so important?

Tobi Lütke (00:46:46):
It's so funny that that's the way the story goes. It's right, but I don't know why that is surprising. That's my happy place, being able to clear out free days of my calendar and being there till midnight with all these remarkable people who join us on journey, just building stuff. It's like, I do my job so that that is the jobs that exist for other people. That's a job I actually want. That's the one I couldn't find because no one did a company for me. But at least back in most days, I think still not really.

(00:47:26):
And so I just love coding. It's one of the greatest, I don't know, hobbies and pursuits. I've done it for a very long time. I came across it very, very early. It fits my brain like a glove. I appreciate so much of the craft behind coding. I am a trained apprentice in... Sorry, I've apprenticed as a programmer in Germany, which has a dual education system that you can do such things. So I've been professionally in companies spending all day. And I really mean it, programming ever since I just turned 16. I think first day was just before I turned 16 when I started my apprenticeship.

(00:48:18):
And so I love it. I have a view on my screen left of you is a cursor right now, which is opened to a Juniper notebook where I'm working on some projection stuff that I'm playing with. I try to sanity-check as much as I can of what I get. I try to find... It's a game for me to find new insights in data. And I just think, I don't know, it was cool. Maybe this is the picture you talk about. There is a picture that someone captured, which is really fun where I'm on my laptop with a bunch of engineers and then Harley, so president, is on stage DJing. This was taken at 1:00 AM or something like this. It's a picture which actually really precious to two of us because it perfectly summarizes our relationship in a way which these happy accidents are wonderful and these long journeys, I've been doing Shopify for 20 years now, so I appreciate these artifacts. But yeah, so...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):
To be clear, the reason this is unusual is, and why someone told me this story, is most CEOs do not do this, don't just sit there and code along with the team. And the reason I thought this story was important is and the reason I think your first principle approach works is you're actually in the engineering details, similar to Elon if you think about it, of just in the weeds doing the thing, understanding how the thing works, not just coming up with ideas out of pontifications. And so I guess is there anything there of just how important it is, if you want to approach thinking from first principles, it is to be really close to the metal, to the bare metal?

Tobi Lütke (00:50:11):
Well, yeah. First principles thinking starts from, I think Elon puts it as physics, which I think is a little bit atoms-coded. I think just from the atomic building blocks really is a right starting point. Atomic building blocks are the computers we are using. Computers are our instruments. We use them to create the music that when people appreciate to receive in the form of software. So you've got to understand how they work, at least to work the way I do.

(00:50:48):
Now, is the way I work optimal? Of course not. This is my point about the aesthetics of how to behave, how to work. I probably don't conform to the traditional view of what the most of public companies should be like or even should spend their time, but I think I'm successful because I don't try to conform to anything other than what I've learned works. And so what I learned works is be in as many details as you can. Really, really, really just understand the stuff that we are making decisions about and be willing to don't put too much stake into the sunk cost fallacy. Try to inoculate business or your parts of a company from a sunk cost fallacy as much as possible because that allows you to just see better solutions and so on.

(00:51:45):
And I think what we were doing, if I remember right, is at hack dates is we were working through pros or cons of just merging all of Shopify into one huge monorepo and we are sketching out directory structures and tooling that we would need, and...

Tobi Lütke (00:52:00):
... tooling that we would need and... Again, monorepo, now for companies, it's a very much one of those door A, door B kind of things. It's a very consequential choice that is incorrect to go say yes to at a certain size, and then it becomes very correct in my mind to say yes to, but at that point it's an enormous amount of effort. So, it's a kind of thing that actually is something I'm uniquely positioned to be involved with because it's actually a business strategy thing as well. That's an investment, a very real investment to say, "Hey, let's change the way we are building system. Let's figure out what the best way is."

(00:52:47):
There's going to be change management. There's going to be some people that have very strong opinions on yes or no. And frankly, "Tobi said so.", helps. It also compresses a lot of time, because everyone knows the way I book. Everyone can come to me with better ideas about anything, and if you're right, I will change my mind. But I will hold my opinions very strongly until the point of being convinced that they're not the correct ideas. Maybe that's another aspect of this Tobi Tornado thing you talked about earlier, people do fight.

(00:53:27):
Again, the aesthetics of our times put a lot of stake into consistency. I remember various politicians losing campaigns because they were called flip-floppers at times, which I... Although, I'm more of a Maynard Keynes school of... "When the facts change, I change my opinion. What do you do, sir?" It sounds like a better OS to go by.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:52):
It's awesome, because I'm extracting more of your algorithm of how you think about stuff. A few things you just shared are, ( 1.), you need to be in the details. This is thinking about to be successful as a first principles thinker is (B.), you need to be in the details in your case code. In Elon's case, it's like, build the thing and be at the factory, sleeping on the floor. As you said, he's very Adams based. You're more digitally native. And then also, don't be so reliant on some costs. Like you said in this Tobi Tornado case, "I know you've been working on this project, we're going to kill it, because it's not going to work better if we do that now versus this. Just keep going, because we've been going." And then, coming back to the stuff you've shared previously is, analyze the path that you've been on, that the previous products and solutions have assumed the path dependence of them, and then don't look at what they've overfit potentially, that isn't correct. Love it. Okay. This actually is a good segue to something else that someone that you work with suggested I ask you, Farhan, your head of engineering. I asked him, "What's the best way to get a glimpse into Tobi's mind?" And it's actually along the lines of what you just described, which is, the question is just, what's the best way to disagree with you?

Tobi Lütke (00:55:02):
I think just disagree with me. I immediately love it, honestly. I really crave it. It's very funny. I know how this really surprises people. And I actually appreciate it even more because it requires courage, and frankly, I actually do find that... But it also makes me immediately trust the person more, partly because I, first of all, think they will do what they think is right rather than what is convenient. Agreeing with a group tends to be much more convenient. But more than that actually, that they're courageous enough to do it right then. I think courage is really, really rare. I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage. I found a lot more maybe even genius than courage. I like that. I wish it wouldn't require that. This is why I try to be very inviting of it.

(00:56:08):
When someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop and say, "Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement." And it's almost never, I find, in the, "I just feel like we should do this differently." What I'm looking for is offer unstated foundational assumptions. What is our divergence point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are, when it gets to this point, I found. Sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is incorrect. People tell me and then I'm so glad we talked about it, because I will stop forever nagging on this thing because now I know we can't do it because of Sarbanes-Oxley or something like this. It's just like, "Well, cool." My mental model of Sarbanes-Oxley, which is regulation for public companies, is not perfect. I have not in-depth studied all the details for it, so I will not consult this in my mind when I am saying, hey, we should solve the task at hand in a certain way. So, this is very good.

(00:57:24):
How to disagree? I really like debate. I will play devil's advocate actively if everyone agrees on something. Again, especially if a proposal is something that feels like I could have predicted would be a proposal before it got into the meeting and there was nothing surprising in it, I will make myself an end boss of a level and just say, "I'm going to say this is just not that good. I think we could do way better." I want people to then argue more in-depth for the veracity of the decisions, and that leads to a form of disagreement. I think all these things end up building trust.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):
I like that that touches also on this idea of, again, maximizing potential, the potential of the teams, the potential of the employees

Tobi Lütke (00:58:14):
Because of course, the really important decisions, we don't talk about. This is the most important thing. Shopify probably makes... What?... millions of decisions every day, like, write this code this way, yes, I'm going to add this unit test, maybe I'm skipping a unit test. Might be the difference between a future production audit. Millions and millions of these tiny decisions. So, you're not hiring engineers primarily or accountants, you're hiring people who make excellent decisions, given their specialization and areas they're overseeing. And given that, decision making as a concept is actually really understudied, I find.

(00:58:59):
I think these are instances where we can just learn to make decision making together. Because I think while a lot of decisions are made independently, we are a product company, we are on a mission, and we want our product to feel like something that a single person made, in the same way how any author tries to write a book that clearly reads that it came from one mind. Because people can see and spot this, if this doesn't happen. You end up with something that looks like a television remote, where there's a Netflix button over here... It's like you can reverse [inaudible 00:59:41] from the remote control. That's important.

(00:59:48):
Using these moments and also bringing decision making inwards to go and say, hey, let's have very efficient opportunities for as many people that can possibly get together, make decisions together, not as a democracy but with clear who needs to convince who. That because otherwise this ends up just taking way too long. Give a opportunity for everyone to change my mind over Glenn's mind, and so on, is an excellent practice, I find. I think this is a more optimal way of going about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):
Speaking of disagreeing, it reminded me of a story I heard, about the Tobi Tornado actually, the way you operate that. I love it. It ends up being this interesting microcosm of your first principle's way of thinking. The story is, I think you've said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to say something they disagree with on the internet.

Tobi Lütke (01:00:42):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):
That's often the way you approach this is, you post in a Slack group, "Hey, I don't think this product is going to work, and here's why." And that ends up creating the most information for you. Is there anything along those lines that might be helpful to share?

Tobi Lütke (01:00:56):
I don't think that's one of my better ways of doing that. I have to be somewhat careful. The people I worked with a lot, I will do this, just because it's funny. But even I can see that that would seriously stress out the interns.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
You guys have a lot of interns. I think you have 1,000 interns this coming year, is what Farhan shared.

Tobi Lütke (01:01:20):
Yeah, we just started. I was in the office yesterday and it's absolutely full of interns. It's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Oh, man. Love interns, so much energy. This idea that you shared about building one product, building towards one vision, this actually reminds me of something that came up basically every time I had someone from Shopify on, which is this idea of a 100-year vision that you keep. I don't know of any other company that operates in this way, where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.

(01:01:48):
Can you just speak to that, of that way of operating, why you find that helpful, how that actually works?

Tobi Lütke (01:01:54):
I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot. What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this, or 10 or 5 years ago? What's the decision our future selves would want us to make, is useful. I find future casting to be generally extremely valuable. I definitely did not build Shopify to flip. I had lots of opportunities to sell Shopify to various people. I didn't consider it, because it's just too interesting of a journey and I think that's too... If a endpoint [inaudible 01:02:34] all companies is a convergence on a set of four or five people who can afford them, that just creates too much of a monoculture, I think, in thinking.

(01:02:43):
I like that Shopify is different. I think this is good. I think it's a terrible place to work for many, many, many people. It's the best place in the world to work for some people. That's so good. That's what we want, I think. We want more of this. We want people to be able to window-shop for a place where they can be enormously successful, because the place's set of beliefs just fits you like a glove.

(01:03:14):
100 years. We have very long-term plans. 100 years, you can't talk about this software product, but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically you make entrepreneurship more common. That is the thing we wanted to cause in the world. We have had, I think, success doing this already, but again, there's no speed limit and no stopping point for this. As I keep saying, the word's unbelievably path dependent. And therefore, if we are part of a path, we can cause it to be more in adherence to the things that we value and would like to see. This is the wonderful thing about company building. They can have lasting impact.

(01:04:16):
We are making decisions based on all the things that we can do. What are the things that will be most long-term valuable for the long-term pursuits we are on, and how can we normalize entrepreneurship? It's a thing that's really important to me, just because people don't spend enough time on it. It's all economics. Our [inaudible 01:04:44] living entirely depends on businesses. We are all part and tag of an environment that is extremely entrepreneurial and actually celebrates entrepreneurship as a courageous act and a glorious act even.

(01:05:02):
But that's not true in most of the world. In fact, most people never encounter anyone who engages in doing that. It's not something people see as one of their options. I want us to make these choices. And I think the long-term focus matters. It's also really powerful for decision making. And I know this is potentially intuitive to most, but also rarely practiced. You've had a lot of people from Stripe on here. Stripe and Shopify have had a very long-term partnership. Stripe and Shopify had potentially the most valuable partnership, or at least one of the top ones in history, of technology, because we were both very small companies and we decided, hey, let's work on an assumption that both of us are going to win our markets, and work together. So, Stripe's [inaudible 01:06:02] for payments and we're allowed a part of Stripe and so on.

(01:06:07):
When you're in a partnership like this, you play basically iterated prisoner's dilemma. Every instance, every turn you can make a choice: coordinate or defect, defecting if the other person collaborates, collaborator effect. If both collaborate, everyone gets a point. If one defects and the other one collaborates, you get a lot of points, all at one moment. Being a good partner in business is like this corporate marshmallow test that companies tend to fail in a very funny way.

(01:06:44):
If you see the videos of kids doing actual actual marshmallow tests, the smart ones actually turn the chair around, look away from the marshmallow, and sit on their hands, and just go vibrating. Because they know it's the right thing to wait for getting two marshmallows in the future, but man, if they just look at a marshmallow, they'll just eat it. Most CEOs, most companies can't even successfully do that and just engage in pulling future profits forward at a discount or even defecting on partnerships that would be much more long-term valuable.

(01:07:16):
If you're talking about long timeframes, like 100 years, there is no question. But clearly, the correct way to play iterated prisoner's dilemma is coordinate for both sides. It's way more valuable [inaudible 01:07:27] doing that over long periods of time than any momentary defection could possibly be convenient at a moment. It's a huge amount of product decisions. When we are deciding roadmap, end up being very influenced by this, because I get pitches for things we should do and why don't we do this kind of change to the system, there's so much money in it, and all these kind of things. I'm like, cool, but almost always come in a form of putting future profits forward at a discount.

(01:08:08):
But we have a long time horizon. Let's not take the discount, let's... Also, you often compromise the entire business after a while because you end up just... Your customers notice if you're going into value extraction. The best companies, I believe, at least from a perspective of a leader, resemble some kind of cockpit, or maybe a room full of dials or levers for monetization. My job is adding as many of these levers as possible to the room, and then not pulling any of them. Because I think we do best if we are on the same side of a table of our customers and we had them become entrepreneurs, which is a mission, and we want to support them to be more successful, which is the business model we are in. We get a very, very small stake of the sales in our monetization system. And therefore, we are incentivized to make everyone as successful as possible.

(01:09:11):
Again, when I get a PowerPoint from investment bankers or so, where they tell me I have enormous pricing power and I could massively change the prices, I'm like, "Yeah, but I'd leave Shopify if that happens to me, so how is that good?" He's just like, "Why?" It just goes like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:30):
There's a quote that you wrote somewhere that, to me, identifies this point so succinctly, "On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack." Yeah, beautiful.

Tobi Lütke (01:09:46):
I think that's pretty piffy and it's also just... Try to argue with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):
That's true.

Tobi Lütke (01:09:54):
Positive-sum games have incredible returns, especially in the worlds of software, where you can experience exponentials very easily. I see company building as... I wish there would be better analogy than chess, because chess is a game of perfect information, which is totally incorrect. But one thing which I like about chess as an analogy for business is that it basically is two games, that you have to be good at at both. There's a positional game that you learn: Develop your pieces, gain influence by your pieces over the board. That's really, really important. And then there's tactics, which you learn tactic training. You go get a puzzle trainer and you drill tactics and you learn the intuition to sports tactics, sense them. Both of them are actually super independent of each other.

(01:10:53):
The business world only talks about tactics. It only talks about the conversion of we did this thing. We did an A/B test and we changed the color of blue, and conversion red went up. We lionize the easy hack. I don't think that's important, honestly. You need to be good enough at tactics to not go out of business. You can't get margin code, sure. But the sum total of all the value of a potential tactics that you could employ stays with you if you are actually are doing the positional game.

(01:11:36):
The positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? Do they rely on you? Are you part of a team, or are you used as a tool in the toolbox, usually forgotten, sometimes coming out when certain task is being done? What does your product cover? What industries are you addressing? And so on, so on, so on. This is the positional game. How well do pieces fit together? Do people like relying even deeper on you?

(01:12:25):
If you do that well, the tactics are yours and you can hire a lot of people who are extraordinarily good at spotting tactics and using them. But if you do it too much, you end up extracting through tactics the entirety of the value that you have created and that is yours to take through a positional game. And if you do that, you have nothing left in the tank. That's for companies that we all see, that just got to a point and then just fade. Those are the companies that got tacticked out of their position.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):
The skill, obviously, is finding the balance between these two things of short-term, not get margin calls, as you described, but also think ahead.

(01:13:09):
Is there any kind of heuristic for founders listening to this who are like, "How do I do this? How much should I be thinking about the future versus now?", I guess? How do you try to create this pie chart of driving goals immediately and show investors we're killing it, while also thinking ahead?

Tobi Lütke (01:13:22):
Is there a good heuristic? Objective number one is: Don't die. Again, in the end, for companies that become historic companies are the ones which did not die. It also sounds very basic, but actually it's more actionable than it might seem. Past that point, I would argue: Just focus on the positional game. I think this is where a bit of a discrepancy of the founder and the rest of the company sometimes lies. I think the founders create finite, winnable games for people, that are very much serving the infinite game of developing, that the mission implies, the quality of position on the board.

(01:14:14):
By the way, it's an infinite board. Just picture the chess board as the initial terrain, but there's, I don't know, fog on the board and it's a terrain that's much larger that you will explore over time. I think that's the most prettiest way of mentally thinking about the experience of building a company. It's an exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission. And you will get to explore how correct your mission is and how good your decision making is along the way. And you get to learn a lot, and this is why I think it's a valuable thing to do.

(01:14:55):
But they often, the founders, and the mission of a company are in alignment, but they are, again, non-quantifiable things. They are pursuits. Maybe as time horizons that go past, all of our time horizons of our careers, therefore that makes it hard for people to care deeply yet. But they do care about the instances, the games along the way, the [inaudible 01:15:24] that have to be done to explore a part of a map, the tactics that have to be executed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:29):
I'm not going to take us here, but I know you're a big fan of this book, Finite and Infinite Games. I actually had it once at a book club and it blew my mind open. I'm going to link to it. People should check it out. You've talked about this on another podcast. I'm not going to [inaudible 01:15:40].

Tobi Lütke (01:15:40):
Yeah, it's a lovely book. James Carse did an incredible, underappreciated... I think they essentially wrote one of the best business books. They is trying to write a hard philosophy book. I don't know if it works for its intended purpose, but I think there's more value in what he actually accomplished. Maybe, sadly, it may be that he didn't know before he died, which would be very sad.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):
It's a little hard to read for people...

Tobi Lütke (01:16:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):
... so just stick with it and just try to wrap your head around what he's trying to say, is my advice.

Tobi Lütke (01:16:14):
I think reading... I don't know how many it is, but... the first couple of chapters really helps you get your arms around the story, his insight. The rest of the book are examples of his ideas applied. My takeaway from reading his examples is that he did not fully appreciate the insight of his own idea. It just ends up being very locally limited and very narrow-focused. It's a much grander idea than I think he really... This is why I say I don't think he fully appreciated quality of his own idea, which...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):
I think we need a Tobi version of this book, with a foreword, and...

Tobi Lütke (01:17:02):
I heard Simon Sinek...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):
Uh-huh.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:04):
... wrote a book of a similar title. I've actually never gotten around to read it, but I think he would be very good at interpreting this if that's what he did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
That's what it sounds like. I feel like his book is that book, written in a different way.

(01:17:15):
I want to come back to something you talked about, which is focusing on entrepreneurship and the merchants that you all work with. To me, this is another example of maximizing human potential. The way I think about this, people always talk about Y Combinator and Stanford and all these places that create all these companies and founders. If you think about it, Shopify does this orders of magnitude beyond, and I don't think you guys get enough credit for that, the amount of businesses you create, the amount of lives you change.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:43):
That's because we don't want the credit. That's the point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):
Is there a platform?

Tobi Lütke (01:17:47):
We don't want the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:47):
No.

Tobi Lütke (01:17:48):
I mean, maybe if you wanted it, you could also not get it, but we don't need to explore that because we actually, literally don't want the credit. Shopify is a company that pushes from behind. We don't want to be written into the story. We want to just...

Tobi Lütke (01:18:00):
... want to be written into the story, we want to just kind of have you do your thing. There's just too much grandeur in wanting to front it all. This is also what caused us to go and help people build their own things rather than start with a marketplace that everyone gets to lease a little component of at prices that corresponds to magically exactly your margin, as this usually goes in marketplaces. And so yeah, I think we don't want it. I'm proud of it, but that's intrinsic. I don't need very extrinsic appreciation for it, I suppose. There's millions, millions and millions of people that use Shopify daily and that represents the business and it causes major amount of employment around the world actually, definitely in North America specifically and Europe. And so I think that's really gratifying. I'm sure there's a way of saying that many of us businesses might actually have existed without Shopify.

(01:19:18):
I also think you can make a case that a good number exists because of Shopify, because what we've observed is that this was actually, it's my favorite thing in the entire Shopify journey that we sort of rigorously determined, which is that because I really, really, really prioritize good UX, legible interfaces. You can tame enormous complexity with great UX in a way that makes sense to people. I think this is actually almost a moral obligation to do for software because when software goes bad, it makes people feel dumb and machines do not get to negatively influence people in my mind. That is the inversion of the priority of the hierarchy of how machines are tools wielded by people to be more powerful at the things that they're already great at than they might imagine. That's when this all needs to fit together, but beyond the moral point, which is 10 years, and you could definitely take the other side of what we have determined is that every single time we make a complex thing simpler. It is actually that more businesses will exist on a platform.

(01:20:38):
So I think this is intuitive or at least directional, but sometimes people are not like, "Well, don't you just need to have all these features?" This is the RFP view of a world of software, right? "Don't you need to just have all the features then people can implement their plan?" Well, no. Think about the mental state and entrepreneurship entrepreneurs, they are, I mean especially if you're first entrepreneurs, they're unsophisticated. They don't know what to do. They're kind of scared. By the way, engaging in building something again is an act of pure courage and usually one which is very hard to hide from others. The people around you will know that you're doing this thing. Ask any entrepreneur. The amount of people who tell you to not do this is actually stunning. People do not want people to just step out of a box that exists that they sort of explain to themselves around them and have a chance of reaching higher because that would sort of invalidate their own life story in some meaningful way.

(01:21:38):
So there's actually a whole lot of nay saying that discourages people already, which is not super helpful. So now you have a situation where people are telling you to quit potentially, you don't have a lot of money presumably, you're asking yourself, are you even doing the right thing? Hopefully there's some elements of encouragement. Hopefully there's a passion. Hopefully you're trying to create a thing. Then comes to a situation that stuns you in some way, somewhere where suddenly the software starts talking about APIs where this is something you've never encountered in your life before or that just the option that you think it should have on the text configuration screen doesn't make sense given what we know about local taxes and so on. Here's the thing that happens. So the beautiful thing with Shopify is there's basically no tax configuration screen. It's just correct. The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity.

(01:22:53):
We know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks. On the wrong day, what that means, it's like they are going to close a browser and they say, "You know what? Fuck it. I'm not cut out for this." Or, "This piece of software I use sucks and it's too dumb for understanding the thing I have in my head," or something else. Everyone has a different rendering of the same thing, but just like progress stops. It is not just the businesses that shouldn't exist anyway that stop in this way. In fact, it's actually, and this is again what the data says, so many businesses get very close to this point many, many times. I can tell you Shopify did many times and I have more tools on entrepreneurial journey than most. I'm a computer programmer and I love those things. You tell me I can spend 14 hours programming for the next couple of years. I'm like, "Holy shit, let's go."

(01:24:01):
Most people aren't like that. So I've had unfair advantages that allowed me to overcome very technical climbs on this learning curve, but I know that's like most people can't have these advantages and therefore will churn out of a test. And so in other words, lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship. That is the best thing, the best answer to the most important question of my life that I've encountered because up to this point it was an intuition that doing the Shopify thing would be valuable in absolute sense, in a hundred-year sense. Afterwards I knew, right? And so that also just means now seeing things that are overly complex or shouldn't even be there, it's just physically painful because I know, it's like all these business that are trying to get somewhere and could exist and could now employ people and delight customers just died along the way because of something we did wrong or poorly and so on. And so this is a great source of energy for me to keep going.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:26):
I feel that, I feel that pain of the idea of anytime a button's broken or it's not as... the button's wrong color and more people would be converting means that you're not creating as many businesses, many entrepreneurs. The feeling you described of being scared to launch something, I exactly felt that when I started the newsletter. And my solution to that as I launched it is, "I'm just launching this as an experiment. We'll see where it goes, just don't worry about it. I might blog once in a while." And that really helped just lowering the stakes and I could see how just things like that and advice that can help someone get over that hump.

Tobi Lütke (01:26:01):
Yes, and I think this is an under explored thing in the word of UX. Random example, I was absolutely delighted by, maybe TikTok has the same thing, I don't know, but I was posting a video to Instagram and it allowed me to run a try run of the reel. It just seems like a new feature and just saying it shows it to a couple hundred people out of network and if they like it then it's going to post to my profile. I'm like, "I don't need that." But I thought that was one of the more... I honestly just closed Instagram and was like, "Holy shit, this is probably one of the most profound insightful pieces of software I've encountered. And as a connoisseur of good ideas, I've never had this as a valuable thing." It feels like a step function upgrade to the traditional A-B test as a concept because it's so understandable and I'm like, "What else in the world should have try runs that run out of network?" Basically everything, isn't it?

(01:27:03):
This is an amazing thing. Like I said, the rarest thing in the world, it's not even creativity or genius, it's courage. So let's lower the net amount of courage needed. Honestly, that's one of those things you can probably run an entire career or reinvent an industry on. These things unfurl into incredible amounts of value if you really pursue them and come at them from first principles rather than how can I do the things I want to do anyway slightly better because of insight. That's good and people should always do it, but not usually where most of the value ends up becoming, like manifests when a new idea comes around. So I talk radically about an Instagram feature. That's a weird thing to do, but I was actually just really to delighted because again, it just came up a few days ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:54):
I love this thread of courage. The example you gave reminds me also of I feel like going on a dating app at a different city for the first time is another example of this where it's a dry run, nobody knows you.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:06):
But even then, shouldn't there be like, "Hey, post my profile to a different city for telling me if it's any good."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):
SO people like it.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:14):
I mean I've never dated basically so I mean at least not in the last 25 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
Yeah, of the podcast.

Tobi Lütke (01:28:20):
So I'm pre swipe left and right dating, so my conception is very low of this. Maybe I should look more at dating apps. I'm pretty sure there's some amazing UX in most things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):
I imagine. I feel like dating is going offline more and more. I'm feeling like that's what people are trying to do. They're tired of the swipe, but anyway, going to go in that direction. Maybe a couple more questions while I have you here. One is this idea of the talent stack. You've mentioned this concept before and this is the term that I've seen you describe it as of this idea of the power of focusing on your unique talents and curiosity and that leading you to the biggest opportunities, especially early in your career. Can you just talk about what your insight there.

Tobi Lütke (01:29:04):
Yeah, again, I only lived one life, so I can't Monte Carlo all the decisions I make and just figure out which ones ended up being load baring, right? I'm at this point pretty amused by the following thing which keeps happening. But I am getting curious about some absolutely random thing and it really is fairly far-flung stuff and like magic it becomes the way that ends up allowing me to make a very important choice a year later. It's ends up being a better analogy that I've learned or a different way to see something or another idea that I found being represented in this area of expertise that is actually just again, another repackaging of another foundational idea, which allows me to go and look for more examples.

(01:29:57):
And it's just funny this way. So even early in career just I followed my curiosity. I love programming and I love computers and I loved the internet when it came along and I just like, "Cool, I'm going to find a task that I find valuable," which I was always engaged in retail and I have a lot to say about how retail should be brought by the internet to people. But this is a beautiful intersection of all the things that I find interesting. And then on top of it, I found Ruby, which I loved as a technology and then just now I was highly motivated to tinker, explore a space that was clearly emerging but just felt very obviously of value in the future.

(01:30:44):
But I didn't do it because I was following money. I did it because I like learning by doing stuff and I like tinkering the things and so this was a way of financing my tinkering by selling snowboards and then it led to other things. And I've kind of been doing that thing all along. It's great fun, great fun for me. I don't know how much of a advice that is, but maybe a proof point that can work really well. I sometimes worry though that things like this end up being a little bit like all you need to do is buy a lottery ticket, set for lottery ticket winner, right? So it's, who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):
It does resonate. It reminds me of something Brian Armstrong once shared, which is the reason that he-

Tobi Lütke (01:31:37):
He's also, by the way, you have to add him to the set of first principle thinkers if you're starting to cultivate one. And I think there's plenty of startup success, successful founders, CEOs, especially for public companies are surprisingly alike in this projecting slightly different, maybe coming from different backgrounds, but Brian is extraordinarily strong at this [inaudible 01:32:06] by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):
Okay, here's to the next nominated for the podcast, Brian. We'll get on it. But interestingly, he had basically exact same advice for what allowed him to create Coinbase is his background was economics, coding and cryptography or something along those lines. And it's the Venn diagram, is like, "This is the thing I'm uniquely strong at and have an opportunity to win it."

Tobi Lütke (01:32:29):
Yeah. So this is what we very actively tell our customers, right? There's a 2005 essay by Kevin Kelly saying, "In the future on the internet you just need a thousand true fans." It's what the internet and I think what Shopify celebrates, that instead of trying to create toothpaste, which is of course a huge term but hard to differentiate. It's much better to figure out a triplicate intersection of three different things and nail it. We took a winter vacation with my boys and my family in the Caribbean and I like playing poker with them. I like playing poker and it's great limited information game. I think this were valuable for kids and so I found this, I might have mentioned this in some place, but I found this pirate gold I think it's called.

(01:33:32):
It's just amazing poker set, poker chips that look like they come right out of the treasure chest or in Pirates of the Caribbean. Think about just the intersection, so this is online Texas Hold'em, quality poker set instead of... because you can play with just anything, right? People were in the market for spending money on something like this and pirate themed. You're like, " But I'm such a big fan, I'm telling you about it and people might actually purchase it because I'm enthusiastic about it." And because enthusiasm is actually the best marketing and they have at least a thousand true fans, and it's just better to make amazing things for some people than make something that everyone wants maybe or would tolerate. And I think that's really, really good. So I think that works for your career too because by the way, we are all entrepreneurs so we're ready to think about any career.

(01:34:36):
If you actually ask me for career advice is we are products, we are engaged in entrepreneurship, we are basically software as a service if you want, or talent as a service. We are selling a subscription in the form of our employment we call it, but it's actually just rebranded the subscription frankly because it comes some extra protection, which is very good, but it's still the same thing, it's a double opt-in company. Like you would say, I can do these things and I will be of significantly more value to the company than you will have to spend on me. There's like a positive ROI ideally for a company and a company either says, "I agree or I don't agree with you." And that's actually what employment is. So I think people should think about themselves as a product. Your career is not based on mentors you find or getting a promotion or not.

(01:35:34):
It's about what are you too good to ignore in? How good can you be? Can you be absolutely work? Can you be excellent? I mean you don't have to be work class and stuff, but you have to... Ideally you find a thing where you are just in this sort of tiny space of five intersections or so versus we just know more than everyone else and then everyone calls you. Like I said, we use Ruby. Ruby was not that fast. Shopify would rather have it very fast. We found people who got PhDs in dynamic language, garbage collection dynamic language, just in time compilation to make Ruby fast. And they're having delightful time at Shopify and Shopify is now very fast and it's very good. And everyone gets to profit from us needing this because we merged it back into Ruby Core and now everyone can have a JIT compiler. So it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):
I feel like every story is a fractal into other hours of other podcast conversation we can have. I know you have to go run this nine, 10, 10,000 person company and do real work. So I'm going to end it there. We got through almost everything I was hoping to get through, but there's infinitely more questions I still have. Just to maybe end it, is there anything you want to leave listeners with? Any last nugget that maybe you didn't mention?

Tobi Lütke (01:37:03):
If I get to talk to again people who look at product and product management, here's my thing that I think maybe only implicitly came through in all this. Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product. And it is not possible to make great products if the people work on it do not give a shit about the product. And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that the team gives a shit. And I think this is something that can be done with building empathy for people using it, but also it can be done infectiously by the product leader. The product leader has to give a shit. Do not engage in product work on product that you don't care about because you cannot produce the thing that the person will give you a task is looking for.

(01:38:04):
And I think again, so much goes into this unquantifiable conversation which we already had, but boy is that important because it just isn't about the brief document, it isn't about the aligning stakeholders. Sometimes in some places some of those things are aspects of it and I think they correlate sometimes with people. But I think the higher order bit is if you are in product, you have basically free roads. You have to have the team sits, look around corners that they don't see. You just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else because that's a role. Now, you don't have to do this by yourself. Everyone on the team is of a resource to you and you can query them and therefore determine what is around the corners and so on. But in engineering and UX and so on, but that's very important. Second is you've got to be exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing because just that one thing alone will make a 10 times better product. It's crazy how much of a change this makes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):
I feel like honestly what you're describing here is like founder mode, what the outputs are. Giving a shit, being exothermic excited and looking around corners. I feel like this is its own conversation here.

Tobi Lütke (01:39:37):
Yeah, I agree. I don't think founder mode, so I mean I think, yeah, founder mode is a super valuable term, but I actually do think that I answered the question about what I think about founder mode in the discussion about pumping heat into systems. That's what I do. It's just that founder mode in a founder run company, I think this has an easier time existing because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing. People fight them, people probably take them out, and if the boss is like this, boss can protect the other people like this. And therefore I think founder run companies can be innovative longer because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing for a long time. So anyway, that's my tear down on the founder mode discussion, which I think is a really fascinating recent discussion. I find it's very valuable. I'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways, but I think it's more actionable than people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:40):
Tobi, I appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets, even though I know you have to go, by the way, your video looks incredible right now. This is amazing editing, we're doing like a rainbow streaming across your body.

Tobi Lütke (01:40:53):
Yeah, we really hit the rainbows here like, "Let's go and invent." I hope you've got to gold that you were hoping and-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):
So much gold.

Tobi Lütke (01:41:00):
... I was sufficient leprechaun here to deliver.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:05):
What a metaphor. Okay, Tobi, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I feel like this is going to help so many people build great companies and thank you from first principles.

Tobi Lütke (01:41:13):
Okay, I got to run. Bye-bye.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):
Okay, bye.

# Billion dollar failures, and billion dollar success | Tom Conrad (Quibi, Pandora, Pets.com, Zero)

## Transcript

Tom Conrad (00:00:00):
There's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. I think, in some ways, our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. There's an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere. That would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has a mathematical formula that's going to win on any metric. Whatever metric you care about. You want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Speaker 1 (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Tom Conrad. Tom was an engineer at Apple, CTO of Pandora, which he helped take from zero to 80 million users. He's also VP of product at Snap, where he was the right-hand man to Evan Spiegel for two years. He's been on the Board of Sonos for over seven years. He was also part of two infamous product failures, Quibi, where he was chief product officer, which raised over $2 billion and died less than a year after launch.

(00:01:17):
He was also a senior engineering leader at Pets.com, which famously went from nothing to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months. Today, Tom is the CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is on a mission to extend the lifespan and the health span of the human race. In our conversation, we dig into what Tom's learned from these famous product failures, also, what he's learned from the many product successes. Tom also shares what he's learned about how to pick where to go work and what to avoid. How important understanding the math formula of the business model is. Also, lessons on burnout and health and leadership and contrarian corner. With that, I bring you Tom Conrad, after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:01):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates.

(00:02:25):
Within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKI process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Tom, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tom Conrad (00:04:44):
Thank you. It's so fun that I get to be a part of this.

Lenny (00:04:46):
I thought it'd be fun to start with a story about your time at Apple and you building this now very ubiquitous feature of dragging and dropping something into a folder. Which I saw you tweet about or talk about at a talk and the fact that it's still around. Can you just share that story and maybe a lesson from that experience that you've taken away?

Tom Conrad (00:05:05):
Sure. Let's see. I was 15 years old when the Macintosh came out. I remember really clearly my entire teenage years. All I wanted to do was to move from Columbus, Ohio to Cupertino and work for Apple. My heroes were that team of people that had written their signatures on the inside of the Macintosh. We cracked open the first Macintosh case. You would find the signatures of the 20 people or so who worked on the Mac. That was my only ambition, truly.

(00:05:40):
This was a period where no one wanted to work for Apple. That wasn't a thing. It seems like maybe a little obvious today, but it wasn't an obvious ambition at all back then. Anyway, I went to college. It's all I wanted to do. Studied computer engineering at University of Michigan, and as we talk about my career, it is just over and over and over. I'm going to say an incredibly lucky thing happened. The first incredibly lucky thing that happened for me in my career probably was that University of Michigan happened to be a place that Apple recruited from.

(00:06:08):
I didn't know that when I chose the school, but it made it reasonably easy to connect to a hiring manager at Apple. I wrote an actual letter and put it in an actual envelope and put it in the mail and got an internship and drove out in my dad's Pontiac from the Midwest to California. Spent a summer interning and my last day of the internship, I was thinking about really what I wanted to do when I came back. Hopefully came back to Apple after I graduated.

(00:06:39):
I had worked on a product that became shipped. It was called the QuickDraw GX. It was earlier second generation rendering system for the Mac. I'd been that team's intern for the summer. But what I really wanted to do is I wanted to work on the Finder. This is the only thing in the whole world I really wanted to do. I went and found Ron Lichty, who is the manager of the Finder team and said, "I graduate in 10 months. I'd love to be a part of your team."

(00:07:06):
I think he was like, why are you coming and talking to me now? You're literally going back to Michigan tomorrow. I go back to Michigan in May, the phone rings and Ron says, "The college recruiting department just told me that I have a college hiring rep and if I don't use it by tomorrow, I lose it." He's like, "I can't even interview you, you can't meet the team, but you're basically a freebie for me. Do you want this job?"

(00:07:38):
Just insanely lucky moment, got this job. I get to Apple in the summer of 1992 and I have a laundry list of things that I would like to do to make the Finder more usable. I remember sitting in Ron's office and saying, "At the grocery store, when you're carrying bags of groceries out, the door's automatically open for you? I think the Finder should do the same thing. When you're dragging an icon around and you want to put it in a folder, you should be able to hover maybe over the folder icons and drill down into the file system to get to where you're going.

(00:08:20):
Then when you drop the file, all of the folders that opened up between you and your source and your destination would close for you." Ron thought that was a fine idea, so that was the way Apple worked in those days. I just went off and started coding that up. I got to the point late one night, two in the morning at Apple, no one else was there, where I needed some kind of animation to indicate that the folder was about to open.

(00:08:48):
I'm certainly not an animator and I certainly wasn't going to do anything thoughtful in the middle of the night. I just wrote some code that blinked the folder, like selected unselected, selected unselected five times and thought, oh, I'll email one of the really talented visual designers to do something much more interesting. Long story short, apple finally shipped that feature four years later. Sat in the source code repository forever while we did other things.

(00:09:21):
When it shipped four years later, it blinked five times. Roll the clock forward six or seven years, Mac plus 10 comes out, entirely new Finder rewritten from scratch. No spring-loaded folders anywhere to be seen. People complained about it. It got re-implemented. All of the code, brand new. Folder blinks five times when you hover over it. Roll the clock forward another decade, IOS comes along and they added folders. When you drag an icon around, it blinks a few times.

(00:09:51):
I'm not sure what the point of this story is other than maybe it's something about, I think we all do this as designers and product people. We take these shortcuts that we think that we'll go back later and clean up. Sometimes, it's literally been 30 years that little design detail lingers three implementations later and now it's just a part of the way that these Apple products work. Pretty bizarre.

Lenny (00:10:16):
As you were talking, I'm on a Mac right now recording this and I just did it just to make sure it's still there and it is indeed still there. I think it blinks three times and then just opens up for you.

Tom Conrad (00:10:25):
There you go.

Lenny (00:10:26):
Full engineers got royalties on features they build that continue to live on in our product.

Tom Conrad (00:10:30):
Okay, I'll tell you just one other little thing to center you in time about what the Finder was like in 1992. We didn't get royalties, but our names were in the About box. You would go to About the Finder and the seven of us, there were seven engineers at Apple that worked on The Finder. Our names would scroll by the Finder, copyright 1992, yada, yada, yada, one name after another. Totally different era.

Lenny (00:10:55):
It feels like you got what you wanted with the name scribbled on the motherboard.

Tom Conrad (00:10:59):
For sure. I've gotten a lot of the things I wanted as a kid.

Lenny (00:11:05):
Along the same lines, I want to talk a bit about picking where to go work. Clearly you had a sense you wanted to go work at Apple. Over your career, you've landed at a lot of really successful places. You've also landed at a lot of very famous failures that we're going to talk about. What advice would you give people for helping them pick where to go work based on your experience?

Tom Conrad (00:11:25):
When I was a kid, my ambition to work at Apple was entirely about the product, so probably that version of me would say, find a product that you're passionate about and go spend your time and energy on that thing. Pretty quickly you learn that an awful lot of your development and day-to-day satisfaction really comes from the people that you get to collaborate with. Can you learn from them? Do you like them? Do they challenge you in the right ways?

(00:11:53):
Do they give you latitude in the right ways? It's so much about not just what, but who. For a very long time, my advice would've been entirely in the category of life, find something that you love with people that you think are amazing and the rest will take care of itself. Interestingly, I have been lucky enough to have some things that were successful on the metrics, get talked about the most, big audiences, big financial return, et cetera, et cetera. I've also worked on some things that were really notable disasters. When I look back on my career and think about the things that I've done, my professional satisfaction is not well correlated with those external metrics and very, very coordinated with do I love the thing we were building and do I love the people I was working with?

Lenny (00:12:43):
Following the thread of the people. I think one of the hardest things is really knowing what the people are like until you join. I think as a chief product officer joining or VP of product, you have a lot of time that you spend with the team. Most people don't. They have an interview and then they're like, all right, I got to make a decision. Do you have any advice for how to help people get a sense if the people are the kind of people they want to work with?

Tom Conrad (00:13:03):
I think people are really, really good at this. Every single time I've taken a job where it turned out that I was working with people who had a different set of values or working styles than I had, I knew. You tell yourself that, at least in my case, I tell myself a story about why the thing I suspect might be the case isn't the case. But you do this in your personal life all the time. You meet people out at dinner, so you get seated next to them at some industry event or something, and sometimes you come home and say to your partner, oh my gosh, the person next to me was just the worst. Then sometimes you're like, I think I made a permanent lifelong connection with this total stranger who just happened to sit next to me.

Lenny (00:13:55):
It's a very simple piece of advice that I think people don't fully appreciate is just trust your instinct, trust your gut. Just pay attention to what comes up when you're around people at a certain company. Okay, you brought up this phrase of notable disasters, and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. I just want to spend some time in these two areas. Maybe the way to set it up is, what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work and maybe advice you share with people?

Tom Conrad (00:14:37):
Probably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually, I think in both instances they became dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. Frankly, even in the case of pets.com, even the high profile nature of it.

(00:15:09):
I could have worked at one of a thousand E-commerce websites in 1999. When I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, they were like, I never heard of the thing that you worked on. But everybody certainly heard about pets.com. It's a pretty funny example too, of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. While as a leadership team, we made I'm sure all kinds of mistakes.

(00:15:39):
One of the things that happened was that there were three overfunded pet E-commerce sites. We all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then. We all thought it was a zero-sum game. That as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising, we all did. It became this unwinnable arms race. There is, I think, a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross. Or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise. Then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for three billion dollars. Biggest E-commerce acquisition of all time. Well, I think it's probably unfair to compare Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick and turned it into something really remarkable.

(00:17:07):
To pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way. The critique that is often leveled at pets.com, or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work. That's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It was really, really early.

Lenny (00:17:33):
I saw a stat, I think you shared somewhere, that you took pets.com from nothing to a public company to completely out of business in 19 months.

Tom Conrad (00:17:40):
Yeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. The leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. It was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. It was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was a fruitless attempt to salvage it.

Lenny (00:18:29):
Did not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?

Tom Conrad (00:18:40):
The miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it re-lit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, for 25 years or something. I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot. I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. It also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different.

(00:19:23):
I had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They're ridiculous. It's like maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, "Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?"

(00:19:42):
I'd be like, "No, I don't know anything about baking." "Oh, you like landscape photography. Do you take photos?" "No, I don't take photos." But I was committed to the bit, actually to the point where when Techwrench interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely. That story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was for New TV at the time.

(00:20:15):
The pitch was, we're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and consumer tech and weld it to the best of Hollywood style content production. To build something completely bespoke and purpose made for consumption on the phone. They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody, it just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them?

(00:20:50):
I listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. We kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow. Then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time, and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product.

(00:21:26):
Both of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself. Both of them had left after about six weeks. Meg's like, "We've raised all this money and we told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help. I would consider it a personal favor if you were to come and spend just a couple of days a week helping." She's like, "I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground." My wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist, and loves her life as a freelance contributor. She's like, "You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week. It's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it?" I'm like, "No. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself."

(00:22:27):
She's like, "No." She's like, "Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do." Well, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away. It was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch.

(00:22:58):
To take advantage of all of the modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. I'm embarrassed about some of what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience. I just really fell in love with the industry again, and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.

Lenny (00:23:35):
Is there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid? What to try to pull towards?

Tom Conrad (00:23:43):
I think I misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. That was always my ambition.

(00:24:16):
Find a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it really delightful way. Go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across. The really great word of mouth. But I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also like a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon.

(00:24:54):
Yes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation. I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money. But we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. It was a pretty major accomplishment. We made a bet that we would augment those sort of-

Tom Conrad (00:26:00):
And we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth, that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.

(00:26:26):
One super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired, so there was no back catalog of it. And it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out. It was really expensive, like I said, it was like a third of the investment we were going to making content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content.

(00:26:51):
And we launched two weeks into Covid and we couldn't make any of that content, except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube, that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood. Now, you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that.

(00:27:26):
But I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, it is enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger, and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself, because our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format.

(00:28:06):
And so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take 6 or 8 or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone could stomach.

Lenny (00:28:27):
Wow. I really like this metaphor and this mental model of the math formula of the entire business and thinking of it that way. I knew Covid changed the way people consumed content and that hurt. Quibi I think it was meant to be on the go, not sitting at home where you could watch anything you want. But also the fact that the content couldn't be made as well, as you were hoping to make.

Tom Conrad (00:28:46):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (00:28:49):
As a CPO, one of the biggest challenges is pushing back, trying to convince the founders of their mistakes, of doing what they want and just powering through it and dealing with it sometimes I guess is there anything you think you could have done looking back, or was the math formula set up for failure from the beginning and it's probably just not going to work out almost no matter what you did?

Tom Conrad (00:29:10):
One of the bets was that we weren't going to just use the apparatus of Hollywood to make the content. In part, we are going to use the apparatus of Hollywood to market the content. So Jeffrey had recruited this incredible Rolodex of literally the world's most famous celebrities to make shows for Quibi. We kind of had everyone either made something for launch or was going to make something.

(00:29:42):
And part of what they're going to do is turn up in culture and talk about their shows. We've heard a lot in the last six months about how hard it's to market movies because the stars can't go out and talk about the movies during the strike.

(00:29:54):
There was this theory that you could apply the marketing technique of Hollywood to get 20, 30 million people into the theater on opening weekend for Quibi. And that was always a very, very audacious take, I thought. Uber has all the money in the world to experiment with paid user acquisition, and they're not consistently a top 10 most downloaded app in the app store.

(00:30:26):
But the theory of Quibi, the math of Quibi, did require us to from day one land in the top 10 and stay there forever. The model would have worked if we could do that. And to the Hollywood marketing apparatus, the numbers that it takes to get there felt kind of small. If you can get 20 million people in to see Shrek on opening night new IP, surely you can get them to take their phone out of their pocket and download this thing and start a free trial.

(00:30:54):
Now, those of us who have spent our life in Silicon Valley making software and really, really tried to get people to show up and download new IP in large numbers know just how hard that is.

(00:31:09):
So maybe if I critique my own contribution to the math equation, maybe I should have beat the drum a little harder about just how unlikely it was that we were going to land the kind of distribution in month one that the model sort of required. If I had to go back and do it again, I think I would spend maybe more time investing and illuminating that aspect of the digital universe.

Lenny (00:31:42):
That is such a good takeaway of just showing the leaders, here's the data, here's the assumptions that we're all betting on, and do you believe this can happen? And they probably would've said, "Yes, this will happen. I'm so confident."

Tom Conrad (00:31:55):
What made it hard was, it wasn't structurally impossible. If you had to be bigger than any app that had ever been made, then you could probably make the case it's impossible. But since you only sort of had the land in the top 10, you couldn't quite say it was impossible, you could just say it was highly improbable.

(00:32:18):
And maybe one of my mistakes was, I guess I imagined that we would launch, and when the likely thing happened that we got millions of people to download the app, which we did, and then when we inevitably struggled to retain those users at high percentages, and we retained at what I think of as a good industry starting point, but we weren't setting any records on retention. I just imagined that what would happen next is the thing that happens in all young companies, you would iterate. You would grind on the funnel until a year later, two years later, six months later, whatever it is. You figured the formula out to get people in and get them to stay and get them to retain.

(00:33:12):
And what I didn't appreciate was just how quickly you go back to the foundational math and then the math really says you just can't. You can't spend two years iterating your way on optimizing the funnels like you would in a startup that had a different cost structure. In a world where you have to spend a billion dollars a year of making content, you just can't afford to not be a hit.

Lenny (00:33:40):
I think it's also important to just remind us, it's okay for these things to happen. People take a bet, as you said, we're going to try this thing, here's our bet, here's our experiment. We're betting on this sort of format in this business. We're going to raise money from investors that know they might lose all their money. And it sometimes doesn't work out. It's part of the game.

Tom Conrad (00:33:56):
It's certainly painful to take money from investors even if they know what they're doing and to not get them a return. I feel a real responsibility to investors to do better than we did at Quibi.

(00:34:08):
But yeah, I mean, there is a risk reward thing that goes along with these investments, and part of the reason they get all the riches on the upside is that they're going to bet on some Quibis along the way too.

Lenny (00:34:18):
So as you were talking, you said that it was called NewTV, and that sparked a memory, and I searched my email. And I actually got an email from a recruiter in 2018, we just kicked off a very special executive opportunity, the CPO at NewTV, a new venture in Los Angeles, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, raising a billion dollars, working with top talent. Are you interested in exploring this opportunity?

Tom Conrad (00:34:41):
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny. Your story could have been so much different.

Lenny (00:34:46):
This could have been Thomas podcast. Lenny, tell me about what happened at Quibi.

Tom Conrad (00:34:51):
I would take that free.

Lenny (00:34:54):
I don't know. There's pros and cons. They even sent this whole PDF, a TV in your pocket, NewTV. Amazing. All right. I'm going to read through this and see what they pitched back in the day.

(00:35:05):
Okay, let's move on to things that worked out really well, let's call it notable successes, other products you worked on that worked out great. So I'll list a few of them. And maybe what might be helpful is just we'll just go through each one and share what you took away from that experience, a lesson you learned from working on those products.

(00:35:23):
The ones that come to mind for me are Snap, Pandora, Apple if we want to go there. Also, you built, I don't know exactly what you did there, but you worked on You Don't Know Jack, this game that I loved. I think if you're an elder millennial, you're just going to like, "Oh my God, I love that game." I don't even remember it exactly, but I just remember the visceral feeling of playing that game and it was so much fun. So that's cool. I didn't know that you worked on that. And then there's also Sonos, which you're on the board.

(00:35:49):
So whatever order you think might be most interesting, just going through those and what did you learn from that experience?

Tom Conrad (00:35:56):
I worked at Apple in the interval where Steve was gone, John Skelly, that kind of period, so System 7, System 8, Power Macintosh, that whole era. And we were doing a lot. We shipped a bunch of great hardware. We transitioned the company from Motorola 68,000 CPUs to the Power PC architecture.

(00:36:19):
But, particularly in that transition, we really struggled to ship consumer software features. I mentioned that I wrote three LAN folders and some other consumer features in my first six months at Apple, and they shipped four years later, actually after I'd left the company. I was a little surprised they were still in the software repository even, candidly.

(00:36:40):
But I'll tell you that one of the things culturally about Apple in that moment was, at least I felt like, a person was really rewarded if they could make a kind of broad contribution across functions. So if you were a talented software engineer, but also a thoughtful product designer, and maybe also had interesting input on product marketing, that you could build a really great reputation inside the company by playing all of those positions a little bit day to day.

(00:37:19):
And so when I left Apple after four years, I look back on my time, I didn't ship as much software as I had hoped, and I felt like a little bit like a professional gadfly. I was six miles wide and a centimeter deep.

(00:37:36):
And I went to work for this company called Berkeley Systems. In addition to You Don't Know Jack, they made a flying toaster screensaver, if you remember. You remember the nineties?

Lenny (00:37:48):
How could you forget that?

Tom Conrad (00:37:50):
And when I met them, they were picking off this game development for this trivia game, and were looking for someone to lead the technical team. And so I joined as technical director for the You Don't Know Jack franchise, managed a team of engineers, and it was a completely different culture than what I was used to at Apple.

(00:38:11):
It was certainly the case that I was welcome to weigh in on the game design or the marketing or some other aspect of the deliverables, but my job was to build the software on time with high quality, period. And if I did those things, I'd be rewarded. And if I didn't, I would not be successful. And no amount of insightful feedback on the gameplay or the packaging, or whatever else I might want to do, was going to benefit me and my career at all.

(00:38:48):
And it was such a blessing to be forced to go deep on something, because I spent a lot of time developing chops as an engineering manager, but I also wrote a ton of software. And that's really honestly when I became a software engineer. My college education was insufficient to get me there, and the amount of software I wrote at Apple was insufficient to get me there. But I came out of my Berkeley Systems You Don't Know Jack experience feeling like I could really hold my own technically in a way that just wouldn't have happened.

(00:39:20):
And so I do think that there's something to be said for a culture where there are swim lanes and people are encouraged to be really, really exceptional in their lane. And so I feel really lucky that I stumbled into You Don't Know Jack When I did.

(00:39:36):
And it was also, I mean, it was the first thing that I worked on that had just huge cultural awareness for a couple of years. I mean, it's crazy, they're still making sequels. It has been nearly 30 years, and there are versions of You Don't Know Jack that are in all of the stores, in the PlayStation store, in the Xbox store, in the iOS store. You can play new versions of You Don't Know Jack to this day. It's crazy.

Lenny (00:40:07):
Did not know that. I see the website now and it's a little different, but basically the same.

Tom Conrad (00:40:13):
So I'd say my lesson from You Don't Know Jack was definitely, it really does pay to get good at something and not just be a generalist.

(00:40:24):
And then, I mean Pandora, it wasn't quite the next thing that happened. After You Don't Know Jack was Pets.com, and then after Pets.com there was nuclear winter in the industry and I worked in enterprise software for a while.

(00:40:37):
And after nuclear winter I had this idea that I was going to build a destination for music discovery on the web. And I've been doing enterprise software, the consumer intranet was non-existent for those years, early aughts.

(00:40:54):
But around 2004, things started to thaw a little bit and you started to hear the first signs of the companies that we came to call Web 2.0, Flickr would've been one of the early examples. And one of the enterprise software things I did was a personalization recommendation engine that used a vector space. It's like a lot of the things that we're talking about now in AI, albeit 20 years ago.

(00:41:21):
And so I knew something about recommendation systems in the enterprise space, and I was super passionate about music. I'm not a musician, but I was that kid in college who would corner you and be like, oh, if you like this band, I got to play this for you and [inaudible 00:41:37] with stereo until you would beg to leave.

(00:41:40):
And so I had this idea that maybe I can use the internet to do that at scale, not with just one person, but with hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people maybe. Introduce them to music that they would love but otherwise would miss out on.

(00:41:53):
And I promised that I was going to tell stories about luck in my career, there's been a gazillion of them. But one really dramatic incidence of that is I was sort of biding my time to exit this enterprise software company. I was VP of engineering, a whole team that reported to me. I felt a lot of responsibility to exit in a responsible way. But I was really excited about this digital music company that I was going to start. But I wasn't telling anyone at all because I didn't want ti to get back to the team.

(00:42:25):
So I flew down to Los Angeles to go out to Coachella in the spring of 2004, and completely randomly physically bumped into a guy that I had gone to high school with on the polo field, and hadn't seen him in a decade. And the thing that we had in common in high school was we loved music. And so I tell them the story of, I'm going to start this company to do personalized digital music on the internet. And he said, there's this woman I work with who just left our company to move to Oakland to work for this little company called Savage Beast that are also doing something in music recommendation. Do you want to talk to them? And I said, "Sure, why not?"

(00:43:11):
So I got introduced to Tim Westergren, who was the founder of Savage Beast. Savage Beast was like a seven or eight full-time employees at that point. They made a music recommendation engine that they licensed to other companies to put in consumer products. So Savage Beast's customers were Best Buy, who put it in kiosks, and AOL, who used it on the AOL Music website. And they were looking for a VP of engineering. And I got the offer, thought about it a little bit. I declined because it was kind of this B2B2C thing and I really wanted to do something consumer and I had an idea about the app.

(00:43:49):
And a month later, they called again and said, "We keep talking to people. We really think that you're the person." And interestingly, one of the reasons they thought that I was the person is they were really impressed by the fact that I had run engineering at Pets.com. So I mean, it's just one of those things where these things do pay dividends, even when they're a disaster.

(00:44:07):
And honestly, what I would really say was almost like a lapse in judgment, I said yes, even though it wasn't the product that I wanted to build. And I won't bore you with all of the details, but 90 days later, after some typical early stage founder drama stuff, the founding head of technology and product had resigned completely unrelated to my arrival. And the company had a new CEO, Joe Kennedy, and Joe had this idea for what he called the 1-Click Personal Radio. And Joe is a product marketer and just the best CEO in the whole world. We spent 10 years together building Pandora.

(00:44:51):
And he sort of gave me the keys and just said, "As long as it fits the brief for 1-Click Personal Radio, it's all yours." And I got to build the team and the culture, in collaboration with him and Tim the founder, over the course of the next 10 years, and just every good thing.

(00:45:14):
So I mean, there's just a million billion lessons from Pandora, and everything I am as a product leader and then an engineering leader comes from things that happen at Pandora.

(00:45:24):
But maybe the thing that I think of first is, I think we met our early audience in an incredibly genuine way. For example, when we launched the support@pandora.com was an alias for all@pandora.com. So if you sent a customer service request to Pandora, every single person in the company received it. And because we made a decision to have no customer support team in the first year, the expectation was that whoever sees the request first should respond to it.

(00:46:01):
And so you would write to us and you would get the founder or you'd get me or you'd get the engineer who wrote the feature or you'd get the CEO. And there were no macros to respond to commonly asked question. There was no read the FAQ. And there were no rules about what you could and couldn't say. If the person's like, "I think this feature is stupid and broken," we would encourage people to say, "You know what? I think you're right and I'm really struggling to get our stupid head of product to agree with me. I'm going to CC Tom and maybe we can convince him that this was a bad decision."

(00:46:35):
And we did all of that because we thought one of our superpowers as a young company was that we could just engage with our audience as real human beings, not as a shiny brand that was trying to be something that we could just never be. This period is where the iPod and iTunes are at the peak of their powers. And so there was no way we could sort of out-Apple Apple on the brand front.

(00:47:02):
And so we were just ourselves, and I think it really, really was a catalyst for the word of mouth that developed around Pandora. And we never spent any money on paid user acquisition, literally no dollars in the entire time I was there, because people loved the product and they told their friends about it and that's how it grew.

Lenny (00:47:21):
I saw a stat that you grew Pandora from 0 to 80 million users, from 10 employees to 3000 employees, from 0 basically to a multi-billion dollar company.

Tom Conrad (00:47:31):
We did those things. We did.

(00:47:34):
Also, I think my product stewardship in some ways set the scene for Spotify to walk through the digital streaming door and show us the exit. So Pandora is, again, such a privilege to be able to work on something that touched and continues to touch tens of millions of people's lives every month. But it's bittersweet from the standpoint that I think we had an opportunity that in some ways we misplayed.

Lenny (00:48:06):
My mom is still a huge fan of Pandora, uses it every day for whatever choice.

Tom Conrad (00:48:10):
I mean, it's still going. And the numbers are still tens of millions of people in the US listen every month. So it's a thing. But yeah, it's a little sad that it didn't have quite the staying power that some of these other things that have come along since have.

Lenny (00:48:25):
Just on that topic, do you think there's something that you could have done, someone could have done? Do you think there was an opportunity to become Spotify? Or is it the business model and the math formula was set up in such a way that it was near impossible?

Tom Conrad (00:48:37):
One of the things that was tough for Pandora was that when we started it, digital music was a category that no investor wanted to touch. It was lawsuits. There was no money to be made. There were relationships with the labels that were completely impossible to nurture. And there had been no big outcomes. I think the biggest exit in digital music when we got going was I think Yahoo had bought Musicmatch for like $400 million. And so that was seen as kind of the ceiling on the opportunity.

(00:49:08):
And along the way we found investors who believed in our vision and invested ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars in the company over its pre-public years. But there was never investor enthusiasm for the company in the category that was anything like the investor enthusiasm that a company like Spotify enjoyed just six, seven years later, Snap enjoyed for its pre-public tenure.

(00:49:35):
And I think part of what was different for Spotify is that the comps were not... Musicmatch was 400 million, they were Pandora at 8 billion, but even above that they were Netflix at 100 billion. And so investors just had this new sort of optimism about what you could do in subscription and in streaming, and Spotify really played that to their advantage in a way that we couldn't because we had gone public and the public market investors were still trying to figure us out. So we didn't have access to capital. It was very hard for us to take the same kind of risks that Spotify took.

(00:50:17):
But then I think we just completely misjudged one really important thing, which is that we were really inspired by disrupting terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is the predominant form of music consumption in the country. People spend, I can't remember the exact stats, but by minutes consumed, it's something like 10 times more music minutes a month on radio in the aughts and early tens than on owned music. And the advertising supported sort of radio market was a $30 billion category, and recorded music was $8 billion.

(00:50:57):
And so we had this idea that we're going to reinvent radio, and Spotify and Rdio and Apple Music and the 14 others, Rhapsody, which was Spotify before Spotify, they were all going to chase this smaller owned recorded music opportunity, and that we could be left relatively alone over here going after the less sexy but actually bigger market. And I think we just got it wrong. It should have been obvious that inevitably all of your music in any format was going to be delivered as a stream from the cloud. And that the record labels in particular, they were going to set the terms on what the structure was. And the structure that they preferred was the Spotify structure. And we operated under a different licensing...

Tom Conrad (00:52:01):
And we operated under a different licensing regime that they hated, that was a statutory license that we got from the government. And it would've been exceptionally risky for us to come out from under the statutory license and do direct deals with the labels, but it was a requirement to play in the world that they imagined as the future, and we should have imagined as the future, too. And eventually, the company got around to it, but it was too late.

Lenny (00:52:29):
It's interesting that so much of this was rooted in that original vision that you shared of Pandora of the radio, smart radio in your pocket, [inaudible 00:52:37] personal radio that you just stayed on that track, even though there was this other track. But I think it's important to point out, you said it was seven years later. And I feel like there's this interesting trend with the companies you've worked at, pets.com and Pandora, that it's too early, you just come too early at these ideas. And I feel like that tells me Quibi might still happen. There's a Quibi coming seven years from now.

Tom Conrad (00:52:59):
You know what's really funny about that? Just today, there's a headline about a Hollywood-produced show that's launching on Instagram Reels and TikTok that was shot vertical. And the headline is literally something like, "Is TikTok the new TV?" And it's pretty funny that literally, that's what Jeffrey and Meg called it when they were incubating the idea. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that purpose-built video for mobile looks a lot like TikTok. And I don't want to take anything away from all of the innovation in that space that they and the other players are driving that Quibi didn't capture in its initial product definition. But I mean, obviously, we stare at our phones consuming video of all kinds all day every day. So there there's definitely something there.

Lenny (00:53:53):
The PDF that I mentioned that I got from the recruiter, the first page again says, "You have a TV in your pocket." So it's exactly what they're pitching. That's amazing. All right. I think what I've learned, I need to bet all my money on this new Quibi clone because the timing might be right.

(00:55:18):
Let's talk about Snap briefly, and then I want to have a couple more questions.

Tom Conrad (00:55:21):
At Pandora, I was the head of product and was head of engineering. And our CEO was brilliant, but he was a product marketer. I mean, Joe was all things. He was an engineer by education, and a great marketer, and a great finance person, and just such a utility player at a very, very high level across every discipline. But he was also really, really good at letting his team do their jobs. He really let me run product and engineering. And so not only did I have tremendous latitude to make good and bad decisions about product, I also really got a seat at the table to help lead the company. So rewarding, so gratifying. Best professional experience that one could have.

(00:56:05):
So I leave Pandora after a decade. I take a year trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. But after about a year, I got introduced to Evan. And it's kind of a funny story. A mutual friend sent this introduction over. Evan immediately responded and said, "Why don't you come down to Los Angeles and have a coffee with me?" So I fly down. It's not clear if it's a job interview or what it is really. I mean, I was just lightly exploring things that were out there and was a big fan of what he was doing with Snapchat. So I spent 45 minutes with him, and then I spent 45 minutes with the head of engineering, and another 45 minutes with the head of legal, and then they tossed me into a conference room with a dozen product designers, all in their mid to late 20s, many of which had gone to school at Stanford with Evan.

(00:57:01):
I would come to learn all really, really, really impressive super, super talented people, but it was just 10 of us sitting around a conference table. And it wasn't really clear that they knew why they were talking to me, but we had an hour long free ranging conversation. And so I left, and I thought it was a totally fascinating morning, but I wasn't sure what had happened, really. It was like "Well, with these interviews, it all seemed very ad hoc. Is there a job opening?" It was a little odd. And I went to lunch on Abbott Kinney and got a text from Evan's admin saying, "Can you come back to the office? Have you gotten on your plane yet?" I was like, "I was just ordering lunch. I'll just come back right away."

(00:57:49):
So I go back. Now, it's one o'clock in the afternoon. This entire thing started at nine o'clock in the morning. I sit down in the conference room. Evan comes in with a manila envelope and says, " We loved you. We'd like for you to be our VP of product," and handed me a written offer, all the terms, the stock compensation, the whole thing. I'm gobsmacked. I'm flattered, that this is really playing to my ego. I can't believe that this company that feels like maybe the most interesting thing that's happening in consumer tech, that their notoriously brilliant and mercurial founder has taken enough of a shine to me that he wants to give at least some of the keys to the product kingdom over after such a short courtship.

(00:58:34):
So I leave, and when some of that buzz wears off, I start to wonder if there's some red flags here maybe. So I tell Evan, "Listen, I'd like to come back and meet more of the leadership team and spend more time with you, go a little deeper on what this means." And so we extend our courtship by another week or so, and I'm super impressed by the rest of the leadership team and the product thinkers and the designers and things that I was going to get to work with on a daily basis. And so I take the job full knowing that it's going to be wildly different than Pandora, where I had all of this latitude to do whatever I might want to do, and in the context of Snapchat, at best, I was going to be Evan's right hand, a person that principally executed his vision.

(00:59:29):
And that's certainly what it was. I mean, Evan and I ended up having a really great collaboration, but it was certainly most days, I was executing on his vision, both at a high level, and very much in the details. And Evan's truly brilliant, I mean, and he's also actually a really nice guy. I think in some ways, he gets a bad rep for... He has very high standards, but he's a very kind person, in my experiences with him. But it was a super exhausting job and not as soul satisfying as I wanted it to be. And after a couple of years, like I said, I thought maybe I just wanted to make croissants or something.

(01:00:14):
But one really, really big important lesson that I learned at Snap is about risk taking. And when you have the financial support and the foundational relationship with your investors that Evan has, it really allowed him to take these really big swings, acquire a technology that he thought was game changing, build features speculatively that maybe would be pruned in any other product roadmap planning process because the odds of them having an outsized impact were modest. And it just allowed him time after time to make bets that paid off, and we forget about the ones that don't work when there are so many home runs in those years. And we didn't have... Environmentally, we weren't set up for that at Pandora, but I think in some ways, I wasn't temperamentally inclined to those kinds of big swings. And I think I take bigger risks and encourage bigger swings now because of things I learned from Evan and Snap.

Lenny (01:01:18):
That is an awesome story. It resonates a lot with what Brian shared about how he thinks about product now and just telling people what to build versus very bottom up, "Tell us ideas you have." That impact, the way you run, we're going to talk a bit about you as CEO now, but I guess, do you have a place that you try to be of CEO as, "Here's what we're building"?

Tom Conrad (01:01:40):
As a product-oriented CEO, how much you should lean in to the details versus set direction and create an environment where great people can do great work, I suspect there's not one answer that applies to every company stage. When I was at Apple, one of the reasons that we struggled to ship things is that Apple did a great job of assembling incredibly, incredibly smart and talented people. Just everyone around me at that early stage in my career was so, so inspiring. But one of the side effects of that is we would get in a room and we would turn over some problem or opportunity, and we would talk ourselves out of every good solution because it wasn't perfect. I used to joke that Apple was the only place in the world where a vote of a thousand to one was a tie because that one person would be so thoughtful in their critique that the other thousand people would be like, "Hmm, that's right, that's right." And even though there's been this huge consensus of what the right answer was, we would talk ourselves out of making decisions.

Lenny (01:02:50):
That one wasn't Steve Jobs, necessarily? It could be somebody else?

Tom Conrad (01:02:53):
He wasn't there.

Lenny (01:02:55):
Wow.

Tom Conrad (01:02:56):
So I think what broke Apple out of that mode was Steve came back and they didn't vote anymore. Steve was just making the call. And so I have some sympathy for Brian and Evan, who have these big, thousands of people working for them. And as they delegate, they grow frustrated that there's not progress at the pace that they're looking for, and that there's indecision, and the people on the teams report that there's just churn and no progress, and there's fiefdoms and politics and all the rest, and that as the CEO, as a brilliant product-oriented CEO, they are uniquely situated to come in and cut through all of that garbage and get the trains running on time again.

(01:03:49):
Having said all of that, I also think that it can be a mistake to be that kind of leader in a smaller org because part of the opportunity in a small org is to assemble a group of people that are incredibly talented that believe in your mission and where who you can easily influence with a much lighter touch and set them up to build a culture in an organization that can execute. And so I see my job as CEO is to try to surf that edge of I'm really in the details. So I deeply understand the business and the product decisions that we're making and the processes that we're using to run the business, but not overplay my hand with respect to dictating outcomes.

(01:04:40):
The one thing you'll always have as CEO is, no matter how much you tell the team that when I swing by their virtual desk and say, "I've been thinking about this little detail that's not important right now, but what do you think?" It's like nine out of 10 times, that person is going to go and start working on that thing. And so you do have to be just really careful about the way you engage in some of those details, I think.

Lenny (01:05:06):
There's a really good episode I had with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he shared this framework called flash tags that they use at Coda, and I think it comes from HubSpot, of you tell people, "Here's what the subpoena is. Is it an FYI? Is it a suggestion? Is it a do this?" There's four of them and one's like, "I will die on this hill. You need to do this."

Tom Conrad (01:05:27):
I try to do a lot of that. I wish I could say that in my experience that that pays off. I spend an awful lot of time, even the stuff I say very clearly, just one person's opinion, focus group of one, "Don't change your priorities to go work on this," it has more of an outsized impact on people's behavior than I intended.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Yeah. Easier said than done. Coming back to your journey, we've talked through the story up until getting to Quibi, but two years ago, you went in a whole new direction, and you're now the CEO of a company called Zero. What is it like to move from just being a product leader or engi leader at a company to being the CEO for the first time? Why did you choose Zero as that role? And what have you learned as CEO that you wish you knew as a product leader or engi leader at a company that listeners might find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:06:19):
It's been a really, really incredible couple of years. In the aftermath of Quibi, I spent a lot of time, as we all do, soul-searching about what I learned and what I might want to do next. And as I thought about it, I realized that I really wanted to move on to something where I can have a direct impact on the culture and values of the company that I was involved in. I really got that opportunity at Pandora in a big way. And I had spent the five years of Snapchat and Quibi working for Evan and Meg and Jeffrey who are all incredible business leaders, but have their own very specific style and approach, and that leaves a mark on the culture that's unique to the founder.

(01:07:04):
And then as we've discussed, I'm always really interested in building things that are near and dear to me, and I was particularly thinking about what can I do that could have a really positive impact on the world in my next chapter. I've built an awful lot of media stuff through the years, video games and streaming services and so forth, and it seemed like maybe there was something that had a little bit more weight to it that I could spend my time on. And so my first thought was I would start something, a company idea I was quietly workshopping for some months. And completely independent from all of that, it's eight months into the pandemic, and my own personal health was at an all time low. I was 50 or 60 pounds overweight, my cholesterol was in the red zone. I mean, I was out of breath climbing stairs, which is something that I had never encountered in my life before.

(01:07:59):
I'm a bit of a yo-yo dieter and I'm always critical of looking in the mirror, but I was never ever really worried about my health, my longevity, and suddenly, I was. And so my solution to that was to go really deep on metabolic health, just thousands of hours of podcasts and videos and glucose monitoring patches and Oura Rings and digital fitness gear and just to try to understand the things that impact health and longevity. And as much as I would like to report that what I learned is that there's some magic pill that you can take, maybe some off label rapamycin or something, the truth is, is that to live a longer and healthier life, you really have to attack what I would call metabolic disease, which will manifest in overweight and obesity and pre-diabetes and diabetes and high cholesterol and all of these things that impact your long-term health.

(01:08:59):
And so I found Zero in this path and was using it to help with my own health journey. And Mike Maser founded the company four and a half years ago, and he and I were talking in this interval about my own experience with the product. I was just giving him product feedback and so forth, and he was telling me a little bit about his own entrepreneurial journey. And somewhere in the conversation, Mike said, "My intention is to step up into the executive chair role and to find a CEO for the company." So again, in my story, just over and over and over, this incredibly fortuitous thing happened. I just knew immediately that it ticked all the boxes, "Here's a chance to lead something that already had some momentum to impact the culture and values in a really direct way and was really, really close to my own personal journey."

(01:09:50):
And so we know we've got a great little company and 27 people, we've got more than a million users on the platform every month. Over a hundred thousand of them pay us with tens of millions of dollars of revenue through the years, and have had double-digit growth even coming out of the pandemic when lots of health and fitness companies saw retreats. And most importantly, it actually works. 75% of the people who use the platform lose weight. People lose, on average, five to 10% of their body weight in the first 60 days. And because of the success that people have, we grow just completely organically. We have no paid user acquisition at all. It's really a word of mouth business.

(01:10:31):
But that's not to say that it's not challenging. All startups are challenging. And what we've really focused on for the last couple of years is we've been really focused on unit economics, really trying to understand how much value can we derive and deliver for every person who downloads and installs the app, how do we convert them through all of the funnels efficiently and get them engaged with the product and get them to retain and drive that up in a really systematic way. And with my whole career, I'm definitely a person who started off thinking software development was mostly an art form, you find brilliant visionaries who have a deep understanding of human behavior, and they craft solutions for problems that other people don't see, and they make them delightful, and they get all the little details right. And when you found product market fit for the art, then you optimize them through a really quantitative take.

(01:11:34):
And so I'm definitely a person that sees both sides of that left brain and right brain equation that's important in software. But here's the thing my eyes have really opened to in the last two years. While companies are definitely the software that they make and the products that they deliver and that there is an art and science to that, as I described, there is also, if you step back, there is an equation that describes the business. It talks about how you turn investment into returns. And I suppose if I had come up with finance and been a business major that maybe that's the way that I would've conceived of companies to begin with. So maybe it's a little embarrassing that I had to be 53 years old before, I think, the scales fell through my eyes and I was like, "Oh, companies are equations."

(01:12:24):
And so when we first started talking about lifetime value and customer acquisition costs and getting those two things balanced and just the thinking about the unit economics of the business, my natural instinct was to go immediately to the leaf nodes of the equation like, "Oh, what percentage of people do we convert from install to registered and from registered to trial," and these very way down at the bottom of all the funnels and to ask the product team like, "Let's try to optimize these." And in the process though of trying to understand where we could take the business as we optimize those various dimensions and trying to understand too which of the dimensions had the most leverage, I started building these ever more sophisticated models that describe the whole business.

(01:13:16):
I mean, in startups, you get to wear a lot of hats. And definitely a hat that I'm wearing that I didn't anticipate at all is I'm the full-time FP&A guy for Zero. And so I built this spreadsheet that aggregates data from all of our business intelligence tools and raw data from our subscription transactions and looks at all of our historical results and all of our expenses and spend and then could use that to predict future scenarios by manipulating all of these variables. And it's just not at all the way I ever thought about products before. And I know that you've got lots of listeners like, "This guy's an idiot. This is a fundamental way to contemplate product work."

(01:14:05):
But if there's anybody out there like me who thought of it as art first and then optimization in the details, it is really, really powerful to spend the time to create the model that describes the whole thing so you can identify what are the high leverage points to focus on. So been doing a lot of that at the company in the last two years and it's really starting to deliver incredible results. Like everything in life, I mean, you sign up for things so you can learn, and that's the big one for me in the last year.

Lenny (01:14:36):
I really love that takeaway of as a CEO coming back to share, here's what you should be thinking about that the CEO is probably thinking about, as a product leader, you may not be, of trying to actually spend the time to think about the business model and understand it deeply because your founders are thinking about it all the time. And so if you're not, you're missing out on here's a way to influence them, here's a way to...

Tom Conrad (01:14:57):
It's so funny too because it's a thing I suddenly understand something that mystified me through my entire career, which was I'd go to board meetings and the investors would ask these probing questions, but they were really never about the product and what the product did and what the product roadmap was and what the features were and what this... It all seemed to operate at this level that was almost completely independent of the details of the "what is the solution you put into the world", which as a product-oriented thinker, was just completely baffling to me. And I now realize that they were tilling the soil that I'm talking about, they were tilling.

(01:15:39):
It doesn't really matter what the screens are and what the features are. I mean, it certainly matters, but that there's another higher order way to look at a company, which is really about the optimization of this equation. And I think particularly, if you sit on 25 boards, it's probably a much more efficient way to evaluate how your companies are doing and where to spend your time and how to help by thinking about them abstracted up at that layer. So I will never stop thinking about software development as being an art form and I will never stop enjoying the days when I get to lean in on the details, but it's been pretty eyeopening.

Lenny (01:16:18):
The other thing that stands out here, one is I think this is especially true for consumer subscription apps, which I've done some research on. And basically, they never work. There's Duolingo, there's Zero, which I didn't know how much scale you guys reached. My math here real quick. So you have a million users, a hundred thousand paying users. You charge at 10 bucks a month. I know there's a discount for an annual plan, but basically, you're making somewhere around a million dollars a month, which you don't have to confirm or deny it, but that's the math I just did, and that's crazy. So congrats. That's a rare successful consumer subscription app. It never happens.

Tom Conrad (01:16:53):
And like I said, every startup is hard, and I never stop being surprised at the new hard things that pop up every day. But we're on a really great run. We've had a tremendous year, and I'm just so, so proud of the team we've assembled. They're incredible for the last.

Lenny (01:17:08):
Part of the reason you're so successful is exactly what you said. There's a huge focus on LTV/CAC, the math formula, because for these sorts of businesses, the crux of it is can you acquire people for less money than you need to spend?

Tom Conrad (01:17:21):
One thing that's really fortunate for Zero is Mike Maser, who founded the company, and I have both been around the block long enough and enough times that we remember 2008, we remember 2000. And so in these moments in the pandemic, there were companies in our category that were raising hundreds of billions of dollars with the intention of throwing it at paid user acquisition. And we made a conscious decision to optimize the value of the organic traffic that we were getting and to drive our growth through LTV expansion rather than top of funnel expansion, which was candidly not in fashion in 2021, 2022.

Tom Conrad (01:18:00):
... in 2021, 2022. It turns out it's much more in fashion these days as companies are called upon to be much more capital efficient than they were during the pandemic era. I guess I feel somewhat fortunate that my natural inclination as an entrepreneur is more in sync with the expectations of the market than it was for a while.

Lenny (01:18:27):
Okay. So you've probably had the longest career arc of anyone I've had on this podcast. You've worked at all of these different companies in a lot of different phases. You're still at it. And I'm curious what you've learned about how to maintain your mental health and avoid burnout essentially through this journey. You mentioned you take some time off. Is there anything else you found or is that a trick of just how to not burnout?

Tom Conrad (01:18:51):
Do you know this Japanese concept called Ikigai?

Lenny (01:18:55):
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but share it. Share it for folks that may not be familiar.

Tom Conrad (01:18:59):
So the idea is it's a Venn diagram and there are four spheres. There's a sphere that's labeled what you love. There's a sphere labeled what you're good at. There's a sphere labeled what the world needs, and there's a sphere called what you can be paid for, and where they all intersect is this Japanese idea, Ikigai. It's the intersection of what you're good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. If you find that, it's Ikigai. And interestingly, your listeners should go and find this because there are interesting ways to label the other intersections, the intersections where all four don't come together. And what's really interesting is that the ones that are three but not four, I think because they're the ones that are close but not quite to this really satisfying thing. And so it's like when you find those, it's really easy to choose a job or to choose a path where you have three but not four, which is a really great recipe if you're feeling like there's something just out of your reach that's really important.

(01:20:09):
Anyway, it's a great framework to think about your life and your career. So to start, I'm incredibly lucky that it's all Ikigai for me. What I'm good at, what I love, what the world needs, what I get paid for, they have always overlapped. And a big part of it is just what I love is this world. I love software, I love building software, I love writing software, I love using software. People are like, "What are your hobbies?" I don't think I have any hobbies and I think about, "Well, what kinds of things do I do on the weekend for fun?" And it's like I'm teaching myself After Effects or something, which I will immediately forget, but it's just fun to go really deep on some piece of interesting software.

(01:21:02):
So I'm very lucky. And so I think that has been super sustaining for me. One of the reasons I've been able to do it as long as I have without really burning out is that just, it's what I do. And in some ways it's why I come back to it. It's easy to say, "I'm going to become a pastry chef," but left to my own devices, I use software, I make software. It's my hobby, it's my passion, it's all the things.

(01:21:29):
But a couple of thoughts about how one engages with their work. One thing is I'm really not a #hustling kind of leader. There was a woman that I worked with on the Finder just out of college that left a really big mark on me. My own style of work then, I think I mentioned my memory of flashing, blinking the folder animation was a 2: 00 AM kind of thing. I was 23 years old. I woke up at 11 o'clock in the morning. I went to the office, I screwed around and played video games in the Apple Arcade and went to a couple of meetings and had lunch and stood at the whiteboard and pontificated about some nonsense. And then about four o'clock every day I would start writing software and I would write software until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and then I would go out to dinner with people from the team in the middle of it and whatever.

(01:22:29):
And so it kind of looked like I spent 14 hours a day, six or seven days a week at Apple, and I was celebrated for this. There was lots of nights where I would work clear through the night and my boss would come in the next morning, he'd be like, "Are you still here?" And I'm like, "I'm still here. Look at this cool thing I did." And I got a lot of attention for that. And then there's this woman on the team who showed up every single morning at 8:30, sat at her desk, wrote a ton of great software, and every night packed her stuff up and left. And she contributed more than I ever did. And I don't think she got the same kind of recognition that I got because of the way she did the work.

(01:23:11):
And when we were building the team and culture at Pandora, I thought about her a lot and really made a point of saying that I just wasn't interested in performative contribution, that it's the work that matters and what I want to celebrate is if you can show up and do it and go home and have other things in your life, because I think that's a recipe for being able to do it on a sustained basis rather than burning yourself out.

(01:23:38):
I think there's some nuance in this. I think 22 year old me was always going to want to work through the night. And so I think creating space that that's okay too is important. And I think maybe in some ways at Pandora it was almost like that wasn't okay. It was like, "You should be taking more breaks. Why are you going this hard?" But I do try to create environments where people have a reasonable balance between their regular life and their technology life or room for that if they choose it. And I do think that that has through the years, has helped me keep at it, but I still work a lot of nights and weekends because I love it. It's what I do.

(01:24:16):
Here's the other thing. I got very, very lucky with the Pandora experience and got this outsized, probably inappropriate financial reward for being a part of it and gave me options that I never imagined that I would have. And so after 10 years I left and I didn't know what I would do, but I did really need a break. It was a really hard job and that was definitely a moment where I needed some time to recover. But I think if you had asked me on that first day, I would say, "I don't know why these people find success and then start another company right away. Why? There's so many things you could do in the world, why would you start another company? It's so hard."

(01:25:02):
And I was particularly in love with the idea that I had access to experience. I didn't really care about things, I didn't want a fancy watch or whatever, a car, but I wanted to see the world. And so I thought, "I'm going to just go and I'm going to live in London for three months, then I come back to San Francisco for a month. I'm going to go live in Mexico City for three months and I'm going to just have this life where I'm soaking up experiences." And after doing that for six months, the thing that I came to realize is that what I care about way more than experiences is relationships. If you're the person who is constantly on a plane seeking out some new experience, it's really hard to form and maintain intimate, satisfying relationships.

(01:25:47):
So I went back to San Francisco, I'm like, "I can't be all over the world if I want to be engaged with friends and like-minded people." And you know what people do on Monday morning? They go to work. And so if you want to be engaged with humanity, where they are on Monday morning is at work. And so more than I had the itch to build things, which I do very much have, I had the itch to collaborate, to be in the game with other people. So that was what took me to Snapchat, took me out of chasing experiences and took me back to building again. And then as we've already described, at a point I thought, "Well, I care about this collaboration, but maybe it doesn't need to be software that I'm creating in the world." And Quibi gave me a chance to fall back in love with that process again. And here we are, more software.

Lenny (01:26:48):
Plus being on a board of a hardware company. What you just shared reminds me of Mark Manson's book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. Have you read this book?

Tom Conrad (01:26:58):
I have not.

Lenny (01:26:59):
Okay. It sold a bazillion copies, and the core of it is that we get joy out of solving problems and we think we'll be happy when we have freedom to do nothing. But it turns out freedom is only helpful to help us discover the problems we just want to keep solving.

Tom Conrad (01:27:16):
Yeah, totally. I think that's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:27:20):
It sounds like that's the experience you went on. Last question, this new segment, I'm going to call Contrarian Corner. And the question is, is there something that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't?

Tom Conrad (01:27:35):
There's a segment in our industry that believes this very intensely, which is there's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. And I think in some ways our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. I use an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere, that would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has, as I described, the mathematical formula that's going to win, that has the market opportunity that's the right size, that has the 10X thinking that can really... And I'm a little biased here because while I am a CEO for the first time now, I've never been a founder and I've been lucky enough to find a bunch of young teams that could benefit from my skills and enthusiasms, and sometimes to some success and sometimes to some embarrassment, but always really, really interesting.

(01:28:53):
Yeah. If you're out there and you think that the only possible way you can be successful in this industry on any metric, whatever metric you care about: you want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want any of the things that people aspire to, outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.

Lenny (01:29:24):
I 100% agree with that. I'm always telling people, "Don't start a company. It's super painful, very rarely works out. It's so hard." I don't know what's harder, being a product manager or being a founder, probably being a founder. They're both very hard.

Tom Conrad (01:29:37):
Yeah, it is quite hard too. Yeah. Yeah. And just to be perfectly clear, there's something really special about founders. At both Pandora and now at Zero, the actual founders have from time to time said, "Well, you're like a founder." And I'm like, "I'm nothing like a founder. You took all the risk. When I showed up, there was a team and there was momentum and there was money in the bank. I appreciate your desire to say complimentary things, but 'You're like a founder' is not one that I'll take."

Lenny (01:30:08):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tom Conrad (01:30:11):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:30:13):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Tom Conrad (01:30:17):
I really love Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook. It's organized into chapters about foundational company building, building a leadership team, building a board, and in addition to the thoughtful synthesis on that topic from Elad, he has an interview of someone that he does relevant to that section on each of the chapters. Really, really great read and super actionable if you're a leader in a young company. In a completely different end of the spectrum, I love big, complicated science fiction and there's a lot of garbage science fiction out there to be sure, but when you find something special, it's the best. So probably through the years in that category, there's a book called Hyperion by Dan Simmons. That's just a total classic. Everybody should read it.

Lenny (01:31:08):
I read that. I think I read the first couple in the first one.

Tom Conrad (01:31:11):
Yeah. There is a sequel that's exceptional as well. And it's probably worth warning your readers that Hyperion is quite long and has an absolute cliffhanger.

Lenny (01:31:21):
I think they're making a show out of it, which is going to be wild. I don't know how they do a show around that book. I thought you were going to say this other book, A Fire Upon the Deep. Have you heard of this book?

Tom Conrad (01:31:29):
Oh, that's so good too.

Lenny (01:31:31):
Okay. That's also very complicated, but incredible.

Tom Conrad (01:31:34):
Yeah, I had completely forgotten about that. That's a very special book. There's a couple in that series too.

Lenny (01:31:40):
Yeah, I think I only read the first one. Also, Three-Body Problem is the other one that I always think about. It's come up a couple of times on this podcast. Let's move on to the next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or a TV show?

Tom Conrad (01:31:53):
I consume a lot of video content, both stuff that I'm very proud to talk about and stuff that I'm less proud to talk about, but I really liked the new Damon Lindelof show that's on Peacock called Mrs. Davis. So Lindelof, of course, from Lost and the new Watchmen on HBO, and Mrs. Davis is about an AI that you wear in your ear, like the HER AI and a nun that is hell-bent on the AI's destruction, and it reads like an early Coen brothers movie. It's super darkly funny and really, really thoughtful and unlike too much streaming, I think it's seven episodes, and it is a perfectly encapsulated story that has a beginning, middle, and an end and doesn't need to ever have another episode. It's amazing. Get yourself a Peacock subscription for at least a month to watch Mrs. Davis.

Lenny (01:32:56):
Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Tom Conrad (01:32:59):
There are two things about interviews. The first is I always encourage people when they're thinking about their interview questions to take any question that they're tempted to pull from their own current experience with the goal of trying to, how would this person solve this thing that I'm working through right now? Because just causing the other person to speculate and oftentimes about your own business, I think you know really well that they don't actually know anything about, it creates this imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee that feels out of sync with how I think about the collaborative nature of a great interview. So I tell people that almost every interview question should start with, "Tell me about a time in your career when..." to give them permission or to set their expectation that I'm asking them to tell me about something they've actually done that is relevant to the topic that I'm probing.

(01:33:59):
So that's just a structural thing that I try to do. And then usually towards the end of the interview, I ask almost everybody, "Imagine that you had a really great day at work. What was it that you did on that day?" Because what I'm trying to figure out is left to their own devices, what do they go to naturally because it rewards them? Because I think it's really important to find the highest best use of everyone you hire. And sometimes you can get a little bit to the bottom of what's the highest best use if you understand the things where there's a natural reward mechanism because it's like, "Well, I had this great day. I'm going to do more of that tomorrow." "What was the thing?" And it's just pretty illuminating.

Lenny (01:34:45):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Tom Conrad (01:34:49):
I have bought every pair of headphones on the planet, in part because Apple's headphones do not stay in my ears. I've sneezed one across the room, I've lost one down a drainpipe. They don't stay, none of them, the wired ones, the not wired ones, the in-ear ones, and it's left me feeling honestly like I am some kind of anatomical freak. I look at other people wearing them, I'm like, "What is going on with their ear that it's just staying there perfect?" It seems inconceivable to me. Nonetheless, I have a pair of AirPods Pro's that I want to love and put up with the fact that I'm going to drop them, lose them, sneeze them across the room.

(01:35:32):
But recently I came across this product from a company called Eartune that they're replacement tips and they just have the littlest bit of compression foam on them. They don't make the AirPods so big that they won't fit in the recharging case or anything, and they work. Miraculously, they stay in my ear. And Apple has this feature called Size Fit or something, go in settings, find your AirPods, scroll all the way down in the settings, and you can run this test where they play some audio and they tell you how good the seal is. And that revealed that my right ear is weirder than my left ear. So I actually have to use different tips in either sizes. Suddenly this sounds like a vaguely disgusting conversation that we're having. Anyway, I'm just really thrilled about my ability to wear Apple's AirPods after all these years.

Lenny (01:36:32):
I think what we're learning is you are a mutant, your ears are different. Cool. We'll link to that product in the show notes.

Tom Conrad (01:36:40):
Okay.

Lenny (01:36:41):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either in work or in life that you find useful?

Tom Conrad (01:36:48):
You can't be a product person without having an eye rolly Charles Eames quote that's at the center of your existence. And for me, the Charles Eames quote is, "The details are not the details. They make the design." And I just really absolutely believe that, that the devil is in the details when you're a product designer and be uninterested in nuance at your peril.

Lenny (01:37:14):
Final question. You worked with the creator of the GIF format. How does he pronounce, giff or jiff?

Tom Conrad (01:37:22):
Yeah. So before all of this, I worked at a company called CompuServe when I was in high school.

Lenny (01:37:29):
CompuServe, I used CompuServe. I didn't know that. That's amazing.

Tom Conrad (01:37:33):
There was a guy on the team named Steve Wilhite who invented Graphics Interchange Format, GIF, and he was a straight out of central casting, 1960s neck beard programmer type, and the first I had ever encountered and very prickly. And it's crazy, but at the time, Steve would take all comers in the fight that it was pronounced jiff. Now he's obviously wrong. It's obviously pronounced giff. It's crazy to me now 35 years later, this is still a topic that pops up on the internet every once in a while. It's somehow like Zelig, I cross paths with the guy who created Graphics Interchange Format and I know his opinion on the topic even though it's an unpopular one.

Lenny (01:38:35):
Got it. So he likes jiff, but you agree it's giff?

Tom Conrad (01:38:38):
It's definitely giff. It's obviously giff.

Lenny (01:38:40):
Okay, great. We're on the same page. We've decided. Let it be known.

Tom Conrad (01:38:44):
Let it be known.

Lenny (01:38:45):
Tom, we've talked about successes, we've talked about failures, mental health, general health, all kinds of awesome stories. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some other questions that I didn't ask, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tom Conrad (01:39:00):
I'm @tconrad on all the socials, from Twitter to Threads to Instagram. My DMs are open everywhere, and I would absolutely be delighted to hear from any of your listeners on any topic that they choose. And what can you do for me? I would love for folks to download Zero and give it a try and send me some feedback about what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong, and we'd love to have our little product be part of your life.

Lenny (01:39:32):
Awesome. Tom, thank you so much for being here.

Tom Conrad (01:39:35):

# Why AI is disrupting traditional product management | Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO)

## Transcript

Tomer Cohen (00:00:00):
When we look at the skills required to do your job, by 2030, it will change by 70%. So whether or not you're looking to change your job, your job is changing. In order to stay competitive, you actually have to go back to some first principles, go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn that fully embraces what AI unlocks.

Tomer Cohen (00:00:24):
We call it the full stack builder model. The goal itself is to empower great builders to take their idea and to take it to market, regardless of their role and the stack and which team they're on. It's really fluid interaction between human and machine.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
This feels like this could be a model for how a lot of companies operate and how product ends up being built in the future.

Tomer Cohen (00:00:42):
Change management here is going to be a critical part, but it's not enough to give them the tools. You have to build the incentives programs, the motivation, the examples to how you do it. I see a lot of companies roll out their agents and just expecting companies to adopt. It doesn't work this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
There's always been this question, is AI going to just make people that are not amazing, more amazing, or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing?

Tomer Cohen (00:01:01):
Top talent has this tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft. The key trait that I'm emphasizing for builders is...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Today, my guest is Tomer Cohen, longtime chief product officer at LinkedIn, who is piloting a new way of building that I think will become a model for how companies operate in the future. It's called the Full Stack Builder Program, and essentially the idea is to enable anyone, no matter their function, to take products from idea to launch. They've scrapped their APM program and replaced it with an associate full stack builder program. They've introduced a new career path with the title Full Stack Builder that anyone from any function can become. And as you'll hear in the conversation, they've built a bunch of internal tools and agents and processes to basically build a human plus AI product team that can move really fast, adjust to change quickly, and do a lot more with a lot less. If you're looking for inspiration for how to rethink how your team operates and to lean into what AI is unlocking for teams and companies, this episode is for you.

This episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly, and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun.

(00:03:56):
But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers. Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision, and instead show it to them. Make code-backed prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny.

(00:04:42):
Tomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tomer Cohen (00:04:45):
Thank you. It's great to be back.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:47):
It's great to have you back. I'm really excited to be chatting because you're experimenting with a very different way of building product at LinkedIn that fully embraces what AI unlocks, kind of leans into what is now possible, and to me, this feels like this could be a model for how a lot of companies operate and how product ends up being built in the future. There's a lot of product leaders that are talking about AI, what they can do. It feels like you're actually doing this in a really, really radical way, and so I'm excited to learn from you to hear about this for listeners to understand what you're seeing, what you've learned. Let me start with just why did you decide this was necessary? Why are you rethinking all of these things about how product has been built for a long time? AKA, why do people need to pay attention to what we're about to be talking about?

Tomer Cohen (00:05:34):
It really starts with kind of the basics. For me, technology has always been about empowerment. It's not about what it does for us. It's about what enables us to do. And now we have this amazing opportunity in my mind to make it about meritocracy, and I think it's an opportunity, but it's also a necessity right now, and I want to put this in context where we're entering this phase where the time constant of change is far greater than the time constant of response. Basically means that change is happening faster than we're able to respond to it. Now, LinkedIn has this unique view of the world of work. So we actually have some pretty, in my mind, mind-blowing stats to put this in perspective. When we look at the skills required to do your job, by 2030, which is literally four years from now, sounds a long time, but four years from now, it will change by 70%.

(00:06:25):
So whether or not you're looking to change your job, your job is changing. The only question is, do you keep it? And then we look at organizationally, the fastest growing jobs right now, the most in demand jobs in the market are growing by north of 70% from last year's fastest growing job. So there's a new kind of iteration of what you need as an organization to thrive. And then you apply that to building products and you realize that in order to stay competitive, you actually have to go back to some first principles, go back to the drawing board and reimagine what it means to be building. And what I love about this is when you think about the role of a builder, which the builder is at the heart of company, the goal is actually quite simple. The builder takes an ADN, she brings it to life. That's really the process, right?

(00:07:11):
And we all build those, let's call them best practices. You research the problem really well, you spec it out, you design it, you code it, you launch it, and you iterate. That's basically it. But what happens at many at scale companies, LinkedIn included and many other companies, over time that process became very complex very quickly. So what happened? We took every step and we expanded it to a lot of sub-steps. Researching, the problem became looking at for us 10 to 15 sources of information, obviously talking to customers about doing data pools, looking at feedback tickets in multiple sources, social media, interactions with customers. We probably have 10 to 15 sources of information we go for before we feel like we have research department really, really well.

(00:07:58):
Think about reviews for product. There is design reviews, privacy reviews, security reviews. I can go on and on and on. And each one of those substeps actually has a valid reason to exist. But when you add a whole thing together, you're like, "Oh my God. This is why it takes, to build a small feature, multiple teams, multiple code bases, multiple sprints just to get it out to launch," and not talk about iterating, which is actually where you seek success. You never see success in the launch itself. So really the work itself is not complex, but the process we made very complex. And when I was digging in, I found it doesn't end there because somebody has to do all those substeps, so what happened is you actually move from process complexity to organizational complexity as well.

(00:08:41):
And then you actually led to microspecialization. All those subsets are doing by somebody specific. So from one builder, we have multiple functions. Obviously we have engineering, product and design, and you can start questioning those lines. At least I am internally. And from there, we have a lot of subspecialties. It happens in every one of those functions, but imagine design. We have interaction design, animation design, content design, research. There's so many aspects to that. So they're all valid, but they all have people, and that entire process basically means a lot of... It's basically bloating. It's complexity. And then without noticing, you end up with this massively complex... We actually have this diagram that basically shows the process complexity, organizational complexity together.

(00:09:26):
And usually people are mind blown because they're working on one thing very specific, but when you zoom out, you have this overwhelming experience you're kind of thinking about. And now we have this real opportunity to collapse the stack backup, go back to craftsmanship, rethink the product development lifecycle, which is where the full stack builder model comes to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):
Wow. Okay. And there's so much here. We're going to be showing the visuals as you talk to help people see what you're explaining here. And all of this is very rational. If you have 15 sources of information, why not pull from it? Why miss out on that stuff? And what you're describing here is as you get more power and more specialized... It all makes sense rationally, but when you start to step back and look at this like, holy shit, it takes six months to launch one feature. I want to ask about the stat you shared. I think this is an incredibly powerful stat and you have very unique data here to tell you this sort of stuff. So you said that something like 70% of the skills that people will need in the future are going to change.

Tomer Cohen (00:10:28):
To do their current job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:29):
To do their current job. And what is this looking at? Is this just based on historical data or how do you find that?

Tomer Cohen (00:10:36):
Yeah. To be fair, there was always a change, right? So it was never about just keep the skills you have today, but we've never seen such a dramatic part of your role today. So whether you are a marketer right now or a seller, a recruiter, an engineer. Engineering is where a lot of the investment is going in right now in terms of agents. Those jobs will change dramatically. I remember I said my role, my life as an engineer and even then it's changed materially after 10 years, and then the change we're seeing right now, just thinking about in four years, what did it take to actually engineer really, really well would be dramatically different, or to build software, to build an artifact of some sort. But it's true for almost every function. It's not equal. Some job like nurses will see less impact, but some jobs will see 90%, 95% impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:28):
There's also a stat that I don't think you mentioned here that I saw on the post when you first talked about this program is that 70% of today's fastest growing jobs were not even on the list of jobs a year ago.

Tomer Cohen (00:11:39):
Yeah. No, so this is the fastest growing job on the list were not there a year ago, and then many of them don't even exist a decade or two ago. There's actually some pretty amazing stats across the board.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:52):
Okay. So let's talk about this program that you built. Tell us the name and then tell us the gist of what it is today and the vision of where you want it to be.

Tomer Cohen (00:12:03):
Yeah. So we call it the full stack builder model. And the goal, always start with the goal. The goal itself is to empower great builders to take their idea and to take it to market, regardless of their role and the stack and specifically which team they're on. And the idea ultimately is to be able for that builder is to develop experiences end to end, to combine skills and expertise across what was traditionally distinct domains to bring it all together. And it's not a sequence of steps. It's really a fluid interaction between human and machine. That's how the way I see it. And then when you look back at that product development life cycle from the idea, the insight all the way to launch, the key trait that I'm emphasizing for builders is where I want them to spend their time is where I think great builders should shine in.

(00:12:54):
So the idea of vision. Coming up with a compelling sense about the future. Empathy, super critical, right? Having a profound understanding of an unmet need. Communication is critical. And we see this a lot in job descriptions right now for almost every role, but ability for you to align and rally others around an idea. Creativity, which for me is about coming up with possibilities beyond the obvious. For example, I don't think AI yet is great at creativity. I think it's kind of, in many ways, brings back the things you might not know about, but it's not the kind of next level creativity, which I think still humans are much better at.

(00:13:33):
And then ultimately what I think is the most important trait for a builder is judgment. Some people call it test making, but it's making high quality decisions in what is complex ambiguous situations. Everything else, I'm working really hard to automate. Really, really hard. And then when you think about the outcome, it's not just about having more shots at the goal, which I think people go like, "Oh, the iteration speed is going to be very high." Yes, but what you're really doing to an organization of at scale organizations is they're a lot more nimble, a lot more adaptive, a lot more resilient. They can navigate the future. They can actually match the pace of change to the pace of response.

(00:14:13):
And an analogy I have in mind is kind of Navy SEALs. You come to training, they're all kind of learning, they're cross-trained, across multiple areas. What they specialize in is the mission and they operate in small pods and they're very nimble and you can assemble them very quickly. And I think that's going to be the organization that will win in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:33):
Okay. So the simple idea, if you're just to boil it down to a sentence, the idea here is there's a builder who goes through the entire product development process essentially on their own. They have an idea, they research, they do data, they prototype design ship. That's kind of like the vision of where this goes?

Tomer Cohen (00:14:50):
Yes, but it doesn't have to be on their own. It's not like... I still believe in teams.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:51):
Got it. So smaller teams.

Tomer Cohen (00:14:55):
Just smaller teams. Smaller teams and much more focused on the problem, the mission, per say, versus... Actually, one of the things we've done as an example, we started to do the idea of pods. We're no longer large teams. We assemble a team, ideally a full stack builders coming together and it's less about can I have an engineer design PM working together and trying to combine this trio looking at folks who can flex across and then they tackle something for a quarter or so and then we reassemble those two different pods. That's one example of an manifestation we're doing right now and seeing actually some great success in both in terms of velocity, but also in terms of that focus and nimbleness of that team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:37):
And it feels like the goal here, what you're trying to adjust and that broke as teams bloated as speed and adaptability and flexibility, because going back to your original point that change is happening so much more quickly now that companies that have been building in this traditional way just can't compete.

Tomer Cohen (00:15:56):
Yeah. It's not that you have to break the model. I think the model is broken. It's just this pace of change is helping us realize it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:03):
Okay. So then going back to the things that these builders still do versus what you want to automate. So the list you shared is they're responsible for the vision, empathy, communication, creativity, and judgment.

Tomer Cohen (00:16:16):
Yes. Yeah. And I would put a lot of the focus on the latter. I think if you ask me at the end of the day, what's the kind of most important trait? I would say it's that judgment, test making ability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:27):
And then in terms of what you're automating, what are some of the areas you've seen a lot of success in actually automating and where do you think this goes?

Tomer Cohen (00:16:35):
Yeah. So I think just to kind of break it to pieces, and I think this is... If you were a startup right now, in many ways you can start this way. There's no legacy code, there's no legacy structure you run. And in fact, a lot of the startups I talked to that are built AI natively, they're just working at full stack builders. That's the way they start. If you're at a company at a scale of ours and many others in the market, you're like, this is almost like a new production function and mindset that you have to do. And there's really three components that we're working on. One is platform. The second one is the tools and the agents. And lastly is the culture.

(00:17:17):
The platform one, this is the kind of level of investment you have to do before, before this actually starts, you start to see all the benefits accrue. But the platform for us as an example is rearchitecting all of our core platforms so AI can reason over it. So we're building kind of this composable UI components with server side that we actually build. We're basically building for AI to be ready to bring it in. So you can't just go and bring a third party tool and have it work on the LinkedIn stack. In fact, that's one of our biggest learnings. It never works. Never works. You have to bring it in and customize a lot of it, working almost in alpha mode with those companies to make it work internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):
So this is essentially re-architecting your code base to work more efficiently with AI. Is that one way to think about it?

Tomer Cohen (00:18:04):
Yes. And in many ways, working with those companies to adjust something in their stack to work with our stack as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):
When you say those companies, meaning the development agents like Cursors and [inaudible 00:18:16] and such?

Tomer Cohen (00:18:16):
Yes. Or Figma on design. Or you can think about design systems is another example of that. But you have to have that back and forth because they're not... In many ways, we haven't seen anybody be able to work off the shelf immediately on our code-based design systems and unique context we have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:34):
Just to follow that thread briefly, so there's Figma. That's interesting. So basically the way Figma exports and keeps your design system, that has to change to work better with AI is what I'm hearing.

Tomer Cohen (00:18:41):
They first need to know how to work with our design systems, which is something, in many ways a lot of those companies are working on. Same with coding. It doesn't work that you just bring it in and it just reasons over your code base really well. We tried. We are building that layer that basically allows it to do so, whether it's Copilot or Cursor, Windsurf and so on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Got it. Okay. Oh yeah, Copilot. Microsoft. I get it. I get it. Okay. Okay. So that's the platform. So that's an investment that you guys have to make to make AI effective at building and doing all these things.

Tomer Cohen (00:19:17):
And then you have tools. So tools is where you really build the agents. I mentioned I want to automate everything outside of those five trades that we talked about, and then we're building the tools for that. And then for that, actually very similarly, I can't just bring a tool from the outside and work. So I'll give you an example. One of our biggest things is building a trust agent. Trust is really important for us at LinkedIn. There's a lot of unique vectors which trust plays at LinkedIn doesn't place it anywhere else. So we need to bring all of that know how and context and information base into that agent. So we ended up building our own trust agent at LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
And so what is this trust agent doing? Telling you when you're maybe exposing information that you shouldn't be?

Tomer Cohen (00:19:58):
So when you build a spec, you build an idea, you walk through the trust agent and it'll basically tell you what are your vulnerabilities, what harm vectors potentially you're introducing or will be introduced as a result of that. And I had our head of trust build it. So the head of craft for every area is building their own agent. As an example, we have one of our features for job seekers is called Open to Work. If you're looking for a job, you can put an open to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:24):
Yeah, a little green loading thing on the circle.

Tomer Cohen (00:20:25):
Exactly. And actually it's a great signal. I've seen some great success from it. People are helping each other. The community really thrives around helping each other. But at the same time, it introduces a trust vector for bad actors because they're open to work. People who are looking for a job are potentially more vulnerable to scams than other folks. So being able to think about how do we prevent all of those ahead of time. So we walked that spec from a couple of years ago through the trust agent. Not only was it able to find all the stuff we initiated at the beginning, but all the holes that we did not catch until later. So that's a great example of something that actually worked really well.

(00:21:03):
That's one. The other one is a growth agent, as an example. Again, LinkedIn has a very unique... Actually, we have an incredible growth team, growth process. We've kind of funneled all of our unique loops, our funnels, our tests of the past, everything into this growth agent, and now you can basically rock your respect for it, your idea for it. And it would not just allow you to do it better. It would actually critique how good is your idea. This is something you cannot bring off the shelf. It's very unique to LinkedIn. So we had to invest dramatically in it. And one team which is using it right now, which is almost... I wasn't thinking about it at the beginning, but our UXR team, our UER team, the user research team is usually using that growth agent to understand out of all the things that are basically surfacing for members, which one has the biggest growth opportunity to have the biggest impact? That was not in the cards when we thought about that idea, but teams are basically funneling those ideas into this one.

(00:22:05):
An example is our research agent. So research agent basically is trained on the personas of our members. You can think about a small business owner, a job seeker and so on. And it's using not just world knowledge, it's using all the research we've done in the past, all the support tickets coming in. So it's pretty good at understanding that persona at LinkedIn. So one examples we had is a team came out with a spec. They weren't aware we had the research agent yet. I asked the research agent for a small business owner, wanted to think about the marketing spec we had, and it critiqued it extremely well. Actually, in many ways shifted the direction of the team to focus on other integrations tools we can focus on, but it's very hard to have that visibility all to all that corpus of knowledge inside of the company.

(00:22:56):
That's another example. We have an analyst agent trained on all how you basically can query the entire LinkedIn graph, which is enormous. And instead of relying on your SQL queries or data science teams, you can use the analyst agent. All of those I would say are, I would call them still MVP+. The goal for us in the next couple of months to basically roll them out externally. Externally, I mean, internally at LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:20):
Not as new product lines.

Tomer Cohen (00:23:22):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
Okay. So many questions. One is just how are you building this? Is there a platform you're using? What does it take to build an agent at LinkedIn? Is it all internal tools or is there third party use?

Tomer Cohen (00:23:31):
It's a great call. So I think we've been experimenting with a lot of tools. And I would say for a lot of those kind of knowledge corpus agents, we're using everything from Copilot Enterprise to ChatGPT Enterprise. By far though, the most important part was basically our own customization of it. That's been where we saw the biggest gains. Even building the orchestrator across those because you want the agents to start following to each other, the trust agent should work with the growth agent and go do a back and forth versus doing what more sequentially. So we've done a lot of work internally to make it happen. This is why I think it does require that level of investment.

(00:24:09):
And then in some cases, let's talk about the design agent that we're working with. We're working with multiple companies to try and understand which product works best for us. And interestingly enough, and this is another learning, different teams gravitate to different products. So that's something we'll have to resolve and think about how we do this really well, because ultimately we were trying to simplify the process as much as possible, but that was a big learning for us and which tools we use and how we basically integrate them in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
Got it. So you might have an amazing Figma agent, but some teams want to use a different design tool.

Tomer Cohen (00:24:44):
Yeah. So we've kind of experimented with Figma and Subframe and Magic Patterns and so on, and we saw people gravitating depending on the function, their level of visibility, their know how of the tool before, they're gravitating to different tools. And ultimately, I don't want to have eight design agents in the company, so we have to converge into at least a few. And I think it's similar across many areas because the appeal of those, a lot of those agents are trying to solve similar end goal, but they're doing it very differently. And what you'll see that ultimately, I don't think there's going to be a winner takes all because the starting point of the customer or the user will dictate a lot how simple they are for that use case.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:28):
Super interesting. The other interesting takeaway here is you're designing very specific agents that are one job to be done. Is that a very intentional decision? Did you try an agent that just is super intelligent on all these things?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:41):
Ultimately, they will do an orchestrator. We're going to really orchestrator across, but we did want to be able to rate and grade those agents really well on how they're doing. And I think there is a level of expertise. Now, we're kind of building this in a way where we'll be able to mask a lot of those. You might not know that there's a trust agent. You might have, we call this internally the product jammer agent that basically does your product jam, which is a process we do internally. You might just use the product jam engine, and that product jam agent will work with all the other agents. But now we're starting with that building blocks until we build the orchestrating layer across.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:20):
Another interesting takeaway from what you've been sharing is that so much of the work has gone into the beginning of the product development process, just like helping you craft the right requirements, clarify trust, and then here's product jam and here's the research we've done. And I imagine it's because coding has already been accelerated with all these IEE tools. Talk about just why that's maybe where most of the investment's gone and where you've seen the most impact so far.

Tomer Cohen (00:26:43):
Well, 100% our coding investment has gone, started a while back, and those are fall into place. We have our coding agent. In fact, we've kind of staged it into two parts of it. There is the idea to design part, and then let's call it the code to launch part. The code to launch part has gotten a lot of attention and we're making some big inroads there. Everything from the coding agent to what we call the maintenance agent when you have a failed build, it will do it for you. In fact, I think we're close to 50% of all those builds being done by the maintenance agent and a QA agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):
Wow. So this is when a break builds instead of engineers hopping on the issues that an agent fix.

Tomer Cohen (00:27:24):
You can still go and finish your coffee before you have to go and redo the build again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:27):
Extremely cool.

Tomer Cohen (00:27:28):
But we haven't had much investment until we kind of launched this program in the idea to design area. And that's a material part of work. It's also where the quality a lot of the work comes from, at least before you start to go into the coding phase. The idea is to empower everybody. So if you're an engineer, you can basically use all those tools at the front of the process and be able to be a full stack builder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:51):
How long did it take to get this kind of in place for you to actually form your first team to build these, the initial agents and some of this backend, redo the code base sort of thing?

Tomer Cohen (00:27:59):
I announced this internally end of last year, we really kind of started working, but it was more setting up the teams and the processes internally. We had our first MVPs of those agents I think like four to five months after it was really trained, I would say. But really the work itself has been kind of couple of months of dedicated work. A lot of it has been getting all the corpus of data together, cleaning it up. And that's actually a good learning as well. It's not great to just give it access to your drive and say, "Reason all over this knowledge base." It actually does a very poor job understanding importance of the past and putting weights on stuff. You actually want to think about specifically what the context when do you want to give it to and what's the knowledge base that you want to have it focused on. So even cleaning up, let's call them gold examples or golden examples to learn from, has been one of the biggest learnings. Just reasoning over your entire knowledge base did not work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
Yeah, that makes sense. There may be just like a researcher with a strong opinion about something that you disagree with and it wouldn't know. It's like, oh, of course, this is data, this is fact.

Tomer Cohen (00:29:03):
Exactly. And then it doesn't always understand ties to original specs to success. You have to actually build... This is a really interesting way. When you think about how you bring those tools in, you can't just bring them in. You have to know what you feed them with. And what you feed them with is not just access. I see a lot to just focus on the connectivity and integration and it reminds me of the... This is almost like, this is actually more than 10 years ago when I was co-rebuilding the team, co-rebuilding the feed at LinkedIn and we started from scratch and I had to literally sit down and filter through examples of what is a good professional post on LinkedIn and what is not. And this was like weeks of work getting up that golden sample of examples, but it wasn't... The most important part was feeding at the right data, not all the data.

(00:29:57):
So it requires work. This is where I would say for many companies who are thinking about this phase, and I do a lot of sessions today with CPOs and COs on this process. You have to put this initial work to get the gains after. When I think about it, I think there's a takeaway there in generally with AI, even if you're learning it for the first time and so on, whether it's Cursor or whether it's design, if it's Figma or other tools or Lovable, you should be ready to invest those hours before you start seeing yourself pick up in velocity and quality, which will come up, but you have to invest that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear. But a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's innovation workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes. You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's Canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:31:46):
What's the current state of the pilot? How large is it? How many teams are doing it? What kind of stuff have you shipped? Just give us a sense of today's world.

Tomer Cohen (00:31:54):
Yeah. I wouldn't say we are yet at a very high sample rate where it's kind of a high percentage of the organization, but we have a substantial part of the organization already using it to provide a lot of the feedback. We're seeing a lot of great examples. So the way I think about the benefits is a function of experimentation volume multiplied by quality. How good are those experiments divided by the time it takes to actually pull them out, like idea to launch. So on saving times, we're seeing, whether it's PMs, designers, engineers, saving hours of work a week right now, whether it's the analyst agent we talked about or the prototyping really quickly or the product jamming experience has been a big part of that. On the quality side, we're seeing insights discussions just be much, much better. And by the way, quality and time, sometimes they help each other because it's high quality, you don't have to spend as much time on something.

(00:32:52):
So we are seeing that applied in. And the volume, I wouldn't say we had a rate where I'm seeing a high percentage organization doing it yet, but this will come once we... We haven't GA'd this internally. That will come in the next couple of months once we have all the stuff in place. But we're seeing designers and PMs picking up bugs directly from Jira tickets, pushing them in, something we haven't seen before, and there's just an appetite for everybody to just join. So in fact, the biggest thing right now is everybody wants access. Everybody wants access to the tools to be able to do it together, and we just want to make sure it's good enough to make sure the whole organization can do it really well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:32):
So how is it that you're piling it? Is it some number of people have access to these agents and they just work the way they've worked with access to these tools? Or is there a team dedicated, this is the way you work now and this is it, and we'll see what happens.

Tomer Cohen (00:33:47):
So that's a great call. So basically we have a team building. It's the core team building the FSB track across all of R&D, FSB, full stack builder. And then there are pockets and pods of teams using it. So basically we are looking at specific areas that we're basically giving it to. The condition there is they give feedback. As a response for that, they make the tool better, so it's not just access. We want people who will use it. So one of your early adopters would be the ones who help [inaudible 00:34:15] up the product really well. So we're doing this in a pod model right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):
So it's like a pod within a larger team, like a designer, PM, engineer kind of group within... Is there an example? You have a part of LinkedIn that's trying this out?

Tomer Cohen (00:34:27):
Yeah. So if I think about some of our teams, whether it's... Actually, we just launched Semantic People Search and the Semantic Job Search as well. That team was using part of those tools to actually help build it. So that team actually, this was PMs building their own dashboards with those tools without waiting for design resources to come in. Then we have a design team who is now... This started really from the manager rolling this out. And in many ways, what I tell this team is, "Don't wait for the official GA. Start doing it. Start leaning in." We're seeing designers of that team starting to push PRs, which never happened before. And now other teams, they want to do this as well. So it's starting with this kind of grassroots experience. I would say the places have been very formal. I would say the beginning has been the top.

(00:35:22):
The product executive teams, basically we move from functional leaders, design, PM, BD, and so on to product areas leaders, and they basically rock across the stack and they also go for a 360 with all of those functions to see if they're really able to do a full stack building experience. Then we're also launching at the junior side a new program called the Associate Product Builder Program, where basically we used to have our APM program, which this is about it's ending this year. And then starting January, we're going to start having our APB program and they're going to come into LinkedIn. We're going to teach them how to code, design and PM at LinkedIn. They're going to go through a pretty rigorous training process, and then they're going to join those pods, and gradually we're going to grow that program to be a material part of LinkedIn as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Wow. So this might be the future of the APM program is this full stack builder APM-ish program.

Tomer Cohen (00:36:21):
In many ways, we've built some pretty amazing... I'm really excited for that group. I wish I could join it. But we build amazing training for them. And in many ways, we're going to use that training to think about how we roll it across the organization. We're kind of using the lens of you have great technical skills, but you're not an engineer at a company yet, or you have great design taste, but you haven't designed at scale in company yet, and we're going to teach you how to do it at LinkedIn, but the training we're going to use a lot to extend across the company as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:51):
Okay. So you have these programs, these pilots and these pods, and you said what you're looking at to see if this is something you roll out is experiment velocity times quality times time.

Tomer Cohen (00:37:01):
Divided by time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):
Divided by time. Okay.

Tomer Cohen (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
Got it. And I guess I know it's early, but just you said you're seeing that it's saving teams a few hours a week at this point, something like that?

Tomer Cohen (00:37:11):
Yeah. And I think the feedback has been the most important part. Right? The way to think about this is just like you build a product. So we're building this product internally and you want to experiment with some kind of early adopters who will give you feedback, and the feedback has been amazing. In fact, our top talent are the ones who are using this the most at LinkedIn. And the feedback from them has been incredible in terms because they're also willing to spend the time and give the feedback as well. And the response from them has been incredible in terms of like the quality of their output, the time they're spending on this to get the value back, their desire to be part of this and actually scale this and make this even better. So that's where a lot of the excitement has been from how they're using it and the quality we've seen there. I would say in six months or so, we'll be able to see a lot more of the organization use it and you'll start seeing those top line numbers will build as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):
That is a really interesting insight that the top performers are finding the most success, because there's always been this question, is AI going to just make people that are not amazing, more amazing, or is it going to make amazing people even more amazing? And it sounds like it's likely the latter.

Tomer Cohen (00:38:24):
Yes. And in many ways, it's surprising, it's not surprising. I've seen this also when we were... It's surprising because you want everybody else to be part of this and lean in. I think top talent has this tendency of continuously trying to get better at their craft and this innate need to be at the cutting edge of how you build, and I think we're seeing this here as well. This is why I had this phrase I say with the team that if we build all those tools, will they use it? And I know right now the answer is no. It's not enough to give them the tools to use it. You have to build the incentives programs, the motivation, the examples to how you do it. They need to see other people being successful as well.

(00:39:11):
And I've seen this also when we're shifting LinkedIn from a desktop company into a mobile company. It was a very similar process. It's very hard. Change management here is going to be a critical part. I think I see a lot of companies roll out their agents and just expecting companies to adopt. It doesn't work this way. Some will adopt. That tends to be your cutting edge 5% of talent that just wants new tools and they have a bias for change. But the vast majority needs to work for change management in how they do it, and that requires being a lot more thoughtful about the cultural aspect of it, which is by far from me the biggest and most important thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:48):
Yeah. I want to spend time there. And it makes a lot of sense why people don't spend time here because they have so much to do. They got to ship things. Their days are already busy. You have to now carve out time to learn this new tool that'll not pay off for a while. So I get why people are like, "Okay, okay, I'll get there. I'll use it someday," but they don't. This idea of culture, when I saw you share this initially, this is the third piece of making this successful. So there's the platform of getting the code base ready for people for AI to work with. Then there's the tool, like the agents you've talked about, and then there's the culture. Is there more there that you can share of just what has actually worked in helping get people on board? One thing I heard is creating a little bit of FOMO of like, okay, only a few people can use this and you have to sign up to get access. What's worked in getting people to get on board?

Tomer Cohen (00:40:39):
Yeah. I think this is where I emphasize to people that getting everything done, the platforms, the tools is not going to be sufficient. It's a prerequisite for this to work, but not sufficient for this to work because it really requires you to invest a lot in the cultural aspects of how do you get people to lean into this one. And this one might feel slow at first, but I've seen this before with our transformation of thinking from desktop to mobile. And once it picks up, it actually maintains very high velocity. One, people are really incentivized by how you define expectations for them. So to think about what is the expectation of somebody in the role, whatever-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
So like changing performance review sort of things.

Tomer Cohen (00:41:23):
Very much so. So everything from how you hire to calibration and evaluation. And one thing I want to see there early is this kind of AI agency and fluency. Like I mentioned, the tools are there. The question is, would you use them? Because the tools will be good enough, but not great at the beginning. That's the classic thing of every good MVP tool. They're good enough, but they're not great. And then you kind of want to build that agency to make the tool better. We're in this kind of notion of we're going to make this better for LinkedIn together. Two is piloting success inside of your organization. That's the pod model where you're showing that not only this could work, it's actually having success. So we have even our partnerships team, our BD team, being able to go instead of relying on waiting for an engineer to help build the developer portal and build the connectors there.

(00:42:17):
Literally one of our head of partnerships just went and did it himself. Didn't even delegate to his team. And their goal is to say like, "Hey, I can do it. You can do it as well." Those examples are really, really powerful. I talked about the associate product builder program where we are going to be very focused on training. I think that will send a really strong message across the organization. People will see this talent and what they can do, and I think that will create that movement. But celebrating wins in all hands, highlighting people and showing those examples. One example we've seen recently, people really looked at it in a surprise lens, but then it kind of, I think, really opened up a lens for them. We had somebody in our user research team. We had an opening for a PM on the growth team, and that role was open for a while, and she said that, "I think I can do it."

(00:43:11):
And she used all these tools. This is a user researcher becoming a growth PM, not usually the career path you see, but she was excited about the area. She used all those tools, and she's now a growth PM on the team. And really, you can start thinking about her more as a full stack builder ultimately. But seeing those openings and then highlighting those two people, actually people who are doing this have been a great example of it. And then just making sure that those tools are accessible. People can provide feedback, you share a lot, has been an incredible part of this. It's not enough to be top-down directive that this is how we want to work. People want to feel like there are success stories. They feel like it's worth their time. It feels it's a movement they want to be part of, and then ultimately they can see successes in how they do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
I love this kind of comparison to the shift to mobile. We all went through that and there's all these stories of companies requiring you to show mobile mocks. That's the only way we're going to operate. Now everything you have to ship has to be on mobile, and it's interesting how similar this is to them, to that experience. And so a few things you just shared here just to kind of summarize some of the things that have worked for you. Showing wins, celebrating wins, showing people what other folks are doing with AI tools, creating a program that people enroll into and make it a little bit exclusive. This performance review piece is really interesting because that really will change people's behaviors. Here's how we get promoted. Have you actually already made that change to the PM? I guess it's every track, I imagine, not just product management. Have you already made that change or is it kind of like a work in progress?

Tomer Cohen (00:44:45):
So there was two aspects to it. Once I moved my team, my directs, we did 360 for them. So their 360 was, if you came from PM, you had the designers on your team rate you. And so that had its own, and then we shared those with them, and that had its own kind of motivation. But then we broadly took it across. So when we hire right now, we look for those. And then this upcoming cycle, we do a bi-annual. That's going to be part of the performance evaluation piece and we announce it to everybody. And for what, it's where people are excited to show. And they're excited to know how they're going to be... It's always about, like, "I want to know how I'm being rated or evaluated." So just being able to show those examples has been a big part of it.

(00:45:31):
The other thing I would say, it takes time for this program and its formality to roll out across the entire organization, and I was intentionally not trying to be quick at rolling this out to everybody because I think that just dilutes the value of it really quickly because it's not about... I could care less about your title. I care about how you work. So calling you a full stack builder is not what I'm looking for. Changing your mindset to a full stack mindset is what I'm looking for. You're thinking you can do the whole thing. You're looking at those tools and looking at how to do it.

(00:46:07):
So one of the things I've said is if you're looking for a formal reorg or declaration to start building differently, you're waiting too long. Look, my biggest thing is here's a permission for me to just not wait and just go. So whether or not you have the right tools or not, go build the tool, use a tool from the outside, bring it in, show those examples. In many ways, prove that you are a full stack builder in mindset before anything else come to mind. And that just naturally will happen, and that's also where we've seen some of our best talent just goes and leans a lot into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:41):
I love that. I was going to actually mention that quote. Someone you shared, you work with told me exactly that quote you just shared, so I'm glad you brought it up of just if you're waiting for a reorg, you're not thinking about it the right way. How do you encourage people to actually play with these tools on their own? Are you just like, "Go take a few days to play with AI?" Is it just try it? Or is there anything formal you've seen of just getting people to more try this on their own without joining this program?

Tomer Cohen (00:47:05):
A lot of the tools we've made, we've been sharing them regularly. A few of my all hands have been all about how to use those tools. But then at the same time, we're kind of inviting, have you found a new tool that works really well for you? Share it, show it. Again, it could be Slack, could be Messages, Teams and so on, how you do it. But the idea is really to start getting that investment in how things work. Actually, I think in general, you can feel overwhelmed by tools right now, by recipes and how to do things like what's your prompt and what's my prompt. But really it's finding something that kind of works really well, that can gravitate around and really invest in that's been those areas. But I think we've had this invitation to go and explore and go and bring in stuff that you think are great. And in many ways, bring others along on the journey. It's one good way to make the influence much bigger than a few folks who are doing really well with this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
Are there any surprises on the negative side that have come out of this, of PRD is just feeling like AI driven, people slowing down unexpectedly? Is there anything that surprised you of just like, "Okay, this is actually not great"?

Tomer Cohen (00:48:12):
Yeah, we mentioned a few of them. I was hoping for some tools to work off the shelf really well. It was never the case because we had to invest quite a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
Never the case.

Tomer Cohen (00:48:21):
Never the case. We had to invest quite a lot. And again, part of it is we just have a lot of legacy information and code based and knowledge and designs and so on. So a lot of the companies we work with are seeing this as a great growth opportunity for them as well to invest, but I do think it's a big area of investment as well. We talked about not just giving access to all of your context which we started with, and we were like, "Oh, here's access to all the drive, all information," failed miserably and hallucinates like crazy." People gravitating towards different tools, like our goal was to converge on tools, but that was pretty hard.

(00:48:58):
And then I think in terms of quality, we've just seen better quality, but I think it's because, again, where we are in the stage is still the early adopters and they're doing a few iterations in terms of how to do it. But I would say the tooling adoption is hard. And then I think for some people, this is important for me to kind of state, some people do not want to be full-stack builders, and that's completely okay. Some people see themselves in specialization, and I think specialization has a place and a role. So I didn't want the message to be across the organization I expect everybody to be a full-stack builder. I do not. I think there are system builders that empower full-stack builders, and then you have people who are specialized. But I don't think we need as many specialized people as we did in the past.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:46):
I didn't actually realize this until just now. So is this their title now instead of product manager engineer, they're full stack builder?

Tomer Cohen (00:49:52):
We have a full stack builder title formally inside the organization, and we are gradually putting people in that bucket.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:59):
So there's a whole career ladder that's forming. There's a whole... Okay. That's a bigger deal than I even thought. So where are you finding these folks mostly coming from, like product, engineering, design? I imagine it's a mix, but just is there a most common trend?

Tomer Cohen (00:50:13):
It's a mix. People listening, I would just think about just go over your org and imagine who can do it, who can right now flex across those functions, whether it is engineering, design, product, even BD, and what you'll find is there's already quite a few that can flex across.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
Interesting. Are there any functions you think are especially successful at this? Not to play any favorites, but I don't know. Are you finding like, okay? Or you could also not highlight any specific.

Tomer Cohen (00:50:45):
No, I think it's a mental model of how you do it. I think if I were to play what's the hardest craft to potentially learn, I think design has a lot more work to get the design agents to be really, really good. So I think designers have a little bit of a leg up in terms of others learning their craft than the vice versa. But I honestly think it's a mindset. I've seen designers code, I've seen PMs kind of design and do well. And this is why I think when you kind of step back and you think about people in your organization and who can flex, I think you'll see them show up in many areas. And what I think you'll find there is they have the agency, they're leaning into new things, they have the fluency, like they're already building new experiences and they have that growth mindset that they just want to get better, so it doesn't matter what they learn at school or what label somebody put in them when they join the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:44):
What I love about a lot of this is it's the easiest time to transition between different product roles than it's ever been. Design's moving to PM, and sure, or just moving to this new role, it makes it so much easier to, like you said, that researcher became a growth PM.

Tomer Cohen (00:51:58):
And this is probably my biggest advice slash motivation I give to the team because what I tell them is ultimately... By the way, this is for me as well. I think about it the same way. The incentives for you are so aligned with your organization of what we're asking for, right? Because we need you to change. We want to be a more agile, adaptive, resilient organization that can deal with the pace of change, but you want as well for your own career. You want to be at the cutting edge of how you build. So the incentives are really aligned between what you need for your own career and what the organization needs you to do. So there's that permission to go and do it for me is ideally kind of a tailwind in what they want to do more than anything else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:46):
Maybe a last question for people that are inspired and like, "Okay, this is what we need to be doing," any just tips for someone starting down this road to be successful at trying something like this at their company?

Tomer Cohen (00:52:58):
I would say I would start with the notion of how do you want to bring this just structure. I would think about the platform you need to build, the tools you want to bring, and then I would spend a lot of time on the culture. Platform and tools I think would be, again, a prerequisite, but not sufficient, and the cultural aspect is really important. I would think a lot about how you bring people along. So for one of the learnings we had that probably able to do it differently right now, if I were to redo this program was, for a while I was working very closely with my core team on it, the core kind of full stack building team that were in charge of building all this material, but the organization was always asking questions. "What's going on? Who is doing it? What are the tools?" And in retrospect, we could have done a lot more in the flow to just show them and get them to already use early tools or be aware of it versus doing a small team on the side.

(00:53:49):
So it's okay to start with a small team. I think it's really important. But at the same time, just making sure there's visibility across the whole thing is really powerful. Being patient and being willing to invest. I always give this example of, we always give this example of like, "Oh, look at this startup. They built this in a week." Yes, you can build lifestyle in a week right now if you start from scratch. It's actually not hard. But when you are trying to transform a large organization, you want to have this impatient about the goal and you have to have a high ambition, but being very thoughtful and patient about how you bring it to life and the key things you have to invest in. If you don't invest in your platform, I just don't see how this could be a successful outcome. If you don't invest in customizing the tools for you, then you're just going to get vanilla generic agents from the outside.

(00:54:39):
So being aware of the investment and making sure you actually allocate resource to it, this is kind of the classic, be willing to invest upfront so you can reap the benefit after, versus saying, "Hey, why am I not seeing us moving into 2X the productivity in a week?" That's not going to be this way. You can see it with some people, but starting to collect those examples and starting to really think about the transformation is really key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
This is so incredibly cool. I know that a lot of CPOs and heads of product and all kinds of leaders are reaching out to you trying to figure out what you've learned how to do this. So I love that we went deep on all these things. Just final question, is there anything else that we haven't shared that you think might be helpful for listeners to hear or maybe just to double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Tomer Cohen (00:55:26):
Whether you're in an organization, you're waiting for your leader to roll this out or you're a leader trying to roll this out, I would not wait. The first thing I've done, which I thought in retrospect was very hopeful is I did announce this upfront we are going to this mode. We're starting in pockets, we're starting in pods, we're building the tools, but this is the mountain we're going to go after, and in many ways, we're going to make it great. I also announced that this is not just an end state, it's a kind of continuous progress. There's no state we're going to get to as much as continuously just trying to be better. And in many ways, to compete, you just want to be better than others in how you build because the version of building will completely just transform itself every few years or so.

(00:56:13):
So do not wait. Really focus on the progress you're making, over communicate with your team, not just the vision, but also the progress you're making, almost like holding yourself responsible. If you're a leader, give yourself KPIs you share with your own teams or OKRs. And if you're inside of the organization, and I would say whether or not or not your CPO or your CEO is announcing this type of program, go do it or join an organization that does it so you can be at the cutting edge of how you build in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):
Tomer, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Tomer Cohen (00:56:48):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
First question, what are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Tomer Cohen (00:56:54):
I love to give trios of books that I really like. So my current trio is, they're very diverse in topics, so apologies if it's not falling all into tech. But the first one is called Why Nations Fail. It's a book I read a decade ago even more and the authors of it just won the Nobel Prize last year. And it basically talks about why does some nations succeed and some fail? And it's not the usual explanations we go for, which is, oh, it's culture, it's natural resources, it's the kind of religion. A lot of those tends to be the kind of immediate excuses people have. It kind of falls into two camps. Are there extractive or inclusive institutions? Can people participate broadly and opportunities shared or there are institutions that basically are supposed to be attracting from many and give to some.

(00:57:48):
So it's just an incredible way to just think about how you build a nation. And for us at LinkedIn, we think a lot about the idea of opportunities, so how you build a product as well. And it's just a good way to move away from easy explanations into what really makes a country really successful as well. Second book, it's called Outlive. It's really about the idea, it's kind of like the author, Peter Attia talks about the idea of medicine 3.0, which is really the notion of building personalized medicine, which I think in the world of AI will become incredible in the future. But it's all those, let's call those categories that you should think about for your life so you can just optimize your health as much as possible and goes for everything through fitness to diet to the biggest health factors you should think about. But it's a great long book. Then lastly-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
The one in my bookshelf behind me.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:42):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:43):
It's up top. You can't actually see it, I think.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:47):
And then lastly, it's a book that also came out many years ago, but it's called The Beginning of Infinity, which I really like, by Deutsche. It wasn't an easy read for me, but I love the idea. In fact, especially in products, I love the idea of cause and effect, like really finding great explanations for why things happen and then building on top of that your next iterations. And this book really pushes on the idea of explanations that only once we have a clear understanding of what things happens, then we can have breakthroughs on top of that. But until we get to a point of clear scientific breakthroughs, we are not going to make significant progress. But when you do that, it's really almost like infinite progress you can make on top of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
Naval's always talking about that last book. I think I bought it and it was just hard reading this.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:39):
It's not an easy read, at least for me. It wasn't an easy read, but it's a very powerful read.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Awesome. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Tomer Cohen (00:59:46):
Can I do a podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):
Absolutely.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:50):
So there's a podcast in, it's in Hebrew, it's called One Song, and it takes a song that generally is ideally popular and then goes really deep on the origin and the history of the song, and I love it. I love music and just dissects songs so well. It does a great job also in bringing to life the story behind it. So for me, it just goes back to you thought the song was about something, but then it goes really deep into the actors behind the song, and sometimes it's the words chosen or it's how the lyrics match the music itself, and I just really enjoy that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:30):
There's a podcast called Song Exploder, I believe, that is a similar concept that's not in Hebrew, in English, that I'll point people to if you love that one.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:39):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be a kitchen gadget, type gadget.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:48):
Can it can be a product I want to have, which I think is actually really easy to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
I love that. This is a product thinking 101 and just the vision of what you want to see.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:58):
So in my car right now, there's Alexa built-in, which is great because the kids can ask for songs all day long and it's a whole show inside of the car. But one of my favorite things to do when this has been doing it for well over two years is I go in and I go into voice mode.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:17):
ChatGPT.

Tomer Cohen (01:01:18):
Yeah, ChatGPT, and then just have a conversation, and that's just friction. I would love to have on my steering wheel a button that invokes my AI friend that can sit next to me in the passenger seat, and I just think that would be such a... I actually think it would [inaudible 01:01:36] rides for people. Just that movement, that's just like elimination of friction will transform the experience for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:43):
On that note, I recently discovered Teslas actually do this now. If you hold the right wheel, Grok appears and you could talk to Grok. So it's here. The AI has arrived. Yeah. I just did it by accident and then it's, "Okay, cool."

Tomer Cohen (01:02:01):
Great. So for me, if anybody from Rivian is listening, please bring this in the car.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:06):
Rivian's falling behind. Yeah. And you have to use Grok. It'd be cool if you could switch to different AIs because it has a personality. Just give me information. I don't need you to laugh and give me jokes.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:20):
Did you need to spend some time with it before or did it have any memory from... Did you bring any memory into it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
There's a logged out version and then you could just log in and it connects to your account. Yeah, it's extremely cool. No one's talking about it. It's crazy because I don't know if they launched it fully, but it just appeared.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:38):
Do you talk in the car a lot to it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
I don't use it that much, to be honest, but I should. My wife just doesn't love Grok. I think the brand of Grok is a specific brand. And so she's like, "Don't talk to Grok in here with me."

Tomer Cohen (01:02:52):
I love voice mode, so I use it all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:55):
Yeah, I love voice mode too. It just interrupts too often. That's the issue there, right? It's just it stops.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:59):
By the way, you can set it up. You can basically say like, "Hey, just let me finish."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:03):
I now know that. I'm learning so much. Okay. Two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often find useful in work or in life?

Tomer Cohen (01:03:11):
I think last time I talked about it, I most associated here with, I might be wrong, but I'm not confused, although I don't say it as much anymore. But I think the one I love, growth mindset is a second religions for us at home. And one thing I love about, there's a phrase there that is becoming is better than being, which I think ties into the FSB mode a little bit, which is you're always in progress mode, iteration mode. It's not about reaching a state. It's about the journey, the process. That's what you should fall in love with. It's about continuously growing and evolving without the negativity of it or there's no sense of FOMO there. It's just this continuous thing. If I look back a year from now and I look back, how much did I grow? How much do I know? What skills to do that again? Where are I becoming better? Do I feel like Tomer version 2026 versus 2025? What's the delta there? And I kind of love that as a way of thinking.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
A great segue to our final question. By the time this episode comes out, it won't be a secret that you're leaving LinkedIn after 14 years. Legendary run. You joined way before the acquisition, you helped them integrate. Just like the way LinkedIn was perceived 14 years ago is so radically different from the way it is today. It's actually really fun and interesting to be there versus how people for a long time felt about LinkedIn. So I guess the question just how you feeling and what's next? I imagine you're going to get a lot of calls from a lot of people, but what are you planning?

Tomer Cohen (01:04:48):
Yeah, so I feel proud. It's been an incredible ride at LinkedIn. The way I've got to know about LinkedIn deeply the very first time was when I moved to the Valley and I went to a lecture at Stanford about social networks in 2008 and Reid was there and he talked about the power of being a professional communities online, and I was very nerdy about it and thought it was incredible vision, had no plans to join and actually started my own company after. But as luck would have it, found myself joining a few years after and just thought the mission was incredible. So in many ways it aligned with my purpose and just was an incredible ride to be here.

(01:05:32):
And I also feel very grateful. I shared this with the company recently. I was starting to take learnings from my experiences here. A lot of it was from tough situations. We had a lot of tough situations at LinkedIn and hard calls and late nights, but you learn so much from those and I'm just incredibly grateful. And I'm excited. I'm excited. I have a bias for change. I have a bias for kind of positioning myself in a place where I can learn the most and learn a lot. And it's an incredible time to build, so I'm just excited to be thinking of new problem sets and new areas where I can go deep on and invest the next decade in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
I think it's going to take a long time for you to not feel like you're working on LinkedIn and to forget about all the things that you have been worrying about for so many years.

Tomer Cohen (01:06:20):
After you build something for such a long time, and I think you and I talked about it at one point, that I think one of the best traits for a builder is to become very passionate with what they're building. Really care. Not about the job. It's really care about the product. When you feel the pain when somebody complains and you kind of have this continuous discontent, and it's like for me, it's the notion of raising a baby. So yeah, it's hard. It will be hard. I will always think of LinkedIn as one of the babies I helped grow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):
Well, I'm excited to have you back someday when you figure out what you want to do next and or start whatever you're doing. I love that this was an excuse to get to know you. Tomer, thank you so much for being here.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:03):
It was great to be here. Thanks, Lenny.

# A founder’s guide to crisis management | Uri Levine (Waze co-founder, serial entrepreneur)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've co-founded 10 different companies. You've been on the board of 20. You've also built two unicorns including Waze. The biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to-

Uri Levine (00:00:09):
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Anything you wanted to share around hiring and firing?

Uri Levine (00:00:23):
Every time that you hire someone new, mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, knowing what I know today, would I hire this person? If the answer is no, fire them immediately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Let's actually talk about fundraising.

Uri Levine (00:00:37):
Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation is the first slide. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point. Now the second most important slide is the last one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze and nine other companies. He sold two companies for over a billion dollars. He's also been on 20 different startup boards, including a dozen he's still currently on. He's also advised over 50 founders and startups over his career. More recently, he wrote a book that summarizes all of his advice for founders called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, A Handbook for Entrepreneurs. In the foreword to the book, Steve Wozniak said, "This book will change your life and become your Bible if you are an entrepreneur," and I cannot disagree with that. This book is very tactical with amazing stories and walks you through the ideation phase all the way to exiting your company.

(00:01:39):
In my conversation with Uri, we chat about many of my favorite chapters, including why falling in love with the problem is so important, how to find product market fit, a really clever tactic for firing people who aren't a fit for your company, a ton of really genius tactical advice for improving your fundraising pitch and so much more. With that, I bring you Uri Levine, and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Uri, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Uri Levine (00:02:17):
Thank you. Happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:18):
Okay, so here's what I've gathered about your career, and let me know if I've missed anything. You've co-founded 10 different companies, including four you're still operating. You've been on the board of 20 companies. You've advised 50, maybe more, companies. You've also built two unicorns, including Waze, which you sold for over a billion dollars, which back then was an astronomical amount of money. It still is. So does that all sound right? Is there anything big I missed about your career?

Uri Levine (00:02:48):
That sounds about right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
I think what's really interesting to me is that from all of that experience, the biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to fall in love with the problem. It's what your book is called. You have a T-shirt that you're wearing right now that you wear on every podcast that says that exactly. Clearly this lesson has struck a big chord with you. I'm curious if there's a moment where you realize that that's the core and that's something that every founder needs to get right. Is there an aha moment or is it kind of this progressive like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is the secret."

Uri Levine (00:03:19):
I'm not sure that this is a certain moment. I think that that was evolving over time and realizing that, look, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurship journey is about value creation. The simplest way to create value is solve a problem. That's the simplest way. And in my background, I'm an engineer always looking for the simplest way, and solve a problem is the simplest way, and so this is where fall in love with the problem coming from, and people occasionally would confuse the T-shirt with the book, and now the T-shirt is about 10 or even more years old and the book is only two years old, and so I was wearing those T-shirts for a long while before I wrote the book and when I wrote the book that was obvious that this is going to be the name of the book, but they are way more into that, right?

(00:04:06):
So when you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful. But also the story that you are about to tell is way more compelling. Just imagine that we will be here in 2007, just before I started Waze, and I will tell you I'm going to build an AI crowd-source based navigation system and you're going to say, "Oh, yeah, very interesting," but you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care, and when your customer cares, they want you to be successful, and when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.

(00:04:56):
And so in that sense, fall in love with the problem is really a key to increase the likelihood of being successful. So in general, all of my startups start with a problem. Think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a better place if you solve that and then ask yourself, so who has this problem? If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution. If you follow this path and your solution works, it's guaranteed that you're creating value.

(00:05:47):
If you start with a solution, you might be building something that no one cares and that's really frustrating. So fall in love with the problem. This is where you want to start. Now this is really hard because I am getting tons of emails every week from entrepreneurs and they all start with what we are doing and I don't really care what you're doing. What I really care about is why you are doing that, and this is the problem that you solve or the value that you create or the value that you create for me. This is what really matters, right? And so if you start your story with, "Our company is," or, "Our system is," and in the recent year everything is, "Our AI system is," or, "Our AI company is." But generally speaking, if you start your story with that, you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with, "The problem we are solving is," Then you focus on the problem. If your story start with, "The value that we create for you is," then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution.

I've been a super happy customer of Mercury for over a year now and it's honestly hard to imagine a better online banking experience can exist.

Mercury knows that there's an art to simplifying this complex patchwork. With new bill pay and accounting capabilities, you can pay bills faster, stay in control of company spend and speed up reconciliation. The end result is the precision control and focus that startups need to transform how they operate.

(00:09:02):
I want to follow a couple threads here because I imagine there's certain problems people fall in love with. "Amazing. I want to solve this very obscure problem for my family or a friend of mine," and then they realize this is never going to be a huge venture scale business, if that's a goal of theirs. You talked about like, make sure enough people have this problem versus just getting a therapist that's going to help you with this problem. What are some signals and heuristics folks can use to help them understand this is a big enough problem that it's really worth their time?

Uri Levine (00:09:30):
So people ask me, "So you send me to speak with users. How many?" And I will tell them a hundred. You don't need a hundred, but the hundred basically say you need to get out of your comfort zone. It's not just your close friends and family that you need to discuss that. You need to discuss that with people that you don't know. And usually what happen is, and the validation is in most cases is really clear, right? If you tell someone, "This is the problem I'm going to address," and they will tell you, "Oh, I know someone that has this problem," it's not a real problem. If they will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no. This is not the problem. The problem is," and they will give you their description of the problem. This is something that you really want to follow. So if you speak with a hundred people, but if you actually speak with 20 people that you don't know, you will get validated whether or not this problem is real or not.

(00:10:23):
And look, it's not the only way to become successful, right? You look at one of the most successful products in the world, the iPhone, right? And you ask yourself, what was exactly the problem when they started? And the answer is that there was no problem when they started. There were smartphones and people were actually very happy with them. And so occasionally we need to invent something completely new, but solving a problem is simply the simplest way to create value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):
Another element of picking a problem to work on, so you say you fall in love with a problem. Is being excited to work on this problem. There's oftentimes problems you find that aren't that exciting to you or you're not excited to work on real estate software, but you find there's a big problem. How important is it that you're personally passionate and excited to work on this thing versus like, "Oh, wow. This is a huge business opportunity. I got to go after it. It doesn't matter if I'm not that passionate about it."

Uri Levine (00:11:20):
Fall in love, right? This is really passionate. Really, really passionate. Look, the journey is really hard and complex and long and so you have to be in love in order to go into this journey because otherwise it's not going to be successful. You really want to be passionate. If you're not passionate about the problem, even though that the problem might be real and big and significant, there is not enough drive, there is not enough internal drive to take you through the hardship of the journey, and so you need to be passionate. You need to fall in love. You personally need to fall in love with the problem. And then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:05):
Is there an example of a pivot that you maybe went through where you realized the problem was not as big as you thought or you realized there's a bigger problem?

Uri Levine (00:12:13):
So actually there are many, right? So Oversee deals with maybe biggest secret in travel industry. What happened to airfare after you booked your flight? Now you have no idea because you never compare prices after you met the reservation. But you know that airfare is going up and down all the time. It's going up and down before you are making the reservation and keep on going up and down after you're making the reservation. So if this is the price that you paid and this is cancellation fees, if the price drops here, you can rebook the same flight at the cheaper price.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:48):
Genius.

Uri Levine (00:12:49):
If you would only keep on comparing prices after that, right? So we started this company that is actually monitoring your own itinerary and we realized that this is going to be huge benefits to travelers and we started that as a B2C company, direct to consumers, and we realized that even though the people really care, they are not willing to take the action that is required, and we ended up with doing that for corporates, and in corporates there are very simple ways for them to engage that automatically, so automatic rebooking and so forth, and we can save corporates about 10% of the travel budget that goes directly to bottom line. So we started that as a B2C and then we realized that this is way harder than we think it is, and we ended up with converting that into B2B, which turns out to be very successful for us. And so occasionally there are companies that you start your journey with one perception and you change that and that will happen multiple times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
That's an awesome example. I want to, before I move on to, I'm kind of thinking about this in the phases of starting a company. So we're talking right now about coming up with the idea that you want to commit to. A lot of people that want to start companies are not sure how to find a great idea, so the core advice you're sharing is find something, find a problem, and fall in love with solving that problem in whatever way you can. Do you have any other advice for helping somebody find a problem and finding a startup idea? Where do you find startup ideas? What do you find? What does work for you mostly?

Uri Levine (00:14:30):
So for me, it's usually personal frustration that leads me to start to think about it, whether or not we can change it. I hate traffic jams, right? I hate leaving money on the table, right? So there are many things that I ran into and I get frustrated and I tell myself, "No, no, no. There must be a different way to do that." But in general, look, the problem itself needs to start from you, right? Something that really bothers you, something that you care about, and then it's the validations of the problem that you speak with many people, try to realize. Now if you'll tell me, oh, this is a B2B, then speak with many businesses, right? Speak with those that you believe actually do have this problem and I understand their perception.

(00:15:13):
Once you validate that, then there are few things that you need to realize. One is about the journey itself. This is going to be a multi-dimensional journey. It's going to be at least three dimensions and maybe fourth, right? So the three dimensions, one of them is it's going to be a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs. And look, if you'll tell me that all the businesses in the world have ups and downs, I agree, but the frequency of those when you are building a startup? Way higher. I think that I heard the best quote on that from Ben Horowitz, Ben Horowitz from Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, and before that he used to be a CEO of a startup and he was asked whether or not he was sleeping well at night and he said, "Oh, yeah, I slept like a baby. I woke up every two hours and cried." And that's really the reality of that. The frequency of the differences are so dramatic that there is nothing compared to that, a roller coaster journey.

(00:16:17):
It's also a journey of failures. Look, we are trying to build something new that no one did before, and even though that we think that we know exactly what we are doing, we don't. So we try. We try one thing and it doesn't work. We try another thing and it doesn't work. Or if we keep on trying different things until we find one thing that does work. Now, if you realize that this is going to be a journey of failures, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that if you're afraid to fail, then in reality you already failed because you are not going to try. Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed, that because you haven't tried new things before. If you're going to try new things, you will fail. Michael Jordan used to say that, "I've failed over and over and over and over again and this is what made me successful." And so this is the first conclusion.

(00:17:07):
The second conclusion is that you really want to fail fast. Just think about it, right? If you fail fast, you still have plenty of time to try another attempt and build another version of the product. Try another go-to-market approach. Try a different business model so you still have plenty of time to make more and more and more attempts, and the more attempts that you have, you simply increase the likelihood of being successful. Just think that you play basketball, right, and you try to score from half court. If you have one shot and you are not Steph Curry, you are very likely to miss. But if you actually have a lot of shots, one of them you're going to make. That's it. Just think about it. The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect. You don't need to be perfect. You need to be good enough in order to win the market, and the way that you are going to become good enough, by the way, is really simple. You start with not good enough and you iterate and iterate and iterate until you become good enough and then you'll win.

(00:18:10):
The third dimension is that this is going to be long journey. Very long. Way longer than you think it is. And the longest part of it is until you figure out product market fit, and product market fit goes into the different phases of building a company. To a certain extent, I would say, look, the difference between a corporate and a startup is that a corporate knows this is our value proposition, this is the product that we are selling, this is the pricing of this product that we are selling, this is the target audience, this is how we are going to sell them, this is how we going to the market, and all we have to do is keep on executing and hopefully nothing will change over the period of time. When you start as a startup, you don't have a product. You don't know what's the business model. You don't know what people are going to pay you for. You don't know how to grow your business, and you need to figure out all of those, and this is going to be a long journey.

(00:19:11):
Now, the longest part is usually figuring out product market fit and product market fit is really simple. That means that you create value to your customers. If you do not figure out product market fit, you will die. As simple as that. You never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died. That's it. Now, once they do, and for a second I want you to think of, with all the applications that you're using every day, right? From searching Google, using Waze, WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, whatever it is, and ask yourself what is the difference between any of those today and the first time that you have used that? And the answer is that there is no difference. We are searching Google today the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life. We're using Waze today the same way that we used Waze for the first time in their life. So once a company figure out product market fit, they don't change their product anymore because this is the value that they created to the customers and you don't want to change that.

(00:20:14):
What we don't know is how long did it take them to get to this point, right? Beforehand we never heard of them and after that they don't change that anymore. It's a matter of years. For Waze, it was four years. For Microsoft, it was five years. For Netflix, it was 10 years. Now if you'll tell me, "Oh, today is very different. ChatGPT just started a year ago." No, they're seven years old. It took them six years until you heard about them for the first time in your life. So it does take time to create value and this is something that is really significant. Now, at the end of the day, product market fit have one metric. One metric. That's it. Retention. That's really simple. If you create value, they will come back. If they're not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. Now think about your episodes, right, of this podcast, right? Most of your listeners are returning, right? Because you create value for them and they are coming back. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
100%. Every single one, every episode.

Uri Levine (00:21:29):
Occasionally there are new one, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):
And there's new ones coming in all the time.

Uri Levine (00:21:32):
[inaudible 00:21:32]. By the way, this is one thing that some businesses don't realize, whether or not their customers are going to be new customers or returning customers, and in many cases they simply fail to realize that upfront and the result is that they are not building the right go-to-market strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
We covered a lot of ground there. That was amazing. I'm going to follow a number of threads of things you just touched on. You talked about product market fit briefly. What was the moment you felt product market fit with Waze? I don't know if I've ever heard that story.

Uri Levine (00:22:09):
We started in Israel and Israel is a small place and we ended up with being very successful in Israel and then we said, "Wait a minute. Waze crowdsource all the data, right?" Not just the traffic information and speed cams and so forth, but also the map data itself, so we can start from a blank page. And the users while they drive, they create the map and they create traffic information and so forth. And so we figure out that we can start anywhere and we made Waze global at the end of 2009 and we expect that to work the same way that it did in Israel, but it didn't. It was not good enough. It was not good enough in the U.S. It was not good enough in Western Europe. It was not good enough in Latin America, it was not good enough in Asia. It was not good enough anywhere that matters, right?

(00:22:57):
It was actually good enough in about four places. In the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Latvia and Ecuador, and that's about it. Rest of the world not good enough. So what we did is we spoke with the drivers. Look, they wanted us to be successful. We basically said the drivers are going to fight traffic jams together, so common enemy, togetherness, all goodness. Everyone wanted that to work, right? So people downloaded the app and it simply was not good enough. So they churned, right, because if it's not good enough, you're not coming back. We spoke with them. We asked them what didn't work for them. They told us because they wanted it to work, and we built the next version addressing everything that they've told us, and we know that this is it, and it's not. So we doing it all over again. We speak with the drivers. We ask them what didn't work for them, they tell us. Now we build the next version and now we have the conviction that it's going to work and it's not. Journey of failures.

(00:23:58):
Iteration after iteration after iteration after iteration. More than a year of iterations until beginning of 2011 that we actually started to see that working, and then it's in multiple places. In the U.S., one metropolitan after the other, right? Los Angeles first and then San Francisco and then Washington D.C. and Chicago and New York and Atlanta and so forth. In Europe, one country after the other. Italy first and then France and Netherlands and Sweden and Spain and one country after the other. In Latin America, one country after the other. Colombia first and then Chile and then Brazil and then Mexico and then rest of Latin America. In Asia, multiple countries one after the other. Not all of them, by the way. Not all of them. Japan is a very good example where it didn't work and it will never work. Waze crowdsourced the information, right? Which basically says that as soon as we get to the level of good enough, then we are good enough.

(00:25:01):
House numbering plan. In the U.S., it's really simple, right? Every block is a hundreth numbers, right? And so if I have the map, I can actually count the number of blocks and take you to approximate the right location even if I don't have exactly all the house numbers there. Most of the western world, it's a geographical order. So in Israel, this is going to be sequential order, odd number on one side of the street, even number on the other side of the street starting from one until the end of the street and so forth, so it's enough that I will have few house numbers that I can actually take you to the right place.

(00:25:38):
In the UK, house number starts on one side off the street and then on the other side they are coming back, right? And so there is an order. In Japan, it's chronological order. The oldest house in the neighborhood is house number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Oh, wow.

Uri Levine (00:25:56):
And then the house number two can be miles away, but it's the second oldest house in the neighborhood and so you have to have all the house numbers unless... Until then you are not good enough. And crowdsource is, if you need perfect information, crowdsource may not be the right way to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
Just to close the loop on this question, when you were launching these markets and it wasn't working, were you actually looking at retention at that point, and if so, was there a number you were looking for? Or was it more qualitative like it's just taken off off into the right. Like where were you actually watching back in the early days?

Uri Levine (00:26:32):
That was easier for us because we tried to compare everything to Israel, so we looked at the frequency of use or when our people are coming back. How long does it take them until the next try and until the next try. And in generally speaking, if you look at something that have high frequency of use, then you will be looking at three-month retentions of 30, 40, 50% is actually pretty good indication. But usually what would happen is that you would know when they convert and that's going to be after the third or the fourth time, and if they're not getting to the fourth time, then they are basically saying, "Okay. We gave it a try. We really like this story. We gave it another try, and it's not good enough."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):
That's a cool heuristic. Do you find that that is useful for other startups, consumer-type startups or is that just something you think specific to Waze at that point, this idea of coming back for the third time?

Uri Levine (00:27:29):
It's really depending on the frequency of use, right? If I will tell you that I have a startup that helps you to file your tax returns in three minutes, then okay, that's absolutely amazing, but you are only going to do that, next time is next year. By the way, we did have a startup that was doing that. It's still a little bit up and running, but that was really frustrating because the tax authority shut us down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):
You got to fall in with the problem. You got to power through that. Just change the government. Just kidding. The story you told of Waze and iterating is a really good example of falling in love with the problem. You're really passionate about. I want to solve traffic, I hate traffic. By the way, what it made me think about a little bit is Elon, when he hated traffic, he built the boring company and built tunnels underground, and your solution to hate traffic is I'm going to build Waze in a soft wrap.

Uri Levine (00:28:29):
We start Waze with the vision that we are going to help people to avoid traffic jams. Now the reality is that there are more traffic jams today than there were in 2007. Obviously, number one, I'm not done. And number two, if you ask people what is the value of Waze, then it's not about avoiding traffic. It's about creating certainty and certainty is way higher value than saving time. So you know exactly when you're going to get there and this is a way higher value. And by the way, we learned that in the U.S. market when we spoke with people. They told us, "If I am living in Cupertino and I need to drive up to San Francisco and I can take 101 or 280, I don't really want to change my route unless there is something dramatic, but what I really want to know is how long it's going to take me. So I'm going to stay on the 101. I'm not going to get into service road. I'm not going to take El Camino Real. I'm not going to try something else. I'm going to stay on the 101. Just let me know how long it's going to take." So certainty creates way more value than saving time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
I want to talk through a couple other of the chapters in your book. So chapter four is around the different phases of a startup journey and your core advice is that it's important to focus on one thing at a time in each of these phases, and the first phase, you call it the all over the place phase, I think, or yeah, the all over phase, and the idea is you need to get out of that as soon as you can and then focus. Can you just kind of talk through these different phases and what you think people do wrong along the phases? Maybe they get them wrong or they focus on the wrong things in each phase.

Uri Levine (00:30:17):
So initially you think about your new idea from multiple perspective, right? This is the problem. This is how this solution is going to look like. This is what I'm going to do next year. This is my 10 years vision. This is my business model and so forth. So you think about everything, but you actually need to execute only one thing. Now this one thing is figuring out product market fit. It's not one thing, right? Wait a minute. You also need to build an organization and you want that organization to be something that you really like and so there are a lot of operational stuff, but you need to figure out product market fit. As we said earlier, if you don't figure out product market fit, you will die. If you do, then you get to live and die another day and the other day is whether or not you're going to figure out how to grow your business and whether or not you're going to figure out your business model.

(00:31:11):
Now the good news is that I will tell you that if you create value, you will figure out a business model, at least for the people that you create value for them. They are most likely willing to pay. Now in general, I'm not saying that this is the only business model that is viable, but if you create value, you will figure out a business model. But figuring out a business model is a journey by itself, and guess what? It's going to be a long roller coaster journey of failures. When we started Waze, we thought that we're going to sell map data and traffic information and we ended up with doing advertisement. Very different business model. Because we realized that it's not for us. It's too long sales cycles. We were very mobile internet dynamic company and selling to government is not exactly what we wanted to do, and so we ended up with a different business model, but with a lot of reasoning why this is the right business model for us.

(00:32:14):
And figuring out growth, look, if I would ask a hundred people on the street, how did you hear about Waze? They, 95 of them, if not 99 of them, will tell me, "Someone told me." Word-of-mouth, right? So everyone wants to have word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth you can only have if you have high frequency of use. If you're doing tax returns once a year, even if you really like the experience, then once a year you're going to tell someone else. If you're using Waze every day, then every day you have an opportunity to tell someone else. So word-of-mouth, even though that everyone would like that, it's only going to happen if you have high frequency of use.

(00:33:01):
So those phases requires different focus of the company, right? Initially if you focus on product market fit, then you don't need sales. You have no product to sell. You don't need business development. You don't need even marketing. You need product. You need developers and you need product lead to define the product and lead through the iterations of the product until we get to the level that it's good enough. Once you get there, you shift gears. If the product doesn't change, if we search Google the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life, then the product development is now not going to be focused about value creation. It's going to be focused about either figuring out business model or figuring out scale, and the entire company shift gears and move to a different phase.

(00:33:54):
Now, this is really hard. Just think about it. If up until now the product development group was the only things that matters, all of a sudden we think about marketing now because we are now in the go-to-market phase that this is the most important thing of the company. Occasionally I found companies that have challenging and shifting gears so they didn't figure out where the clutch is and you have to because otherwise you're stuck in the previous phase that you kind of finished that journey. This journey is nearly done and you need to shift gears, and if you don't do that, then you get stuck. If you do that, if you try to do multiple things at the same time, you will fail. Focus is not about what we are doing, it's about what we are not doing. These are the hard decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
I like that. So the four phases, just to briefly summarize, it's kind of like come up with the idea, find product market fit, then it's a question of should you keep focusing on growth or should you figure out the business model before focusing heavily on growth? In your advice, it sounds like if it's high frequency, word-of-mouth driven, focus on growth and then you figure out business model later. If not, figure out how you're going to make money and then figure out growth.

Uri Levine (00:35:14):
Exactly. Because if you have high frequency of use, you will end up with growth coming by itself, right, for word-of-mouth, and therefore you should do that at the beginning. If you don't have high frequency of use, you are sentenced to acquire users or customers all of your lifetime. If this is the case, then you really want to figure out the business model before you start and go and do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):
That's really helpful. I think actually a counter example to your point about how frequency of use is necessary for word-of-mouth growth is Airbnb. Something like 70% of Airbnb growth is word-of-mouth and frequency of use is actually really low. It's like once or twice a year. I wonder if it's because the experience is so unique and special that it still works and enough people travel enough times, slash if it was a higher frequency, it would've grown even faster, I imagine.

Uri Levine (00:36:09):
High frequency of use is the simplest way for word-of-mouth. The other thing is coolness. If it's really cool, then you'll tell more people, and Airbnb was really cool at the beginning of the journey, so now everyone knows about Airbnb, but when they started that was way cheaper and really unique experience than hotels.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
It's still actually mostly word-of-mouth. I think it was probably higher initially, but it's still almost 70, 80% driven by word-of-mouth. So it's still cool enough. Good for them. You have a couple of quotes that I wanted to share, which are along the lines of things you shared. One is just, you have this kind of, what's the most important stage at a company? They all are, but one at a time. I love that line. The other is the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. The same advice you just shared. Just like focus. So you're in the PM, product market fit phase. Focus on that. Don't think about growth yet. Don't think about business model yet necessarily. I know investors are going to push you to figure these things out and you'll have to have some story of like, "Here's how it might make money. Here's how we think we're going to grow." Right? You need to think about that a little bit, but maybe don't make that the focus.

Uri Levine (00:37:22):
So this is one of the areas that investors don't like to hear the truth, right? The truth is that I don't know how I'm going to bring the users. I will figure that out once I get there, but the reality is that right now I don't know, but they don't want to hear that. What they want to hear is that, "Oh, I know exactly how I'm going to bring them." And what I will say is that I know exactly where I'm going to start my experiments, but most of the investors would like to see a coherent story that makes sense, right? This is our business model. This is how we going to make money. This is what we're going to sell. This is how much they're going to pay. This is why it's a simple business model and these are the comparable to this business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
Yeah. But investors have the final word, unfortunately. They decide if they want to invest or not, and so if your story is not compelling, they're going to be like, "All right. We'll find someone else."

Uri Levine (00:38:13):
You know, it's seasonality, right? There are periods of time that raising capital is easier and then many of the entrepreneurs will be choosers are not beggars, and there are periods of time that is that way around, and most of the entrepreneurs will be beggars and not choosers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B.

(00:39:24):
In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to LinkedIn.com/podLenny to claim your credit. That's LinkedIn.com/podLenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:39:52):
Let's actually talk about fundraising as a topic I wanted to spend a little time on. How much money have you raised for the companies that you've started total, roughly?

Uri Levine (00:40:02):
So Waze raised about $50 million throughout the entire journey. We started by raising 12. That was the first investment round, and then we raised the 30, and then there was the last round that we raised actually not a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
That's a surprising small amount of money to raise for the outcome.

Uri Levine (00:40:28):
In general, I would say Israeli startups are leaner than American startups, so you can raise less money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
Yeah, that's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:37):
At way lower valuation, unfortunately, and end up with pretty successful results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):
That's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:45):
Raising capital, it's a journey by itself and different from the other journeys that you need only once. Raising capital is going to happen multiple times. And if we say that building a startup is a roller coaster journey, then I will say raising capital is a roller coaster journey in the dark.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
It's like Space Mountain.

Uri Levine (00:41:09):
Yeah, sort of. And one of the reason is that this is a different ballgame and you don't know how to play at the beginning. I would say a few things about raising capital for the first time. Number one, I spoke with many investors and one of the conversations that I had that they really, really resonate with me was when I spoke with one of the leading VC in Israel and asked their partner, "How long does it take you to decide if you like the entrepreneur or not?" And he asked me, "Do you want the right answer or the real answer?" Say, "You know, I heard the right answer so many times, give me the real answer." And we were sitting in a small meeting room, so the guy is looking at me and then looking at the door and looking at me again and say, "It's before they sit down." Say, "Oh, no, no, no. Say that again, right?"

(00:42:02):
That's the first impression. Now we all have first impression. How long does it take you to decide if you like a candidate or not? Second, you go on a date. How long does it take you to decide if you like the date? Seconds. And then maybe there are a few more minutes that you allow yourself to either change your mind or let that first impression solidifies. Now if this is the case and you're looking to raise capital, start with the strongest point at the beginning. Whatever it is, and I don't care if this is the size of the problem. This is the faction that you have. This is the team that you have built. I don't care what it is, start with that, because by the time you'll get there, they might be already setting up their mind. Then start with the strongest point at the beginning. And by the way, finish with that as well.

(00:42:53):
So this is the first conclusion. The second conclusion is that I spoke with early stage investors, those that invest the first money in. So company has a story to tell. That's about it, right? No traction, nothing yet is built and so forth, and I asked him, "Why did you decide to invest in this company and this company and this company?" And I spoke with many investors, and what I heard was actually pretty consistent. I like the CEO. I like the story. That's it. I like the CEO. I like the story. Now if this is the case, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that the CEO goes alone to the meeting. I need the headlight on me. I don't need any distractions. I don't need my team members. I don't need anything else in the room, just me. Because if I bring other people, then at the end of the day they might say, "Yeah, I like the team, but the CEO was not specific, right? Was not unique. Was not jumping out of the pages." So CEO goes along and tell the story.

(00:44:02):
The other part is that they need to tell a good story, and good story is not about facts. It's about creating emotional engagement. It's about creating the sense that the listener would like to be part of this story. And for investor, it's two things. Number one is that they want to believe that this is usable, and number two, they want to believe that you can build it and this is the story that you need to tell. Now, I would say always start with the problem, right? Because guess what? Investors are also users. If they don't think that they're going to use it, so it's relevant for them, and they don't think that they're going to use it? They will basically dismiss that. They will basically say the market is not there.

(00:44:52):
So these are two main things. The third thing is it's a different ball game, right? So if you have product and you tell the story to potential customers, the right order of magnitude is that about one third of the listeners will buy. So in a more mature company, their pipeline is going to be three eggs in order to sell at the end of the year one eggs. One third are going to say yes. In investors, it's 1%. Not one third, 1%. So you're going to hear a hundred times no until you hear one yes. And that a hundred times no is something that you need to understand from the beginning because that's really discouraging, right? You go and speak with investors and they tell you... I call that they open up the big book of excuses why not. But in general, they are not going to invest, right?

(00:45:54):
Now you look at it from the other side, a venture capital partner is likely to see between a hundred and 200 companies a year and invest in one or two. 1%. That's it. So if this is the case, then it's going to be the same case for you. One out of a hundred. If you want to increase the likelihood, learn how to tell a good story, start at the strongest point at the beginning, remember that they are users, too, so their emotional engagement is going to come through the usage, the use case, and not through how big the business is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:34):
I love the summary at the end. I love that you summarized your points, because I try to do that. You did my job. I love this phrase you have in your book, "The dance of 100 nos."

Uri Levine (00:46:44):
At the beginning you look at it and you say, "Okay, they say they decided not to invest because of X, Y, Z," right? Whatever it is, right? Google can do that in no time or the market is not big enough or the market is complex or whatever it is, and then you try to argue, and you don't know that it's useless, right? It's like you go on a date and she said no, and you try to argue, right? No, there is nothing to argue anymore, right? That's no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
Yeah. I look at a lot of startups too. I do a bunch of angel investing, and yeah, if it's not going to be a fit, it's just not going to work, and I could spend all this time trying to explain it to you, but nothing's going to change. And because there's other startups out there is a big part of it, right? You just want to pick the things you can that are the best, not necessarily things that are good ideas. I really like this idea of starting with your strongest point. That's such an important tactical piece of advice. To your point, investors make decisions really quickly, and so starting with something that really catches their attention, it makes so much sense because once you feel like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is a thing," your whole brain is starting to look at it from a, oh, yeah, okay, like you have a positive bend on everything you're hearing versus like, "No, no, no, this is never going to work and everything is already biased."

Uri Levine (00:48:00):
So I would add here another very strong advice. Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation. The most important slide of your presentation is the first slide, not the one that you think about it. The first slide. The one that says Company XYZ intro. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:29):
Wow, that's a good point.

Uri Levine (00:48:31):
The longest period of time in the presentation, this slide is going to be presented on the screen and you didn't say anything there. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):
I love that. Is there an example of someone that did that or did you do that, one of your startups? What do you put there?

Uri Levine (00:48:51):
I do that all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
What's an example of something you put on that slide that's such a good idea?

Uri Levine (00:48:56):
Maybe size of the market. Maybe description of the problem. Whatever it is, right, the strongest point is there. Now the second most important slide is the last one. Not the summary. The one that says thank you. That's the time to repeat that. So most of their presentations will end up with thank you and my email, right, and this is going to be the last slide, right? Which makes sense. You just missed the opportunity. This is going to be the second-longest displayed slide of the presentation. Maybe the first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:39):
Yeah. Everyone's sitting there chatting, asking you questions. That's so smart. Are there any more of these tips sitting in your head to share, because these are awesome.

Uri Levine (00:49:48):
I do a lot of public speaking and usually my last slide says one more story and I decide on the story based on the audience and the dialogue so far and so forth. But I have many of stories, many last stories that I would like to tell. The important part is that no one is going to cut you off the stage if you have just one more story, and so this is where you can recap everything. This is where you can do whatever you want, right? Because no one is going to tell you, "Okay, time is up."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):
Right, and they're not impatient because they're like, "Okay, it's almost over. Let's just let him finish."

Uri Levine (00:50:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:31):
Yeah. I love that. Speaking of stories, what's the wildest fundraising story that you've been through? Is there one that comes to mind of like, "Holy shit. I can't believe that happened," or, "I can't believe that worked out"?

Uri Levine (00:50:43):
One of the earlier startups that I was guiding was about, eventually rolled into gift cards, but in Israel, when you return something to the store, you don't get your money back. What you get is a gift card for that particular store, right, and obviously if you return something, then it's not necessarily that you have something to buy in the store and you ended up with having a gift card that is never being used, and so why not sell this gift card? What happened is that I heard the story of the CEO and I thought that the story is not good enough, and I told him, "Look, you have to tell a better story," and asked, "Can you give me an example?" And I said, "Yeah, just imagine that," and then there was a long story about the microwave stuff working, and I bought a new one and really long, long, long story about with the details, right? How do you make a story make believe? With details. Right? The more details people think that this is real. Right?

(00:51:48):
If there are no details, then this is not real. So I told him this story that was like five minutes explaining, trying to fit the microwave into the closet and it didn't fit in into the cabinet, and it didn't fit in, and I had to return it to the box and so forth and whole story. And then I spoke with an investor in Israel and I told him about this new company that I'm going to invest, and I told him the same story about this microwave, right, and he said, "This is interesting. I would like to meet the CEO." Then he met the CO and CEO told him exactly the same story about the microwave. When I tell that, this is my microwave, right?This is personal. This has happened to me. And so he told me, the investor called me up later, he said, "He told me exactly the same story." So that was really funny.

(00:52:44):
But at the end of the day, one of the things that makes story authentic is details, because otherwise it's not, right? If you're going to tell me, okay, this is the use case of the product and you end up with explaining a use case in three lines, this is not authentic. If you watch your real users, then what happens is that you actually, and you speak with them, then you have the audacity to tell a good story. Really, really critical. If you want to tell user story, these needs to be, real or you have to learn how to tell a story with many details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:29):
But interestingly, it sounds like the story itself doesn't have to have happened to you in real life. It could be a made-up story, but with a lot of details is the lesson there. Interesting.

Uri Levine (00:53:38):
Yep. If you tell it very briefly, then it doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Amazing. Any other advice along those lines? I want to talk about two more chapters before we wrap up. Is there anything else around fundraising that you think is important for people to know?

Uri Levine (00:53:54):
So I will tell you which chapters I would like to speak about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Let's do it. I wonder what they are. I wonder if they're the same.

Uri Levine (00:54:02):
Understanding users and firing and hiring.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:04):
Okay, firing and hiring. That was on my list. Okay. Let's start there and then understanding users wasn't, but I'm excited to hear what you have to say there.

Uri Levine (00:54:14):
So I send the book proposal to many publisher, and there is one chapter that says firing and hiring, and many of them came back and say, "Oh, it should be hiring and firing." And I said, "No. Firing is hard decision. Hiring is easy decisions." You have to first of all learn how to make the hard decisions. Now, the inspirations for this chapter came from many dialogues that I had with entrepreneurs that their startup failed, and I asked them, "Why, what happened?" And about half told me the team was not right, and I kept on asking, "Okay, what do you mean the team was not right?" And what I heard the most is, "We had this guy not good enough and this guy not good enough." So this is what I heard the most.

(00:54:58):
Another thing that I heard quite often is that we had communication issues, right? Something that I actually called ego management issues. And then asked them the most interesting question, "When did you know that the team is not right?" Now the answer was actually rather scary. All of them told me within the first month. Then you said, "Wait a minute. If you knew within the first month that the team is not right and you didn't do anything, the problem was not that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decision." Making hard decisions is hard. Making easy decisions. This is why no one likes to make the hard decisions, because you need to live with the consequences. In a small place like a startup, the hard decisions will always go to the top. Now, if the CEO does not make that hard decisions, the result is always the same. The top performing people would leave. Now, they would leave because they don't want to be in a place that is unable to make hard decisions and they have a choice.

(00:56:02):
The nature of the beast is different. Startup is a small organization. Just imagine that you are a small organization, like could be a team, whatever it is, right? 10, 20, 30 people, and there is someone that shouldn't be there, and I don't care if that someone shouldn't be there because they are way underperforming or because they are assholes. I don't really care. They shouldn't be there. Everyone knows. Everyone knows and the CEO doesn't do anything. That's the nature of the beast and this is why top performing people would leave. Now, building a startup is really, really hard, right? It's hard if you have the right team, but if you have people that shouldn't be there that are still there and the top performing people are leaving, then it's going to be mission impossible. The conclusion of this chapter is really, really interesting. If everyone knows within a month and every time that you hire someone new, what I really want you to do is mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?"

(00:57:16):
At the end of the day, I'd like to nail that into yes or no, right? Because this is where decisions are being made easily. If you ask yourself that question, if the answer is yes, then go to this person and tell them that you are really excited that they've joined, they are exceeding your expectations, and give them more equity, and you buy their loyalty for life. If the answer is no, fire them immediately. They're already set on a trajectory of not being successful and they're creating damage to you, to the rest of the team and to themselves, right? They deserve to be successful, but it's not going to happen here. They deserve to find someplace else that they can be successful, but it's not going to happen here, and that decision is really, really dramatic.

(00:58:08):
Now, in many cases with hard decisions, we know what is the right decisions. We are looking for confirmation. If you look for confirmation, then go and speak with the top performing people and tell them, ask them the following, right? "Assuming XYZ person is going to leave, how sore are you going to feel?" And you will be surprised that they are going to tell you, "Oh, it's not a big deal." This is your confirmation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:40):
Yeah. We had Elizabeth Stone from Netflix, the CTO of Netflix on, and she talked about this thing they called a keeper test, which is exactly that, where every manager is always asking themselves, "If this person were to leave tomorrow and tell me they're leaving, would I fight to keep them? And if not, I should just, I need to let them go," and that's always top of mind for managers there.

Uri Levine (00:58:59):
You know, one of my companies had a pretty good year and they decided to have an annual bonuses by and large to nearly all of the employees. And then I asked the CEO, "So how did you end up with the list?" And he said, "Okay. We had these people that getting twice as much the others, and then the others, and then there are four people that are not going to get anything." And I asked them, "Are they still here?" They shouldn't be here, right? If they are so much underperforming, then they shouldn't be here. But generally you need the time to ask yourself the tough questions because only then you can answer them, right? If you don't ask the tough questions, then you don't answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):
Yeah. I really love this very tactical piece of advice, which I was definitely going to touch on, of putting a calendar entry into your calendar when you hire someone 30 days in to remind yourself, asking yourself, "Would I hire this person knowing what I know now? And if not, you should probably let them go."

Uri Levine (01:00:06):
By the way, I can tell you that for everything in your life, right? Everything in your life, ask yourself, "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Wow.

Uri Levine (01:00:17):
If the answer is yes, then do something different today. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):
That is powerful advice. So what I'm thinking there is if I bought something, maybe return it. What else have you applied that to in your life?

Uri Levine (01:00:31):
Relationship in general. Directions that you're going, right? Do you still like that? I have five children and they're all in their twenties and beginning of thirties and they struggle with their career path, and I basically tell them, "Look, if you are going to work in a place and you don't like it, then what I want you to do is ask yourself why you are not liking it and whether or not there is something that you can change, and I'm going to ask you the same question in 90 days from now, and if this still is the case, then quit."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):
It's interestingly you make that 90 days, which it kind of applies some decisions. You need to wait a little bit more. You need more data. You need more time than necessarily 30 days, but set some kind of timeline.

Uri Levine (01:01:24):
If you don't set a timeline, it'll never happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):
I think the other really interesting implication here is most decisions are a two-way door. Most decisions, you can change your mind. You can quit. You can leave a relationship. I was thinking you were going to say with your five kids 30 days after they're born, "Do I still want this kid 30 days with knowing what I know now?" I'm glad you didn't go there.

Uri Levine (01:01:52):
No, this is different, right? You go into this journey of having children with the understanding that this is long journey. Go into this journey of building a startup with the understanding that this is a long journey, right? The fact that it's going to be hard? Okay, so it's hard. It is hard, by the way. But yeah, the decisions that obviously they need to be relative to their duration, right? So yeah, raising kids is a long journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
And a one-way door, also. Is there anything else you wanted to say around the hiring and firing concept? Clearly firing is the main lesson here, is get really good at firing, firing quickly and decisively.

Uri Levine (01:02:41):
You know, there are tons of advices in the book and eventually I will tell, even in the hiring process, right, most of us are going to interview candidates and then decide that they like or dislike the candidate, but they don't know. Then speak with someone that does know. Speak with the reference.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:02):
Do you have a favorite question you like to ask references? Is there something that you find is really helpful to tell you? Give you honest insight?

Uri Levine (01:03:09):
For reference?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
Yeah.

Uri Levine (01:03:11):
That's really simple. Would you hire him? Or would you hire her, right? So essentially at the end of the day you want to nail it into yes or no.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:26):
Yeah. And hope that they're being honest. That's sometimes a challenge.

Uri Levine (01:03:31):
No, if they will tell me yes, then I would ask them, "Why didn't you?" Someone asked me for a reference on someone that I really enjoyed working with. I really think highly of them, and he asked me if they can schedule a call for half an hour and I said, "Look, I'm traveling. I don't really have time. But if you want an email in one word, take the guy." And then he was trying to outsmart and ask me back, "Can I have that in two words?" And I said, "Yeah, take the guy fast." When you know, you know. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
I like that. That's what you want to be looking for. Okay. Amazing. So let's do one more chapter. The one I was going to pick, you choose what you're more excited about, is selling a company. Your last chapter exit. The one you were thinking about going to is talking to users. I imagine that's much more applicable to more people, so that's probably the better choice, but your choice.

Uri Levine (01:04:28):
Okay, then let's stick with understanding users. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, wrote the foreword to my book and he called it the Bible for entrepreneurs, and when I sent him the first chapter, he said, "Wow, I wish I had that When I started." I met Steve Wozniak for the first time about 10 years ago. We spoke at the same conference in Guatemala, and look, when I grew up, Steve Wozniak was my technological guru, right so he was the most important person in the technology space in my mind. And then we spoke at the same conference and we had dinner the night before, and the only thing that actually was really important for me is to have a selfie with my idol, right? And so I took up my iPhone and with the iPhone you can take pictures by clicking here on the screen or using the volume button on the side, right?

(01:05:34):
And so I took a selfie with him holding the phone like that and clicking on the volume button and he said, "Finally." And I said, "Finally what?" "Finally someone using it the way that I meant it to be." Now you realize that there is no right or wrong. There are different people that are using different products in different ways, and occasionally if I would have large audience, then I would ask the people, "Okay, how do you use Waze?" Right? "So you go to your destination and you enter destination, and then Waze guides you through the screen with the display of the maneuvers that needs to be made or with the audio guidance of turn right, turn left and so forth. If you are watching the screen, raise your hand." And then I would have about 70% of the people raise their hand." Then I ask people to watch around them and see those people. Then I ask, "If you are listening to the audio prompt, raise your hand." Then I have about 20 or 30 more percent of the people raising their hand. And again, I send people to watch around and see those hands.

(01:06:41):
There is no right or wrong. Different people are using it differently. Now, if you are using Waze in a certain way, up until this moment, you didn't know that there are other people that are using it differently, and to be frank, you don't care. You getting your own value the way that you get it, then you don't really care that there are other people that are getting it differently. But if you are building a product and you don't know that, then you are building the wrong product. You don't know that there are other people that are not like you, and you think that you're building the product for yourself, then you're making a big mistake. And the way to figure it out is, by the way, two things. Number one, watch new users. Simply watch users and see what they're doing. And number two, if they're not doing what you expect them to do, then ask them why, because this why is the one that is going to make your product successful. You understand the why and the next version you're going to address that.

(01:07:42):
Now, this is in particular when it comes to understanding users. Obviously there are a lot of users, but we can group them into several groups of their ability to adapt something new, and something new is not necessarily new technology. We think about it as a new technology, but it's not necessarily about technology. It's about new behavior, right? And then we look at the entire population and every time that we look into large numbers, they will have normal distribution, right? So the bell curve of the distribution, and then we will have about 2% of the populations that they're the innovatives. The innovatives are going to use something new because it's new. That's it. They care about this subject and they going to be the first one to hear about it and they're going to try that out because it's new. The second group is usually what we will get to see as the first users are the early adapters. As soon as they realize that there is value, they're going to give it a try. And if there is value, then they will keep on using it, and if there is no value, then they will quit. Right?

(01:08:55):
The third group is the most important group. This is where market leaders are, right? This is called the early majority. This is about one third of the population, and the one that wins the early majority wins the market. The challenge with this group, with the people in this group, is that they're afraid of change. So their state of mind is, don't rock the boat. Whatever I'm currently doing is good enough for me. So if you have Salesforce.com, which is absolutely amazing, their reaction is going to be, "What's wrong with Excel?" And because they're afraid of change, they are not going to try something new. Now the reason is that at the end of the day, they're afraid that this is going to be too complex for them and they will not get it, and they don't want to be embarrassed and they don't want to feel like idiots. And guess what? People don't like to feel like idiots, and so they are not going to try. And you need to see those people to understand their barriers for starting to use your service.

(01:10:02):
And by the way, the solution is always the same. Simplicity. Leonardo da Vinci said that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. If you want to make it simple, in your journey of building a product, we basically say this is iteration to iteration to iteration. In many of those you add features and you add features and you add features until you all of a sudden you add the features that people are using. What you really want to do next is remove the rest of the features that people are not using because they're adding complexity. Now, most of the product owners, they're either innovators or early adopters. You cannot understand an early majority person. If you belong to one group, you cannot understand a person from that group unless you watch them and [inaudible 01:10:57]. So the most important part of understanding users is actually seeing those users. And they are not wrong. This is how they behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):
So a couple of threads there I'll pull out. One is look for surprising uses of your product because, as you said, you'll realize, "Oh, some people are using this in a way that I didn't expect," and it'll remind you people are not the way you are and don't assume that they're going to want exactly what you're building, so pay attention to things that surprise you. We had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast and he talked through a lot of this stuff, and one of the lessons there to help you bridge that gap from, to the, what is it, the third group? How did you describe it? The late majority?

Uri Levine (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Uri Levine (01:11:44):
Late majority will never use the product. They will use your product only if they have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):
Yeah. The laggards, I think he calls it. They look for basically references. People telling them, "Hey, you really need to use this." A lot of people, just like basically word-of-mouth is the way you described it.

Uri Levine (01:11:58):
No, not just word-of-mouth. Even occasionally someone to show them how to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):
Yeah. That makes sense. Just like, "Here, check out Waze. Here's how it works." Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Amazing. Is there anything else along those lines as you're talking to customers and understanding what you're looking for that you want to share?

Uri Levine (01:12:17):
Occasionally what happens is that we speak with the wrong customers. So just imagine that we have what I call funnel of use, right? So on top of the funnel, we have people that are download the app, let's say, or have entered their website, and then the next phase is that they registered and the next phase that they're trying to use it for the first time and then the next phase is that they're getting the value and they're coming back, right? In this funnel, what we usually try to do is speak with the users at the bottom of the funnels, those that were successful. But in order to improve, we need to speak with those that fail, those that were unsuccessful, those that did not register, or they did register and did not use, or they did use and did not come back, because they know something that we really need to know. Why? This why is what makes a great product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):
Interesting. I imagine you could also fall into danger there if people that just aren't a fit for your product, there's just no point wasting your time on people that are just not going to be a fit. So is the idea there find people that are really far down the funnel but still bounced and churned?

Uri Levine (01:13:34):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
Awesome. Amazing. Okay. So we've gone through all the chapters I was hoping to go through, plus the ones you were excited about. Final thing before we get to our very exciting lightning round, we have a segment on this podcast called Fail Corner, where I ask a guest to share a time they failed in their career and what they learned from that experience, and I'm curious if there is a story that comes to mind of a time that you failed either in a startup or as you were an employee somewhere and how that was important to you.

Uri Levine (01:14:05):
So number one, I reserve the right for my biggest failure yet to come. And look, I keep on trying new things. I keep on doing things, and so eventually I will fail as much as... Maybe I'm more successful statistically than others, but I will fail, and this is very, very important part to realize. Don't be afraid to fail, right? In your journey, you're going to fail multiple times, and when you fail and get up, you get up stronger. This is maybe something that I will tell all the parents in the world. The biggest advice that I can give you is teach your children to fail. Because when they get up, they get up stronger, and when they know that they will get out of their comfort zone and they will eventually discover what makes them happy. At the end of the day, as parents, there's only one thing that we really like. We want our kids to be happy in their own way. We don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. We want them to explore, and they will only explore if they are not afraid to fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
Yeah. This is a very timely advice for me because our kid is always falling down and it's always this balance between helping them not fall and letting them figure things out.

Uri Levine (01:15:27):
Let them fall. There is a Japanese saying, fall seven times and get up eight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Uri Levine (01:15:43):
No, I think that was actually, I really enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):
Amazing. Well, we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Uri Levine (01:15:50):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people other than your own book?

Uri Levine (01:15:58):
Mark Randolph of Netflix. That Will Never Work, right? And by the way, it's funny. Mark Randolph wrote endorsement to my book and I reached out to him because I read someplace that he's answering all of his emails, and I reached, I sent him an email and said, "Look, we have at least three things in common. Number one, I do answer all of my emails as well. Number two, I'm using your product, you are using mine. And number three, I heard more time that will never work than you did." And I think that understanding this journey is really, really important, so this is definitely a book that I would recommend. Atomic Habits. Getting habits and improving them, measuring and improving, is really, really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Very cool choices. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Uri Levine (01:17:02):
I don't watch a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Easy, then. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Uri Levine (01:17:11):
So I can bet that most of the people say the ChatGPT, but actually no. I recently downloaded the Chess App and I returned to play chess with the computer or something that I haven't done for so many years, and I really enjoy that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Amazing. It's actually, I don't think ChatGPT has ever been recommended. Recent choices have been a beautiful Persian rug, a Rivian, a very nice Mercedes, and I think recently it was a course on nervous system regulation.

Uri Levine (01:17:48):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:49):
All over the place. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find really useful in work, your own life? It may be the one on your shirt, but is there any other that you come back to often and find useful?

Uri Levine (01:18:03):
Don't be afraid to fail. I think that in many cases we need to accept the fact that we don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):
Important words. Final question, is there a problem you're starting to fall in love with more recently, maybe tinkering with a new startup idea? Or are you done with starting companies?

Uri Levine (01:18:21):
I probably will never be done. I have 10 different startups in multiple areas. One of them, Pontera helps people to retire richer, which is one of the biggest challenges in the world in general, but also in the U.S. If I would ask a hundred people on the street that have 401k plans, "What is your 401k plan invested at?" 95% of them will tell me, "I don't know." I do know, by the way. In the default. Whatever was the default when they joined, right? Now obviously if you didn't do anything and you think it's right, no, it's not right. It's probably simply not enough. So this is a big problem. I have one in the medical space that is trying to create, I would call that the AI of the medical knowledge, so trying to improve doctors, and in particular in clinical decisions. That is going to change the world.

(01:19:27):
But if you would ask me, then I will give you some examples, right? So mobility is still a problem, right? You look at many areas in our lifetime and mobility is still, every year it's, instead of getting better, it's getting lesser. So mobility is still a problem. And medical services, right? U.S. medical services are five to 10 times more expensive than they are in Germany. Now, it's not that they're better. They're simply more expensive. So obviously you ask yourself, "Okay, where is this inefficiency? Where is it?" Right? A lot of places of inefficiency in the medical services if they're so expensive. Education. Okay. Anything that I will tell you that we are still doing the same way that our parents did is probably something that we need to revisit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:22):
I feel like I nerd sniped you with falling in love with problems. Clearly fall in love with a lot of problems. You want to solve them all. You're addicted to startups.

Uri Levine (01:20:29):
The good news is that there are a lot of problems and the bad news that there are lots of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:34):
And you're there to solve it. I love it. Uri, your book is amazing. It's incredibly practical, full of tons of advice that every founder should read, and it goes from idea all the way to exit. So basically, no matter where you're on the journey, the book is going to be useful to you. Tell people where to find it and where they can follow you for more stuff that you share over time, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Uri Levine (01:20:56):
So obviously this is the book. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, basically places that you can find it. You can follow me on LinkedIn. This is pretty much the only network that I'm actually engaged. If you read the book, then you will find my email in the book and then you can email me, as well. And I do answer all of my emails. I want you to read the book. I don't want you to buy the book. I want you to read the book. And the reason is that I have a purpose in life and this is creating value, and I believe that this book is going to be the best return on investment that you ever made. Not the $20 or $30 that it costs, but the time that you're going to spend on reading it, and therefore, I can be valuable for you, and if I can be valuable for you, then I serve my purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):
Amazing. If you weren't on YouTube watching this, the book is called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, if you're trying to Google it and find that on Amazon. And Uri, thank you so much for being here.

Uri Levine (01:22:05):

Varun Mohan (00:00:00):
A lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks away. We should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of existing product look dumb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:00:16):
I want the company to almost be like this dehydrated entity. Every hire is like a little bit of water, and we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Any other there skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:00:29):
The engineers are now able to produce more technology. The ROI of building technology has actually gone up. This actually means you hire more. The best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. You could be a force multiplier to your organization in ways in which they never even anticipated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
Today my guest is Varun Mohan. Varun is the co-founder and CEO of Windsurf, which has quickly become one of people's favorite AI coding tools, and is basically the main competitor to Cursor with over 1 million users four months in. In our conversation, Varun shares what makes Windsurf unique, why they decided to invest heavily in enterprise sales very early in their history, why agency is going to be the most important skill for engineers and product builders to build, also the story of how they started out as a GPU infrastructure company and realized there was a much bigger opportunity up the stack and the two pivots that got them to where they're today.

(00:01:20):
He also gives a live demo, advice for being successful at Windsurf, and so much more. There's so much to learn about where things are heading for engineers and product builders in general in this conversation. And I'm really excited to bring it to you.

(00:04:00):
Varun, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Varun Mohan (00:04:03):
Buddy, thanks for having me. A long time listener.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:05):
Oh, I really appreciate that. I'm so excited to have you here. I feel like just you guys have become this overnight success, which is definitely not an overnight success, but I feel like I've been hearing about Windsurf more and more as people's favorite AI tool. And I just don't think people know the story behind Windsurf, behind Codeium, the company that you built. So I thought it'd be good to maybe just start there and have you just briefly share the history of Codeium and how Windsurf emerged out of Codeium.

Varun Mohan (00:04:31):
Yeah. So the company was actually started close to four years ago. As you know, AI coding was not a thing four years ago. ChatGPT was not out four years ago. At the time, we actually started out building GPU virtualization and compiler software. Before this, I worked in autonomous vehicles. My co-founder, who I had known since middle school, worked on AR/VR at Meta. And for us, we believe deep learning would touch many, many industries. It wouldn't just touch autonomous vehicles. It would touch financial services, defense, healthcare. And we believe these applications were hard to build, these deep learning applications. So we made it possible for you to effectively run these complex applications on computers without GPUs, and we would handle all the complexity of being able to actually run the workload on the GPUs for you. And we were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:05:20):
And in the middle of 2022 rolled around and we had a couple million in revenue and we were managing upwards of 10,000 sort of GPUs. We had eight people. At the time, we were free cash flow positive. But I think what we felt was once these generative models started to get very good, we sort of felt a lot of what we built was not as valuable. And this was a very, very hard moment for us at the company. We were only eight people at the time, but we felt, "Hey, would people be training these very bespoke sentiment classifier models anymore that were very, very custom models? Or would they just ask GPT-N, is this a positive or a negative sentiment?" Probably it's going to be the latter, right? And in a world in which everyone was going to run generative AI models, why would an infrastructure company be a differentiator? Because everyone is going to run the same kind of infrastructure down the line.

(00:06:06):
So instead what we decided to do was we believe generative AI was almost going to be like the next internet. And in that case, what we should go out and do is build the next great apps like Google, like Amazon. And we vertically integrated and actually took our infrastructure, our inference infrastructure to go out and build Codeium at the time. And at that time, we were early adopters of GitHub Copilot and we thought the coding space was going to get tremendously disrupted in the next coming years. So we actually took our infrastructure, we ran our own models in massive scale. We even trained our own models.

(00:06:35):
In the very beginning it was very, very simple. It was purely an autocomplete model, which basically means that as the user was typing, we'd complete the next one or two or three or four lines of code. But we provided the product entirely for free in all the IDEs that developers coded. That meant to VSCode, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Vim, Emacs. And the reason why we were able to build it for free was because of our infrastructure background. We were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:07:04):
I guess very quickly after that, some large businesses also wanted to work with us. And we built out this enterprise motion to work with these large companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. And for them the bigger thing wasn't just, "Hey, could we autocomplete code or could we chat with the code base?" It was, "Could you offer us a secure offering that was also personalized to all the private data inside the company?" So we took our infrastructure and made it so that we invested a ton in making sure that we deeply understood these large companies code bases. And that's what we were working on until six months ago.

(00:07:33):
It's not that we've stopped working on that, but basically what we realized six months ago was we were getting limited by the IDEs that we were already working in. So VSCode, which is a very popular IDE, had a ceiling for the AI capabilities, we could showcase our users. And because of that, we decided to go out and fork VSCode and build our own IDE with some of these new agentic capabilities. And over time in the last couple of years, the model capabilities have also been growing exponentially year over year. And that's sort of where we are right now. I skipped a lot of pieces there, but that's what we're landed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:05):
There's so many interesting threads there. One is just, there's always this question of just where value will accrue in AI. And it's so interesting, you guys started almost at the bottom layer of infrastructure GPUs and then you went to what people call a GPT wrapper, not actually. So I guess any just lessons there, just thoughts on just where you think value will end up in this world of AI and the stack of AI tools?

Varun Mohan (00:08:28):
Maybe I can start by just saying one thing about startups that I think are really true, it's very unlikely the first thing that you believe you should go work on is going to be the right thing, which is a very hard thing to kind of wrangle with being a startup founder, right? You need to kind of be irrationally optimistic that what you're going to do is going to be differentially important. Because otherwise, why would you go out and do what you're doing? And if it's obvious, then a bigger company would've already done it, right?

(00:08:56):
But then you also need to be really, really realistic because most ideas that are, I guess, non-conventional are usually bad ideas, right? So it's this weird tightrope you need to kind of balance on top of where you're pushing for a future that you believe is true, but all the while you're getting new information. You need to kill the beliefs that you had. And if I were to start with the infrastructure piece, we first went in with the assumption that model architectures were going to be really, really heterogeneous.

(00:09:27):
Working from an autonomous vehicle background, there were many different types of model architectures out there. There were convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, sort of lighter neural nets with frustrum point networks. And there were maybe tens of architectures we were dealing with. And at that point we were like, the complexity of this is so high that it's very clear if someone offloaded the complexity, there would be a lot of value.

(00:09:50):
Fast-forward to the middle of 2023, everything looks like it's going to be a transformer. So now our hypotheses are just wrong. So at this point then, most of the value is probably not going to accrue at purely the, at least this is our belief, at the infrastructure layer. It's going to accrue somewhere else. Where is the layer that you can actually differentiate on? And we believe the application layer is a very, very deep layer to go out and differentiate on, right? What are the number of ways we can build better user experiences and better workflows for developers? We think there's effectively no ceiling on that, on how much better we can make the lives of developers basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
You touched on the second thread that I thought was really interesting here, is just how you guys pivoted from ideas that were working. You were making money, people loved it. You said you had millions of dollars of ARR revenue. And then you're just like, "No, we're going to completely change the business."

(00:10:36):
So the question there is, just like, what have you learned about knowing what to follow? And one thing I heard there that was really interesting is just once your assumptions change about that you built your idea on, it's time to think this idea and maybe try something else.

Varun Mohan (00:10:48):
I think the way we sort of think about this is even when we're working right now, we just accept that we're going to get a lot of things wrong. We're just going to get a lot of things wrong. Obviously that's a very big moment because that was a bet the company moment in the sense that we basically said, told our investors, "Hey, we're making money on this." We had already raised 28 million of capital and we were just like, "Hey, we're just going to pivot entirely from this." And we did that overnight. This wasn't this thing where we just said, "Hey, maybe a quarter, one or two quarters." Because one of the things we knew that's very important for startups is focus.

(00:11:20):
If you're trying to do another thing that you think is big and you're focused on something that you don't believe is valuable, you're guaranteed going to fail at the thing you think is going to be big. So that's a very obvious thing there. But I think once you go in with the assumption that a lot of your hypotheses are going to be wrong, but you will do the most concentrated work possible to go out and validate these hypotheses and you won't be in love with your ideas.

(00:11:41):
I think ideas, it's awesome when you have a great idea, but you should never be too in love with your ideas. And you have an organization that is very truth-seeking. I think a lot of people at the company have had their ideas tested over and over again. Even just building Windsurf. That is not a complete company pivot, but that's a big decision that we made at the company. You kind of need to make some bets. And sometimes you're wrong and sometimes you're right. But if you have an organization that comes out and you feel like morale is not going to be low if you made the wrong decision, that's the best, right? That means you have optionality for the rest of time.

(00:12:14):
And Lenny, one thing that I try to tell the company about this is, this year the total amount of engineering output we'll have is much larger than the engineering output we've had since the beginning of the company's creation 'till now. So that almost means every year is a new lease on life for us, right? It's almost a new way for us to test out an entirely new set of hypotheses. And maybe we were wrong about our original hypotheses in the first place. What makes us more smart than everyone else to be right more times than that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):
That's so empowering. It makes me think about... Uri Levine was on the podcast, co-founder of Waze, and he has this phrase that he wears on his shirt. His book is called this Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. And that feels like that's exactly what you're describing.

(00:12:59):
Okay, so let's talk about Windsurf. What's the simplest way for people to understand what is Windsurf?

Varun Mohan (00:13:04):
Yeah. So Windsurf is an IDE, right? It's an application to go out and build software and build applications. The crazy thing is a lot of people who use the product don't even probably know what an IDE is, which is crazy. And we'll get into that in a second.

(00:13:22):
But why did we go out and build Windsurf and what is Windsurf maybe? Why couldn't we have just done this on top of conventional IDEs like Visual Studio Code? So maybe just to get into this a little bit, as we saw that AI was getting more and more powerful, the way people go out and build technology, we thought the interface for that was going to change remarkably. It was not going to be a conventional pure text editor where the user is writing a handful of lines of code or most of the code and the IDE provides maybe some basic feedback on what the user is doing right or wrong. And the basic feedback could be, "Hey, there's a bug in your software or compiler error in your software." It could do much more, right? It could actually go out and modify large chunks of code.

(00:14:04):
One of the key pieces that we recognized was, with this new paradigm with AI, AI was probably going to write well over 90% of the software, in which case the role of a developer and what they're doing in the IDE is maybe reviewing code. Maybe it's actually a little bit different than what it is in the past. And we'll see this very soon with Windsurf. Maybe when you're using the product, actually a good chunk of the user's time is that you're reviewing what the AI is outputting. So we needed to build custom-review flows into the IDE to actually make it so that it was easier to actually go out and do that, right? Because the developer is not spending all their time writing code.

(00:14:38):
And this is the fundamental premise on why we built the product. We thought we were going to get limited a ton if we had very, very basic UI out there. And I'll give you even a simple example here. We have this auto-complete product that completes a handful of lines of code. Now we've actually launched this offering called Windsurf Tab that basically shows you refactors as well. And these refactors are almost inline refactors. And we were able to build a custom UI for that in Windsurf.

(00:15:03):
But in VSCode, because of the access to the APIs, we needed to dynamically generate images right alongside the user's cursor because we just didn't have access to the capabilities to showcase and edit properly. And what we realized is immediately by porting over to Windsurf, our acceptance rate tripled. Same ML models, it just tripled. So what that, I guess, gave us confidence in is yeah, you could argue technology is very important. And I think technology is very important. But if our users are getting very little value from the technology we're sort of building, you need to really clarify, "Maybe we do need to build a new surface and interface." And that's what Windsurf is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:39):
So the big bet you took there just to make this super clear, is you were initially working within existing IDEs that everyone was familiar with. And then it was like, "This isn't going to get us where we need to go. We're going to try to convince people to switch to something completely new because it's going to be so much better. It's our own IDE."

(00:15:56):
I think maybe people may not recognize just how risky that is, convincing engineers to use something completely new. That's a huge deal.

Varun Mohan (00:16:02):
Yeah, no, of course. And one of the key pieces, maybe Lenny, that would be important to share is a lot of our developers do use Visual Studio Code. But there are lots of people that write in languages like Java, sort of C++ and so on and so forth, and they might use the JetBrains family of IDEs that like IntelliJ. And for us, we are actually still committed to building on those platforms, right? We just felt though that one of the dominant IDEs, which was Visual Studio Code, was limiting the sort of user interface that we could give to our actual customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):
What is the current state of traction for Windsurf? You hear all these crazy numbers about all the competitors in your space. What can you share there for folks just to know?

Varun Mohan (00:16:43):
Yeah, so maybe a handful. We launched the product a bit over four months ago. And in that period of time, over a million developers have tried the product. And obviously we have many hundreds of thousands of monthly active users right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
I love how these days like, "oh, a million. Oh, no big deal." It's just the numbers are absurd these days. We're just getting used to just 100 million ARR here, million users in four months there. It's just like, "Oh, of course. How could you not have that?" But that's absurd. It's just like an insane time right now.

(00:17:12):
You touched on something that I wanted to get to later, but I may as well bring it up now, the question of just how engineering will change in the future. You throw out the stat that 90% of code is going to be written by AI in the future. Dario from Anthropic recently said the same thing. You guys have a really interesting glimpse into just how things will look in the future.

(00:17:31):
So I guess the question is just, how do you think coding specifically will look in the next few years, how different will it be from today?

Varun Mohan (00:17:39):
I think when we think about what is an engineer actually doing, it probably falls into three buckets, right? What should I solve for? How should I solve it? And then solving it. I guess everyone who's working in this space is probably increasingly convinced that solving it, which is just the pure, "I know how I'm going to do it" and just going and doing it. AI is going to handle vast majority, if not all of it. In fact, it probably actually, with some of the work that we've done in terms of deeply understanding code bases, how should I solve it is also going to get closer and closer to getting done. If you deeply understand the environment inside an organization, if you deeply understand the code base, how you should solve it, given best practices when the company also gets solved.

(00:18:19):
So I think what engineering kind of goes to is actually what you wanted engineers to do in the first place, which is, what are the most important business problems that we do need to solve? What are the most important capabilities that we need our application, our product to have? And actually going and prioritizing those and actually going and making the right technical decisions to go out and doing it. And I think that's where engineering is probably heading towards.

(00:18:40):
Now, does that mean that no one needs a CS degree? I think that's maybe a little bit overplayed a little bit just because maybe here's my argument for that. A lot of developers nowadays that build full stack applications, at least until a handful of years ago, they probably went to college and took an operating system course. And in theory, they're not really playing around with the operating system, like the kernel scheduler very frequently. But do those principles help them in understanding why their applications are slow? Do they help them in understanding why some design decisions are better than the other? Yeah, that makes them a much better engineer than another engineer. And I think that idea and the understanding of what's going on at the bottom will make a good engineer even better. But also at the same time, it empowers a bunch of people that never understood all of those things, how to actually build as well, which is another remarkable sort of thing that fell out through this whole process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I don't know if you have kids, but just say you had kids or you had niece or nephew going into college, let's say, would you suggest they do do computer science or would you suggest you're not going to have a good time if that's the career you choose right now?

Varun Mohan (00:19:47):
Yeah. Maybe I think back a little bit. So I went to MIT. A lot of us at the company went to MIT together on the engineering team. I think when I think about what we learned the most for engineering or computer science, it was not exactly like how do you write code. That is almost a given that you can write code after going to college. It's more like the principles of how you think about a problem and how you break it down and how you solve it in an interesting way.

(00:20:15):
So an example of a class that I really enjoyed was our distributed systems class. And there, you're kind of reading through literature and understanding how some design decisions were kind of made. And I think it's more like a problem solving kind of course and a major. It's a major of how you solve problems given some constraints of how computers today function, right? Like, here's the speed at which memory sort of operates. Here's the speed at which... Here's how much computation you can do in one cycle or one second. And based on that, you can make some trade-offs and solve a problem.

(00:20:45):
So I don't know if I would say that you shouldn't go get a computer science degree. I think computer science is almost synonymous with problem solving. In that case, I think it's pretty valuable. Is everything you learn in your computer science degree useful? I'd say a lot of things that I learned in my computer science degree are not useful. I'll give you an example. I took a parallel computing class in Julia. I don't think Julia is a very popular programming language anymore. Am I very sad that I took the class? No. The principles of parallel computing are still very useful, I would say, today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
So what I'm hearing is, skills that you still want to build, whether it's computer science or maybe some version of computer science, is kind of building the mental model of how computers and systems work.

Varun Mohan (00:21:12):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):
Parallel processing, memory, hard drives, internet, things like that. And then there's just problem solving skills, being able to solve interesting problems. Is there any other skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:21:37):
I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit undervalued is this kind of agency piece. And I think about this a lot, which is, you have a lot of people that could go through college and go through school and they're basically told exactly what to do on a P-set. They're given these very, very, I would say, well-defined paths that they need to take. I think maybe in society and just school, we don't prioritize how do you make sure you get people with real agency that want to build something, right? Their goal is not just to maybe graduate from college and then get a job at a big tech company where they're told exactly what to do or where to put the pixel for this one website. I think that's maybe a skill set that is undervalued just right now, probably in the last maybe 10 years or so. And I think that's going to be really, really important.

(00:22:27):
For a startup, obviously these are skills that we just look for. We look for people that are really high agency because we just recognize that by default, if we don't innovate and do crazy things, we're going to die. The company is just going to die. So we just look for this, right? But I would say for most software engineering jobs, that's probably not the case. Just think about big company X and what they're hiring for on the average software engineering interview. It probably doesn't look like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:52):
I love how you phrased that. If we don't do crazy things and innovate, we're going to die. That would be a great title for this podcast episode. And I think, I know, it's 100% true. There's just a lot of crazy things happening and a lot of innovation happening. And if you can't keep up, you'll die.

(00:23:07):
So let's talk about hiring. You have a really interesting approach to hiring. There's a few questions I have here. One is just how do you... I know you try to stay really lean. That's a common theme across all the AI startups these days. How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:23:22):
I love the idea of being a lean company, but I don't idolize it in the way that, "Hey, it is a dream to be a 10% or 20% company that's making 50, 100, 200 million in revenue." That's not, I think, what we idolize inside the company.

(00:23:36):
I think what we idolize is, be the smallest company we can be to satisfy our ambitions. That's what the goal is. And maybe, Lenny, the way I would sort of put that out there is, if I told you, "Hey, I'm going to build an autonomous vehicle," and I said our team is 10 people, you should rightfully say, "Hey Varun, you're not serious. And you'd be right. I'm not serious at that point. So I think the answer is, what is the minimum number of people to go out and build the crazy ambition project that you have?

(00:24:04):
And I think the project we are trying to go out and do, which is completely transform the way software gets built, we've mentioned this [inaudible 00:24:11] the company, our goal is to reduce the time it takes to build apps and technology by 99%, right? It is a tremendously sort of ambitious goal. And it's not possible for us to be a 10, 20, 30, 40 person engineering team in the long term and actually satisfy that goal. We think there's a very, very high ceiling. So that's maybe the first key piece there. It's like, if we can crack actually being a fairly sizable company but still operate as if we're a startup, that's the dream. That's the dream.

(00:24:40):
In terms of hiring philosophy, the way we sort of think about things is, we only hire for a role if we're actually underwater for that function. So let's say we're going out and building inference technology. Unless we're underwater there, we will not go out and hire someone to go out and work for that. And the reason for that is, I actually think this is a feature. When you hire for a role and you already have enough people there, you get a lot of weird politics that ultimately ends up happening. And it's not because people are bad people. I think most people are really well-intentioned. But what happens when you have people that join a company and in reality you didn't really need them? They will go out and manufacture some other thing that they should go work on. They will go out and figure out something else to work on. And realistically, it's not that important, but they will go out and try to convince the rest of the organization that it is important.

(00:25:30):
I just think as a startup, we don't have the bandwidth to go out and deal with that, right? For me, I would like to see everyone just almost be raising their hands up being like, "I'm dying. We need one more person." And that's when we go out and hire someone. And one of the analogies I like to give is, I want the company to almost be this dehydrated entity and every hire is like a little bit of water. And we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):
I love this metaphor so much. And it sounds painful. It sounds painful that you need to be underwater and raising your hand, "I'm about to die and dehydrated." But I also know that it's a really exciting way to work. It sounds hard, but if you're in it, it's just like... I guess talk about just that side of it because I think it could sound like, "This is terrible. I don't want to work this way."

Varun Mohan (00:26:19):
You know what I actually think, Lenny? It's really good for a handful of reasons, which is that a lot of the... We respect and trust the people that work at the company. So this forces ruthless prioritization. You have a team that's going out and doing something. They will never ask to work on something that's not important. In fact, if there are two things that they're working on, they're just going to just tell me, "Hey, there are two things on my plate. I just don't have the ability to do two. I can only do one." And they will pick the one that's most important.

(00:26:45):
And this actually goes back to one thing that I think is true about startups and just companies in general. You don't win by doing 10 things well. You win by doing one thing really well and maybe you fail nine things. This is the thing that I've told the company, "This is very different than school," right? In school you optimize for your total GPA. But for companies, I just need to get an A+ on the one class that matters. And then I can get an F in all the other classes. And an F in all the other classes doesn't mean just doing illegal things. That basically means you just deprioritize things that don't matter. That actually forces this organizational prioritization that is just really, really good.

(00:27:22):
And Douglas and I, Douglas being my co-founder, we can tell the company, "These are the two things that are the most important." But if we go out and tell these are the two things that are the most important to the company and then we put the company has 20% more people than necessary, what's going to ultimately happen? It's almost a forcing function for ruthless prioritization to have fewer people or people that are just underwater internally at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:46):
Everyone listening that works at a big company knows exactly what you mean when you described when there's just too many people, they will all find work to do and they will all be pitching ideas. They all want to show impact, they want to do well in their performance reviews. That's just the nature of too many people at a company. And so I think this all really resonates.

(00:28:04):
To even getting even deeper on just what it looks like when someone's underwater to tell you it's time to hire, is it just someone coming to you, "Varun, I need someone on this team. This is just not possible"? What does that look like even more practically?

Varun Mohan (00:28:16):
Yeah, I think it's basically along those lines. It's that, "Hey, there's some pressure to get something done in a short period of time." By the way, one of the things that we do believe though for software, if you want to do great things, it's not possible to just say, "Hey, I want to get it done in one month" if it is like... Because you have to think about it from this perspective. If a software project could get built in two to three weeks, what does that really mean about the true complexity and differentiation of what you built? It's probably not very high, unless you believe you are way smarter than everyone else. But I think that's hubris, right? I think we actually have a very exceptional engineering team. But also at the same time, I don't think our engineering team is so exceptional that we can do things in three weeks that the rest of the world can't do in six to nine months. That's kind of stupid to believe that.

(00:28:57):
So I think basically it comes down to that person coming out and being like, "Hey, look, I don't have enough time to do X." Us having a conversation to be like, "Okay, what can you do then?" And if the answer is, "I can only do less than that," then maybe we make a decision actually, "Oh wow, that's great. Maybe we actually should deprioritize Y." Because this is actually also another thing that's very hard even for people like me and my co-founder. It's that we also want to do a lot of things. There's an urge to do a lot of things. But if we are forced to make a decision constantly on like, "We cannot do X," it's very clarifying. It's very clarifying because our engineering interview process is also extremely low acceptance rate. So it's not very easy for us to very quickly spin up people and have them join the company really, really quickly either.

(00:29:43):
So I think it's clarifying for everyone. It's clarifying for the person that wants more people. We can just tell them, "Hey look, we don't believe you should be doing this other thing." And it's also clarifying for us because we can also get on the same page with them. And sometimes we just kind of agree, "Hey..." Our teams are very flexible that, "Hey, actually we do need to get something done." And one of the things that we've kind of tried to make sure is true on our engineering team is, people's value to the company does not have anything to do with the size of their team. There are projects inside the company, there are directly responsible individuals for these projects inside the company. And if we feel like one project is very important, then people can move from one project to the next.

(00:30:21):
There's no notion of someone owning people at the company. That is a very bad and gnarly idea. In fact, the person that is the most valuable at the company is the person that can do the most crazy sort of project out there with as few people as possible. And that's what you should be rewarding internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
How many people do you have at coding at this point?

Varun Mohan (00:30:37):
So we have close to 160 people and the engineering team is over 50 people right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
Awesome. Oh, what's the other bigger functions? So [inaudible 00:30:46]-

Varun Mohan (00:30:46):
We have go-to-market. We have a... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):
Oh, right. Okay. I want to talk about that, the sales learning that you guys had. Okay. But let's close out this hiring conversation. So we talked about what you look for... To tell you it's the time to hire, what do you look for in the people that you interview and hire?

Varun Mohan (00:31:01):
One of the key pieces that we look for, we have a very high technical bar. So assuming that they actually meet the technical bar, I think we sort of look for people that are really, really passionate about the mission of what we're actually trying to solve and people that are willing to work very hard. I think one of the things that we don't try to do is convince people, "Hey look, we are a very chill company and it's great to work here." I think, no, this is a very exciting space. It's very competitive. You should expect us to lose if the people at the company are not kind of... They're not working very hard. And I think one of the biggest dog whistles I hear is, when I ask people how hard are you willing to work, some people actually ultimately say, "Hey, I work very smart." And I basically ask them a question, "If we have many smart people at our company that also work hard, what's the differentiator going to be? Are you just going to pull them down?"

(00:31:48):
Because I think one of the things that's true about companies is it's like this massive group project. And I think the thing about a person that is not pulling their weight that's bad. It's not the productivity, right? At some point when the company becomes many hundreds of engineers, I'm not going to be thinking about the one engineer that's not pulling their weight. It's the team of people they work with that are almost basically saying, "Is this the bar internally at the company? Is this the expectation?" And I guess, Lenny, if I told you you have a team of five people and the four other people you're working with just don't care, how much are you going to feel like you should care?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:21):
Not too much.

Varun Mohan (00:32:22):
Exactly. So for us, I think that's what we more care about. We have a culture where it's very collaborative. It's not an individual sport, but people feel like they can rely on other people to get complex sort of tasks done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:35):
So the question you asked there just basically is, how hard are you willing to work? How hard do you want to work? And I know some people, there's this whole group of folks that are just like work-life balance, "How dare you ask me to work crazy hours?" And I love just the filter upfront of, "If you work here, you will work really hard. You'll work a lot of hours. It's a crazy space to be in. And we will win by working smart and also really hard."

Varun Mohan (00:33:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
You said at some point earlier that your engineering pass rate, as you said, it was like 0.6% of candidates, something like that.

Varun Mohan (00:33:10):
Yeah, it's probably post or take home. It's probably that actually. So the take home itself filters probably another 10, 15X on top of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
Here's a question that I've been hearing more and more, is just, how do you do interviews these days with tools like Windsurf out there that solve all your problems?

Varun Mohan (00:33:25):
We are okay with people using the tools because I think one of the worst things is like, if someone comes here and doesn't like using these tools, we believe there are massive productivity improvements. We do bring people into the company on site so we can actually see how they think through problems on a whiteboard and all these other pieces. So we do want to see how they think on their feet and hopefully they're not just taking what we're saying, putting it in a voice translator and sticking it into ChatGPT and getting the answer out.

(00:33:51):
So there is a way to do this. My viewpoint on this is the tools are really, really important, but I do think we still look for some problem solving ability. If the only way you can solve a hard problem is put it into ChatGPT, I think that's a concern to us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:34:22):
Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab.

(00:34:54):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time.

That's C-O-D-A, .io/lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan. coda.io/lenny.

(00:35:24):
Okay. Let's talk about this go-to-market sales experience that you guys had. So you started obviously like most people, started building without sales team. And then you realized, from what I hear, that that was a huge miss and a big opportunity to talk about there because that's really unique, I think, that you guys have a large sales team and go-to-market team.

Varun Mohan (00:35:40):
Yeah, we actually made this decision pretty early in the company's history, I would say. We hired our VP of sales over a year ago actually. And the go-to-market team is now over 80 people inside the company. So it's a pretty sizable function inside the company.

(00:35:55):
Yeah. Maybe a little bit of a backstory here. So when we started the company, actually we had a handful of angels that actually were operators, go-to-market operators. So an example of one was Carlos Delatorre who used to be the CRO of MongoDB. And I think for us, we never viewed enterprise sales and sales as a very negative thing. I think this is a interesting thing that technical founders sometimes don't really like. They think sales is a very negative part of the process. Everything should be product-led growth. I think it's not that black and white. I think enterprise sales is really valuable. But maybe when we were a GPU virtualization company and we were an infrastructure company, the reason why we never hired a salesperson is, I didn't know how to scale the function. I was the one who was selling the product.

(00:36:37):
So ultimately speaking, if it was hard for me to sell the product incrementally, I didn't know how we could make that into a process that we could then go and scale. I didn't know how we could take the revenue of the business from a couple million to hundreds of millions and let alone even tenths. So if I didn't know how to do that, how could I go out and hire someone and make them scale it out?

(00:36:58):
On the other hand, for Codeium, very quickly, a lot of large enterprises reached out to us. And from that alone in the middle of 2023, we started, I guess, me and a handful of other folks at the company started selling the product and we were doing tens of pilots concurrently with large enterprises and we were very quickly able to understand that there was a large enterprise motion that needed to be built in this space. So by the end of 2023, we actually hired our VP of sales. And very quickly after that, scaled our sales team. Yeah, I mean look, if you want to sell to the Fortune 500, it is very hard to do that purely by swiping a credit card.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
Let's talk about Cursor. I don't want to spend too much time with competitors, but that's what everyone's always thinking about when they think of you guys. You guys are kind of the leading players, I think, in the space also. There's Copilot, but that's different.

(00:37:46):
So what's the simplest way to understand how you guys are different from Cursor and also just how you think you win in the space long-term?

Varun Mohan (00:37:53):
So I think maybe a handful of things that I could share. So on the product side, I think we've invested a lot in making sure code-based understanding for very large code bases is really high quality. And that's just because of where we started. We worked with some of the worlds are just companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. Companies like Dell have singular code bases that are over 100 million lines of code. So being able to understand that really, really quickly to make large scale changes is something that we've spent a lot of time doing. And that requires us actually building our own models that can consume large chunks of their code base in parallel across thousands of GPUs and almost rank them to be able to find out what the most important snippets of code are for any question that are asked about the code base. So we've gone out and built large distributed systems based on our infrastructure background to go ahead and do that. That's maybe one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):
Let me actually follow that thread because I think people may underestimate just how big of a deal that is. So when we talk about, we had the founders of Bolt and Lovable on the podcast, so those products, they build something from scratch, they built, they write the code for you. So that versus just loading, say, Windsurf on your million line code base, say, at Airbnb or Uber. Like, understanding what the hell you have and how it works and where to go change things without breaking it is insanely hard. And so what I'm hearing is that's kind of a big differentiator as you guys started there actually. And then Windsurf is now building up that advantage.

Varun Mohan (00:39:15):
That's right. Yeah. So that's a big thing that we spent a lot of time on, which is just understanding what the code base is doing. And actually one of the other things is, what are all the user interactions with respect to the code base? And happy to show that also in a bit here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Awesome.

Varun Mohan (00:39:31):
The second key piece probably is we're not only tied to Windsurf actually. This is probably a weird statement given even we are talking about Windsurf, which is that actually we're pretty focused on supporting IDEs like JetBrains. JetBrains or IntelliJ has over 70 to 80% of all Java developers coding in JetBrains based IDEs, right? The reason why we don't feel as big a need to almost build a competing product to JetBrains is JetBrains is actually a very sort of extensible product in a way that VSCode is not. VSCode is not very extensible.

(00:40:05):
So I think for us, our goal here is not only just to satisfy a subset of users that can actually switch onto our IDE, but we want to give this agentic sort of experience to every sort of developer out there. And if that means there are Java developers that write in JetBrains, that's fine. We work with a lot of large enterprises that have 10 plus thousand developers where over 50% of the developers are on JetBrains. It's a very large product. And by the way, that company itself is a privately held company that makes many hundreds of millions of dollars a year. So it's a very, very large company. So for us, that's another key piece. We actually want to meet developers sort of where they are. And if they use a different platform, we'll work on that too.

(00:40:42):
The third key piece, and this probably sounds another key piece for enterprises, is we work in a lot of very secure environments. We have FedRAMP compliance, which means we can sell to very large government entities. We have a hybrid mode of actually using the product, which means that all the code that lives that is indexed, it actually lives on the tenant of the user, right? Code is one of the most important pieces of IP for the company. So I think just if you were to look at it from a big company perspective, there are many reasons why over the years of just building an enterprise product, we've handled a lot of complexities that large companies want to see. But that's part of it is because of the history of how we got here in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
Okay, Varun, enough teasing. Let's do a live demo of Windsurf so folks can see what it's like. And then I'm just going to ask you a bunch of questions as we're going through it. So I'll let you pull up a little shared screen where you have Windsurf pulled up.

Varun Mohan (00:41:33):
Great. So some context, this is a very basic React project. There's nothing in it right now. So if you were to open any sort of file, it's the default React app project. I have this basic image here. You can pass Windsurf images of what you'd like the project to look like, of what I would like an Airbnb for dog's website to kind of look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:55):
Beautiful. Beautiful mock-up by the way. I love that this is like all you need.

Varun Mohan (00:41:59):
This is all you need. This is all you need. So basically what we're going to do is we're going to say, "Hey..." One of the cool parts about Windsurf is it can actually work in an existing project already. So I can basically say, "Hey, change this React app to show an Airbnb for dog's website based on this image and preview it."

(00:42:25):
So now it'll just go out and start executing code, reading through the repository. Obviously, it doesn't know what the current code base actually looks like. And it'll go out and analyze the code base to actually find out the set of changes necessary. So we'll go out and wait and see what it's going to do. But while we're doing that, let's continue the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
Awesome. Okay, so first of all, so you open up Windsurf. You had a boilerplate React project ready to go. And Windsurf had never really seen this code before. You ask it to do stuff on your code base, which is just like, "Change this to Airbnb for dogs using this design." Amazing.

Varun Mohan (00:43:03):
That's right. That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Yeah. Okay, cool. So we'll let it run and we'll talk. Let me ask you this question that I've been asking everyone that comes on that is building a product that helps engineers build products and product managers build products and designers.

(00:43:15):
Say you could sit next to every single new user that opens up Windsurf and whisper a couple tips in their ear to help them be successful with the product. What would be a couple tips you'd share?

Varun Mohan (00:43:25):
Tip number one is just be a little bit patient and both patient and explicit. When you ask the application to go out and make some changes, it could actually go out and make many irrelevant changes. One of the things that I think prevents this the most is just be really, really explicit or as explicit as possible. And one of the things I ask people to do is in the beginning, start by making smaller changes. If there's a very large directory, don't go out and make it refactor the entire directory because then if it's wrong, it's going to basically it destroy 20 files.

(00:44:00):
And I think from there, one of the key pieces I think that comes from the users that use the product is they sort of learn what the hills and valleys of the product are. The analogy I like to give are kind of similar to autocomplete. When you use a product like autocomplete, you would think a product that is suggesting things but only getting accepted 30% of the time would be really, really annoying. But the reason why it's not very annoying is actually because you've actually learned that, hey, 70% of the time, I don't need to accept this. And the times that I do, I know to get value from it. And you also know beforehand if a sort of command that you write is very complex, you just expect, "Hey, the autocomplete is not going to work for it." So I think it's almost like a, understand what the hills and valleys of the product are.

(00:44:45):
The crazy thing is, every three months that kind of gets changed and reevaluated. It almost becomes the case that it becomes materially better than it was in the past. So I think maybe patience and being explicit are maybe the two important key pieces I would tell users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):
And I think something that was kind of between the lines there is get a gut feeling of what the model is capable of, like how specific to be versus how abstract it can be. And there's kind of this gut feeling you start to build over time.

Varun Mohan (00:45:12):
That's right. Yeah. And with that, it feels like we have an actual preview. Guess what? We have a nice-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
Cute dogs.

Varun Mohan (00:45:21):
A nice dog app. And one of the cool parts is that we've also done beyond just modifying code is actually being able to point to different pieces. And I guess I could just kind of say... I could point to different elements and say, "Hey, make the background..." This is not great design, but I could basically say, if I took this element, "Make this background red and just take a particular element and just change it and make it red." And it should go out and be able to go out and do this.

(00:45:52):
The preview aspect of the product of being able to showcase the app while it's getting built helps in that, now actually you can live entirely in app world. You don't even maybe even need to look at the code. Granted this looks hideous, but in some ways if I wanted to, I could go out and do that, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:09):
This is what happens when there's no more designers. Like, [inaudible 00:46:11].

Varun Mohan (00:46:11):
Yeah. When there's no more designers. Sure. Maybe the answer is like, when you ask me what should people be doing, they should study great taste. Having great taste. Because I think taste is also a very, very hard, right?

(00:46:22):
But maybe the other key piece, Lenny, that I wanted to showcase here is obviously you could keep going here. I could take different components and kind of change them. We have a lot of plans here that are beyond just point and click changing components. But one of the cool pieces is the AI. There's an AI review flow as well, which is kind of like what I was saying. The goal of AI has now changed a lot in that it is now modifying large chunks of code for you. And the job of a developer now is to actually review a lot of the code that the AI has generated. And granted right now during this podcast, I'm not going to review all the code that's getting generated.

(00:46:57):
But let's say I want to go out and modify some of this code. And this is where if you're an actual developer that actually wants to go modify, maybe I don't like my variable name being called title. I want it to be called Title String instead, like this. And if I wanted to go out and make that change and change to go out and say Title String and that's what I'm going to do, I'm just going to tell the AI to continue.

(00:47:18):
The cool part about this is Windsurf not only knows about what the agent has done. It also knows everything that the user has done. Our goal here is to have this almost flow-like state where everything the user has done, the AI also knows. And it is able to predict the intent. And as you can see, it said, "I noticed that the interface property title was changed to Title String." And then it now has gone out and modified all the locations within the app from title to Title String. And now it no longer says that.

(00:47:45):
So this is where even if I'm writing software and I want to go and make point changes, the AI can go out and quickly make these changes on the user's path. Imagine doing a refactor or a migration and you just change one part of the code. You can just tell the AI to continue the rest. And because it deeply understands the code base, it should go out and find all the corresponding places to go out and make the change. And obviously now when I reload my app, there's no bug in the app. It still loads properly. I could obviously tell it to do even cooler things like make the app retro. I don't know what that means, but I guess I could do that. And it should go out and make the change correspondingly for me.

(00:48:23):
But yeah, that's maybe the high level parts there where the AI is not only able to operate entirely in app space but also on the code space of the users going out and modifying code and to bridge the gap between the two. So it should add leverage not only non-developers that are just purely building apps, but also developers that are just hands-on keyboard too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):
Amazing. By the way, if you're not on YouTube, you can't see, but you can just select any element of the page and then reference that in your ask of, "Here's what I want changed." I didn't know that was a feature. And that is extremely cool.

(00:48:57):
So interestingly, so having just looked at Lovable and Bolt and Replit and apps like that, it's basically doing all the things those apps do. Oh, wow. There's the retro version. That's good. I like that it built on your red and made it really nice actually.

Varun Mohan (00:49:11):
Actually the red looks way better now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):
Yeah, a little green button. This is great. Okay.

Varun Mohan (00:49:14):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
So I don't think people realize this, but apps like Windsurf, that it could actually do a lot of agentic work for you where you just tell it, "Here. I want you to do this" versus it's auto completing code for you.

(00:49:25):
The big difference is you need to start it with some code base so you have this kind of boilerplate React project. Is there a reason you guys aren't taking that step and just doing that automatically for you? Is it because you're targeting engineers and they don't need that or is there other reasons?

Varun Mohan (00:49:39):
Lenny, the interesting thing is the base app that you saw for this was also generated by Windsurf. The reason why we sort of didn't generate it is installing all the dependencies takes like three or four minutes. And for the demo, I didn't want to wait. But totally, actually most of the users of the product, probably zero-to-one build these apps.

(00:49:57):
And if I can say one interesting thing is, when we launched Windsurf, actually we tasked everyone at our company to go out and build an app with Windsurf. That included our go-to market team and our sales team. There was a crazy stat that I think people would find surprising, but we've saved over half a million dollars of SaaS products we were going to buy because our go-to-market team has now built apps instead of buying them. Our head of partnerships, instead of buying a partner portal product, has actually built its own partner portal. He had never built software in the past. We've actually come up with ways inside the company to deploy these apps easily in a secure way. And we're actually now building very, very custom software for our company to operate more efficiently, which is, I would not have expected this probably six months ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:44):
That is incredibly interesting. You don't need to name company names, but I guess what's a space you're least bullish on that you think is going to have the most problem here with people building their own version of these sorts of products?

Varun Mohan (00:50:56):
I think maybe my viewpoint are these very, very verticalized niche products I think are going to get... They're going to get competed down a ton. And I think sales products are an example of one of these things. And maybe this is a... I don't want to be very negative, but it's very hard inside a company like ours to task our best engineers to build a best in class sales product. There's not enough interest to do that. Or to build a best in class legal software product or finance software product. It's very, very hard for us to. And actually that's a very big moat for these companies that built these products that they were able to come out, have an opinionated stance on how to do this, hire good enough engineers to go out and build the software. Our company is unwilling to do that. So previously, we would go out and buy the technology because there would be no alternative.

(00:51:48):
But now one of the crazy things is that the domain specialists now have access to build the tools that they ultimately wanted, which is actually crazy. If you think about why were these software companies able to exist these vertical software companies, the reason is because they had many features. The kitchen sink of features worked for a lot of companies, but each individual company only wanted 10% of the features. But the problem is, each individual company was not capable of maintaining a piece of software or building the custom piece of software for 10% of the features, but that has now changed entirely. Now they can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:22):
Yeah. There's always been a story of like, "Why would I spend any time building my own software if I could just..." But now it's like five minutes of time.

Varun Mohan (00:52:29):
Five minutes and maybe even more custom to your system. How many times have you bought a software and you're almost like, "Why is there no integration to X? And I actually use X." How annoying is that? That actually makes the software less useful to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):
So I think what's cool is when you go back, if someone zooms back to the beginning of when you started the demo, it's basically a PM talking to an engineer, "Hey, build me a Airbnb for dogs. Here's a stupid mock that I made with some boxes." That's almost like a bad PM talking to an engineer and it just actually works. That's what's insane about this. And so that's why this example you're sharing of go-to-market folks, building their own things, it's like they don't need to know anything about product building. It's just describe it in some ridiculous way and draw a couple boxes of what you want it to look like and it makes something for you.

Varun Mohan (00:53:20):
Which shows that agency is what matters. If you have a product manager that has an idea, there's no reason for why that idea cannot be more well fleshed out. How many times do you have a product manager that just continualize ideas, but it just feels like they are extremely unsure on how to execute on it? They just want to say things for sake of saying things? But for the people that have ideas and a lot of, I guess, agency, they can go out and prove out what they want without any sort of external resources.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):
I think even more acutely for product folks listening to this, it's the salesperson coming to you being like, "Hey, I want this thing. It's going to help me with my sales team." And you're like, "I don't have a million things to build. I don't have time for this." And so that problem goes away, which I think will make a lot of product leaders really happy.

(00:54:04):
The model that this is sitting on, is it Sonnet?

Varun Mohan (00:54:08):
Yeah. So just to break down how it ultimately works, we have a model that does planning. And I would say right now Sonnet is a really, really good planning model. I think OpenAI's GPT-4o is also good. But the crazy thing is what we try to do is we try to make the Anthropic based model or Sonnet model try to do as much of the high level planning as possible. And then what we try to do internally is run all the models necessary to do high quality retrieval for the agent. As you could see, the agent needed to understand what the rest of the code base ultimately did. We actually make sure we run models to actually chunk up the entire code base and understand the code base so that obviously it would not be a good idea if we had a 100 million line code base to send that entire code base to Anthropic.

(00:54:49):
First of all, you couldn't do that. That's over 1.5 billion tokens of code. So obviously that would be three or four orders of my actually larger than the largest context lens right now.

(00:54:58):
But you also wouldn't want to do that from a cost and latency standpoint too. So that's one. And the second piece that you saw was the model is able to very quickly make edits to the software as well. We have custom models that we built that are post trained on top of popular open source models that can make these edits really, really quickly to the code base. And the reason why you would want to do that is it's A, faster, and B, also that model can actually have more of the code base in context too. So it can be better at applying changes than even Anthropics model too.

(00:55:28):
So I think the way we like to think about it is, our only goal is how do we build the best product possible? How do we build the best product possible and how do we make the ceiling as high as possible? And we will go out and build models and train models wherever necessary. But if we're not going to be good at a task and we think the open source is better or Anthropic's better, we'll go and just use the open source or Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):
And so the models you guys are building, those are built on open source models that people are releasing?

Varun Mohan (00:55:51):
Yeah. Interestingly, the one that does retrieval is actually completely pre-trained in-house that actually does that. But yeah, for a lot of different pieces, it's based on open source. Interestingly for the one that does the edits and auto-complete, that is also in-house. As you're typing, we actually do some auto-complete related stuff. I'm happy to show that, but I think a lot of users are familiar with that capability. So I think the way we like to look at it is like, what could we be best at and we will go out and trade. But if we're not going to be best at it, we should not just, for the sake of ego, go out and trade something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):
This may be getting too technical, but just, is there anything interesting around what you train on?

Varun Mohan (00:56:27):
Yeah, so one of the interesting things that we have from our users, and this is where we try to think like, "Why would we be any better?" is that, actually every hour, we get probably tens of millions of pieces of feedback from our users. We get a lot of feedback on what they like and what they don't like. For something like autocomplete, we get a lot of preference data, a lot of preference data. And the preference data is weird. It doesn't look like data that you find on the internet. It's like data as the user is typing. Imagine you're typing some code in a code base, the code's going to be incomplete as you're typing it, right? It's not going to be in a full-fledged form. It's not like it is on GitHub. But we have a lot of data that looks like this.

(00:57:06):
So we are uniquely well-positioned to actually build a good model that can complete code even when it's in an incomplete state when the models that are out there, the frontier models have consumed very little code that looks like this. So for that case we're like, "Hey, we can go out and do a much better job potentially." And we'll go out and train models on all the preference data we have.

(00:57:25):
The same is kind of true on retrieval, right? There's a way to find out, are we retrieving the right data? Did the user accept the code change after that? Was the retrieval actually a good retrieval a signal that we can get? So basically the way we like to look at it is, if something is just purely code planning, there's not a great reason why we would be the best at that. I can't come up with a coherent argument for that. But for something that looks more along the lines of, "Hey, here's an intermediate code base that is very gnarly and here are some changes that need to get made" and we know the evolution of the code or we've seen the evolution of code across millions of users, we feel like we can do a great job of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):
I think what's interesting about this is another differentiator/moat for companies that end up winning in this space, is you just have more and more of that data than other companies if you're ahead.

Varun Mohan (00:58:14):
Yeah. This is sort of why maybe at a high level we like the zero-to-one app building product space. I think it's really... It's a good product space. But ultimately I think it needs to boil down to you understanding the code, because otherwise, you're living at too high a plane where it's not clear why you would be able to be the best at that compared to everyone else. It's not really clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:35):
As a company, you mean?

Varun Mohan (00:58:36):
As a company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
Versus as a user.

Varun Mohan (00:58:37):
It feels like it might get competitive in a way that it's not clear where you would continue to differentiate over and over with time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
I see. Because if they're just sitting on top of Sonnet and just doing what every other Sonnet wrapper is doing, there's not a lot of differentiation or moat.

Varun Mohan (00:58:54):
It depends on how you do it. But maybe if I was to say this, if the inputs you're consuming are just web elements, extremely high level web elements, then the interface might be high level enough that it's hard to maybe get better than maybe what the frontier models are doing just across the board. You are just better off just plugging in Sonnet for everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
Got it. Awesome. One thing I wanted to come back to that I wrote down that I think is really important for people to understand, you talked about how with Windsurf it's not necessarily... There's a boilerplate code base that you want to start with because it's actually... Because it's not an abstracted zero-to-one app builder. It's an actual IDE you're coding in. And you talked about how has to install dependencies, which is kind this painful thing. And the reason it has to do that is because running locally on your machine versus in the cloud, like, say, Lovable and Replit and all these guys, although I think Bolt runs in your browser in this really cool way.

(00:59:47):
So that's an important distinction. This is like you're running this locally in your machine and has all the libraries you need to actually run it.

Varun Mohan (00:59:54):
No, I think that's important. I think we believe a lot of people sort of build software in what are called code spaces and things in a remote machine. I just think it's that a lot of developers like building locally for what you said. Like if you're doing things that are more than just full stack applications, you might have dependencies on your machine that are just system dependencies that are just gnarly to install. Let's imagine you're building a GPU-based application and the Nvidia drivers, they're necessary. You just want to give people the flexibility to build where they can build. And I think the IDE and building locally has been a thing that people have done for decades, so probably it's not going to go away in the next couple of years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):
I love that your sales folks now are running local host servers.

Varun Mohan (01:00:34):
Well, with the browser previews, it's easier, right? You kind of just open it up on the side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Okay. I have a few more questions just about how you think and operate at Codeium. So you guys are kind of at the forefront of how product teams are going to operate. You're seeing the future every day. And so I'm curious if there's ways you guys have structured your teams, engineers, product design that might be different from how other companies are doing it or have tried stuff that has worked really well or tried stuff that's a huge disaster?

Varun Mohan (01:01:02):
One interesting decision that we kind of have for core engineering is that we don't have pure product managers for the core engineering side of the company. And by the way, that's purely because we build for developers and our product is built by developers. So I think the intuition from our own developers is hopefully valuable. If not, we might be hiring the wrong type of people. So I think our developers are, in some sense, flexing to be more product conventional product managers.

(01:01:32):
Now on the other hand, if we were building something that looked more like Uber or the persona was very different and we didn't ourselves understand it, I think the organization wouldn't look the way it looks.

(01:01:42):
For the enterprise side of the company, because we do work with a lot of large enterprises where the requirements are not something that our engineers would automatically understand, I don't think our engineers wake up and they're like, "We need FedRAMP." This is probably something that a lot of customers come to us with and tell us. We have people that flex in this product strategy role that understand what the customer wants and understands the technical capabilities that we have to best build a product that would help them at scale.

(01:02:12):
So I think we have an interesting organization in this regard, but mostly I would say because we are a developer-based product, I would say that's true.

(01:02:21):
And then also kind of like what you said for the engineering team itself, the team structure is, it's fairly flat. We try to go with two pizza teams, teams that are fairly small just because I think the problem is when a team gets too big, the person leading the team is no longer able to get in the weeds of the technology itself. And I think in a space that's moving this quickly, I think it's dangerous to have leaders that don't understand the technology deeply and are not building. It's very, very dangerous because there's too much armchair quarterbacking. And so I think that's maybe one other decision we made.

(01:02:56):
And then teams are very, very flexible. So if we decide something is a new priority, we're very quick to change the way a team looks. And it's very centrally planned in this regard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:08):
The two pizza team concept, I saw a tweet long ago where someone from India, was like, there's always talk about two pizza teams, but pizzas in India are much smaller. And so the teams end up being smaller and they're like, "Why can't we build as much of these teams in the US?"

Varun Mohan (01:03:22):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:23):
Okay. So how many PMs do you have? So you said you have 150 employees, something like that?

Varun Mohan (01:03:28):
Yeah. So in terms of the product strategy function, we have three people in that role right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):
I see. So it's like product... They're in their titles is product strategy, not necessarily product management?

Varun Mohan (01:03:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
Interesting. And then 50 engineers, you said 80-ish sales folks?

Varun Mohan (01:03:45):
Yes, that's right. And then obviously we have functions like recruiting parts of G&A, like finance. We have marketing at the company. So some other functions internally as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):
It's interesting. And this is something that you hear all the time with companies like Dario for example, from Anthropic talking about how 90% of code is going to be written by AI. But all at the same time, all you guys are hiring engineers like crazy.

Varun Mohan (01:04:08):
Yeah. Is that contradictory?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):
It's that contradictory, will there be an inflection point of like, "All right. Now we don't need them anymore."

Varun Mohan (01:04:15):
I think it really comes down to, do you get incremental value by adding more engineers internally? I'm going to take... First of all, maybe just to set the record straight, if AI is writing over 90% of the code, that doesn't mean engineers are 10X as productive. Engineers spend more time than just writing code. The review code, test code, debug code, design code, deploy code, right? Navigate code. There's probably a lot of different things that engineers do. There's this one famous law in parallel computing, it's called Amdahl's Law. I don't know if you've heard about it. But it basically says if you have a graph of tasks and you have this critical path and you take any one task and parallelize it a ton, which is make it almost take zero amount of time, there's still a limit of the amount of how much faster it made the whole process go.

(01:04:56):
So maybe put simply, let's say you have 100 units of time and only 30 units of time is being spent writing software and I took the 30 and made it three, I only took the 100 and made it 73. It's only a 27% improvement in the grand scheme of things.

(01:05:09):
So I think look, we are definitely seeing over 30, maybe close to 40% productivity improvements. But I think for the vision that we're solving for, even if I were to say the company in the long tail had 200 engineers, it'd probably be too low still at that point. So the question is, how much more productivity do you get per person? Actually, maybe just to even say one of those thing for some of these large companies, let's say you took the CIO of a company like JPMorgan Chase, right? Her budget on software every year is $17 billion and there's over 50,000 engineers inside the company and you told her, "Hey, each of these engineers are now able to produce more technology." That's effectively what you've done, right? The right calculus that JPMorgan Chase or any of these companies will make is the ROI of building technology has actually gone up. So the opportunity cost of not investing more into technology has gone up, which means that you should just invest even more. And maybe in the short term you have even more engineers, right?

(01:06:08):
Now, that's not true across the board. There are some companies that are happy with the amount of technology they're building and there's a ceiling on the amount of technology they want to build. But for companies that actually have a very high technology ceiling, this doesn't mean you stop. This actually means you hire more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:22):
This is a great bull case for engineers. I feel like the canary in the coal mine for the engineering profession is when companies like yours slow down on hiring engineers.

Varun Mohan (01:06:30):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:31):
That's not happening.

Varun Mohan (01:06:32):
[inaudible 01:06:32]. It seems like Anthropic is also hiring a lot to get it done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:35):
Yeah. Everyone is. So I think that's really promising. I think if you're in college still, makes sense to get into engineering at this point.

(01:06:40):
Okay. Let me ask you this question as kind of a final question maybe. What's maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned about building AI products, building Windsurf and just being in a space?

Varun Mohan (01:06:54):
I think one of the weird things is online, everyone is very excited about the short-term wins that we are making, right? Like what we're putting out maybe weekly. We do these waves every couple of weeks. But actually a lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks, maybe three, six months, nine months away. That's what we're working on internally. Because I think this is kind of, Lenny, what I was mentioning to you before. One of the goals that I tell everyone at our company is we should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of our existing product look dumb.

(01:07:31):
So there's this weird tension where you want to have a product in market and you want to incrementally iterate and listen to users and keep making it better and better. But I would say we were the first identical IDE product out there. That's what we landed with. And I think the value of that is going to depreciate very quickly unless we continue to re-prove ourselves. And we will need to re-prove ourselves in ways in which our users are not even asking. So there's this tension here, where incremental feels very safe, right? Add this one more button. Users say, "Hey, I would like to be able to have this drop down to do X." But that is not the reason why we're going to win. That's almost table sticks. Yeah, we'll decide to do some of these. We might not decide to do a lot of these things. But it's these longer term efforts inside the company that almost disrupt the existing product that are ultimately the reason why we're going to succeed.

(01:08:21):
It's this weird tension that you need to have in your head of, you can't also not listen to your users at all because they're the reason you exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
This reminds me of a recent podcast guest. We had Gara from captions on the podcast and he told us that he has two roadmaps. They have two roadmaps at the company. They have the real roadmap, like the typical roadmap based on feature requests and user feedback and data and things like that. And then they have the secret roadmap, which is completely not informed by users or data/ it's just them making bets on where they think the world is going.

Varun Mohan (01:08:52):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
And I love that he calls it the secret roadmap just to make it very mysterious and-

Varun Mohan (01:08:56):
That's smarts. That's very smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:57):
Okay. I have one more question. I apologize. What's one thing that you wish he had known before starting Codeium?

Varun Mohan (01:09:04):
Honestly, I wish I had... Maybe humility is the wrong term, but this idea of just being okay with being wrong faster. I always think about things on when we make decisions. Me and my co-founder, we always talk about it. We're almost like, "Hey, I wish we had made the decision to do this a couple months earlier." We always talk about this. And the weird thing is outside looking and everyone's like, "Wow, actually the decision was made at the right time." But in my head I'm always banging my head being like, "What if we had made it a couple months earlier?" I think part of that is I waxed poetically about like, "Oh, you need to be irrationally optimistic and uncompromisingly realistic." But it's very hard to do this in practice because you drink your own Kool-Aid too. Because if you're not drinking your own, you won't get up out of bed. The answer is already solved. It's not actually any of these startups. The answer is Microsoft is going to be the winner in any software category. Isn't that the answer? Just because of distribution, resources and capital, they're going to commoditize every space.

(01:10:06):
So I think in some ways this amount of just understanding that, hey, re-evaluate your hypotheses and get into an uncomfortable space way more frequently is something I need to remind myself even to this day. And probably something that I didn't know coming in and starting the company. We started the company at peak zero time. At that time, probably everything seemed like it was going to moon. And there was probably a lot of irrational confidence, I would say, that we shouldn't have had.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Varun, we covered so much ground. What an incredible conversation. I learned so much just sitting here listening and asking you questions. Is there anything else that you wanted to share I leave listeners with, any last piece of nuggets or wisdom before I let you go?

Varun Mohan (01:10:51):
To be honest, I could give predictions about the space. Probably most of them are going to be wrong. I think the best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. And I think one of the most obvious things that's going to happen is, in the next year, there will be a tremendous amount of alpha for anyone that is able to take maximum advantage of these tools. Just imagine how many of your coworkers just don't even know the existence of these tools, don't know what they can do and how much less productive they will be. And I would just say get your hands as dirty as possible, as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:24):
And when you say get your hands dirty, basically it's like download Windsurf, start coding. Ask it to build things for you.

Varun Mohan (01:11:29):
Yeah, build apps. Build apps. Start using it for maybe even making mocks, modifying your existing code base. There's probably ways in which you could be a force multiplier to your organization and ways in which they never even anticipated, right? Imagine if you were a product manager that could actually very quickly make edits to the code base and just start pushing changes yourself. You probably get a tremendous amount of respect from your own engineering peers. You could probably get way more done because of that. I feel like there's no sort of ceiling at that point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
I think this is such an underestimated point you're making here. There's apps that can build things from scratch and then there's apps like this that can edit your existing code base if you're a PM at... What's the largest company you work with, people-wise?

Varun Mohan (01:12:15):
Publicly, let's just say JPMorgan Chase.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:16):
Okay.

Varun Mohan (01:12:19):
They have over 50,000 developers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
Okay. So you could be a PM at JPMorgan Chase and be like, "I have a problem I need to solve. I want to move this metric. I want to change the step in the signup flow." You just open up Windsurf and tell it to do the thing you want. And then can you push straight to GitHub and do a-

Varun Mohan (01:12:37):
Yeah. Actually, you could do that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
... merge [inaudible 01:12:39]-

Varun Mohan (01:12:39):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Okay. PR?

Varun Mohan (01:12:40):
Yeah, it could make a PR for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):
Oh, my God. This is insane. Folks, future is out of control. Okay. Man, that was such an important point at the end there because I think people may not realize this. They see all these other apps, they're like, "Oh, [inaudible 01:12:51], prototypes," but this is legitimately something a PM can actually do work with.

Varun Mohan (01:12:55):
Yeah. When you think about the people, at least that, I don't know, Lenny, who you respect the most, they're the people that somehow, despite their title, their level of agency and just output just all the way down to the weeds to the highest level strategy is just perfection, right? They know when to go all the way down. And I think sometimes you see people that talk about roles and they irrationally feel like, "Oh, because I'm this role, I'm not allowed to touch this." Well now everything's open season, right? And I think this is an opportunity to almost go all the way down to the weeds and all the way up to the top and just be effective on every level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):
Unbelievable. All right. Well with that, we'll leave folks. Varun, thank you so much for being here.

Varun Mohan (01:13:35):
Awesome. Thanks a lot, Lenny.

# An inside look at how Miro builds product | Varun Parmar (CPO of Miro)

## Transcript

Varun Parmar (00:00:00):
Every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you are either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Varun Parmar. Varun is chief product Officer at Miro, and prior to Miro, he was senior vice president and chief product officer at Box. As I share with Varun at the start of our chat, I've always been really curious about the product culture at Miro, partly because everyone I've ever met from Miro has been super interesting and super smart, and partly because they've been able to grow as a business and a product in an incredibly competitive market.

(00:01:07):
In our conversation, we get really deep into the product values and principles at Miro, their product development process, how Varun approaches competitive threats, how a bimonthly company-wide product demo ritual led to saving months of engineering work on a feature, plus insights into how Miro got started, how they grow today, and what their product team has learned about working with a large sales org. Varun is amazing, I learned a lot, and I hope you find it as interesting as I did. With that, I bring you Varun Parmar after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. While you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board.

(00:02:29):
With one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Varun Parmar (00:04:10):
Thank you, Lenny. So excited to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:13):
I'm really excited to have you here. I've been looking forward to having a chance to dig into Miro's product culture and the way Miro works for a while. We've actually had a few guests, ex-Miro... Mironeers, is that what you call yourselves?

Varun Parmar (00:04:25):
Yes, Mironeers.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Okay. Mironeers. So we had Elena Verna on the podcast, who's amazing, and Barbara who I think worked in marketing and everyone I've always met from Miro has been just really smart and really interesting and it just feels like you guys have a really interesting product culture that I haven't felt like has been shared a lot, and so I have a bunch of stuff I want to dig into there. One question I have at the bat, you guys have a really interesting history and specifically the way your company's structured, which is that you're collocated in Amsterdam and San Francisco. First of all, is that correct?

Varun Parmar (00:05:00):
The company is a global company, so we've got 12 different hubs. We have multiple offices in US, four different offices, and then multiple hubs in Europe as well, and presence in AsiaPac as well. I think by now we have a global footprint, yeah.

Lenny (00:05:17):
Got it. A question I wanted to ask off the bat is just how has that cross-cultural approach to product teams impacted the way that you guys built product and the way the company operates?

Varun Parmar (00:05:30):
The one thing that's really interesting, Lenny, around the way Miro is set up is that our product organization is actually based in Europe and our go-to-market organization is worldwide. Our product management team, our designers, our engineers are located across three different hubs in Europe. What that sort of leads to is a couple of practices that we have as part of our culture. The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers and figuring out what customer pain points and problems we can solve, but given our distributed nature in terms of having a global footprint and a lot of our go to market teams, folks in sales and marketing and customer success are in different continents or geographies, we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally. When we are interacting with folks, let's say in San Francisco, and those folks are out there meeting some of our large customers and stuff, how do we, in the product organization, understand their perspective, and bring that perspective into how we design, prioritize and build products? I think that's one thing that's unique.

(00:06:43):
I would say the other thing that's less to do with the location, but I think is sort of the core cultural value or philosophy that Andre, who's the founder and CEO has instilled in all of us, is practicing teamwork, how do we actually come together as a team, and bring down the silos that might exist across functions? I'll talk a little bit around how we are structured in the product organization so that it's a cross-functional perspective we bring to everything that we're doing because we believe the best work happens when we bring different diverse perspectives to the problem and then co-create the outcome that the customer is looking for.

Lenny (00:07:20):
I want to pull on these threads actually real quick. You talked about this value of empathy and the importance of having empathy across... because you guys are located in different locations and have different cultures, and also this idea of teamwork. What's something that you've done that helps you do that, either build empathy and maintain empathy across teams or make sure that people work in teams and not like, "Hey, there's this other team over there doing something else"?

Varun Parmar (00:07:45):
One of the most powerful things that I've seen work is the questions that you ask, the questions that you ask when you're going through product review or you are going to sit down and talk to someone and trying to understand why did they prioritize something over the other and was it something that was done through interactions they've had with folks internally or externally? I think it's the set of questions to ask in terms of how did they get to where they are today and was it informed by understanding of the insights that collectively the organization has? Was it informed by their understanding of where the market is evolving, where the competition is going.

(00:08:31):
Was it informed through the series of insights they have, either through inbound feedback that's coming through our different channels where customers are giving feedback or some outbound interactions that they've had? I think just trying to double click and getting to the details in terms of what insight led them to recommend certain things or make a left turn or a right turn is where I think is the most powerful way to make sure that those things are informed through practicing empathy internally and externally.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. There's this kind of cultural value of just assuming good intention and asking questions to understand where someone came from. I don't know if you'll have something off the top of your head, but is there a story or an example of that comes to mind where that was done well or not done well, I don't know, in something you recently were building?

Varun Parmar (00:09:16):
Maybe there are certain things, for example, anytime we're trying to build a new experience, one of the approach we want to take is very quickly validate that our original hypothesis, is that sound or not. We are big fans of the Design Sprint framework, what Jake Knapp has done I think is really amazing. In a short five-day window, you can get a small set of people to quickly mock up a concept, convert it into some sort of a prototype and then go out there and get some sort of a validation. Oftentimes when we are working on some of these new things, we have our product teams that are focused on zero to one initiatives, run this five-day initiative, and at the end of it we say, "Oh, this is great. Who did you get insight from?" There's a capability that we recently released, it's called Miro Talktrack, which essentially allows you to asynchronously do asynchronous collaboration by recording audio video on top of a Miro board.

(00:10:16):
We had two fundamental choices we could make. One, we could go down the path of what everyone's doing where you could do a screen recording and then spit out a series of videos, like pixels being captured. Or what we did was we actually went down a different path and the path that we went down was we basically synchronized the movement of the board. Let's say Lenny's presenting a board, some template he's created in terms of best practices for PMs, but he wants to have some sort of a talk track on top of it, an audio video feed. What we are doing is we're actually capturing the movement of the board that Lenny's going through along with the video talk track that's on top. The reason why we did that was because we had an insight that came through some of our interviews.

(00:10:56):
What our users want to do is they want to use Miro for collaboration. While communication is an important aspect of how teams come together, where we believe our sweet spot is that we want people to use Miro for collaboration. By making sure that they could actually use a video recording and while the video recording is playing, they could add in a sticky note, they could add in a comment, they could actually give a reaction. We were able to develop this insight by practicing empathy as part of the Design Sprint framework when we went and started to show our original concept and we walled and built on top of that.

Lenny (00:11:31):
That is a really cool story. That came out of this Sprint framework, these five-day sprint approach.

Varun Parmar (00:11:36):
Yes, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:37):
That is cool. I got to have that guy on this podcast. Jake Knapp, you said, right?

Varun Parmar (00:11:41):
Yes, yes, yes. I can text him right now and I can make the introductions, yes.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's pull him right into this podcast live, tell us how the Sprint process works. That is awesome. This connects a little bit to another question I wanted to ask around the top is, you guys are in a really competitive space and it feels like Miro was very early in online collaborative whiteboarding space and then I think during COVID it just became huge, with the remote work exploding. Like, "Holy shit, everyone needs this immediately." Over the years, many companies have come into the space that you are all in and it feels like Miro continues to do extremely well. I remember when Figma launched FigJam, there was a lot of just like, "Miro's dead. Figma's getting into the space, they're juggernaut, game over." Clearly that's not been the case and it just feels like, I don't know what it is internally that you all do that continues to allow you to compete and continue to innovate in the space. I'm curious just like is there something to how Miro approaches competition and also just, I don't know, the way they approach these sorts of challenges that is unique or interesting that you can share?

Varun Parmar (00:12:45):
If you look at the mission for Miro, we empower teams to create the next big thing and our focus is to enable teams that are innovating, and generally innovation happens at the intersection of a bunch of cross-functional folks coming together. Like we discussed, folks in product management or design or engineering or analytics or product marketing or research. What we find, Lenny, is that there are a lot of tools out there and those tools are generally sort of focused on a particular persona and maybe they're trying to solve the needs of a designer and a designer has a workflow that they're trying to do and they're using a specific tool and they sit at the adjacency of extending that core use case. The fundamental value that Miro provides is that we enable teams. I think what's unique about our product, and we can talk about the capabilities and roadmaps and use cases that we are investing in and we already have as part of the product, is that we take a team-centric lens.

(00:13:50):
So we're not saying, "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for designers," or "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for engineers." Because we fundamentally believe that innovation happens when cross-functional teams come together. When you look at the problem through that lens, you realize that you have to actually architect your solution. You have to think about the use cases and you have to go and prioritize certain experiences that are different and our customers see value in that, right? I think that's probably one sort of big macro aspect of how we think about our capabilities and products and why our customers think of us differently. I'd say that's say one point.

(00:14:27):
I think the second thing is Miro is actually used obviously by teams that are creating these innovative products and we actually have broad applicability across industries and verticals. While some tools might be hyper-focused on digital experiences and Miro's has great offerings there in terms of core capabilities, what we find is that Miro is used equally by companies in manufacturing, by companies in healthcare, by companies in architecture and engineering and construction functions, by companies that are in aerospace, governmental agencies and medical agencies and so on and so forth. I think the platform is actually much more agnostic in terms of its capabilities and what we offer that actually makes it more accessible and appealing to organizations that want to go beyond just digital experiences.

(00:15:26):
Then I would say finally there are capabilities that are available very, very uniquely to Miro that are valued by our users. That again is a big reason people come to Miro. For example, if Lenny's trying to conduct a big workshop with a bunch of product folks and he wants to facilitate that workshop and wants to have certain folks focus on one part of the board and while others focus on the other part, then there are some advanced capabilities that enable certain use cases like workshops. Or if you want to use Miro for some team rituals or from some agile practices, there are core set of capabilities that you could use the product for that are missing in some of the other capabilities. I would say a combination of all of those three things continue to drive differentiation. I would say on top of that, we are a big fan of our community and we believe that community love is what drives us. That's the fuel that keeps us going every single day.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Just to summarize and I was taking notes as you're chatting, just thinking about what allows you all to continue to do well in the market, considering all the competition constantly coming at you. One, as you mentioned, just there's kind of like a innate multi-functional architecture which is hard for someone to copy if they weren't built from that without the start. Two, it sounds like you are focusing on a wide spectrum of personas and it's not just tech employees basically. Also, just there's specific features that end up being really important that maybe people have a hard time building and then this last piece of the community. Awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:17:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:17:09):
Let's dig into the product team a little bit and understand how you all build product and structure product team. How many PMs are there at Miro? Then just broadly, how many employees, just to give people a set of, little bit of context?

Varun Parmar (00:17:20):
Give or take about 1,800 employees at Miro globally across all of the 12 hubs, and specifically in terms of the number of product managers, there are over 450 PMs in the team.

Lenny (00:17:34):
Then how's the product team structured? Is it like outcome oriented? Is it product area oriented? Is it user persona oriented? Is it something else? How do you think about the structure of the product team?

Varun Parmar (00:17:46):
Yeah, so I would say it's maybe a hybrid structure that we have, but the foundation of the team setup is around persona. We have what we refer to as streams, some companies refer to as domains, but essentially it's a set of individuals that are focused on solving the problems for a key persona. Just to give you an example, we have a stream that's focused on enterprise, and in enterprise we are looking at the IT admin persona, we're looking at the security persona or the compliance persona. There are a set of folks who are creating a roadmap and innovating for that audience. There's another stream which is called platform where we are going after the developer install base, folks that want to use Miro as a platform and build apps that they can actually make available either on the marketplace for everyone to use or they could be developers that are inside of a large organization and they're trying to integrate Miro with their specific use cases and workflows and business systems. That's another sort of stream that's focused on that, and there are a couple of other streams like that.

(00:18:53):
Then finally there are some just horizontal sort of streams, if you will. We have a big focus given that we are a PLG-led company around growth and self-serve business. We've got a stream that's actually focused on our core internal infrastructure. We've got a stream that's actually focused on data science that's doing all of the magic that we started to release in terms of Miro AI, et cetera, et cetera. I would say it's a combination of those. At the heart of it is we are focused on personas and we are sort of aligning people around solving problems and creating value for that persona.

Lenny (00:19:24):
That is really interesting. One of the downsides of a persona-based approach I imagine is that features keep getting added that solve that user's pain points. What have you learned about keeping the product consistent and having a holistic perspective on the experience? How do you address Those challenges?

Varun Parmar (00:19:43):
Architecturally, there are two sort of things that we have done that allow us to not pigeonhole ourselves into that specific way of working. I completely agree with you, you could lead to that. The first one is actually when we think about the product org, we call our org, it's called AMPED, A-M-P-E-D. This is actually going back to our earlier point, Lenny, we had around what's unique about the product culture, what's unique about Miro, and we talked about teams coming together, removing barriers or silos cross-functionally. AMPED stands for analytics, marketing, product, engineering and design. And everything that we do in the product org, when we say the product org, we actually don't meet product managers. We actually don't mean product managers, designers and engineers. What we mean by product org in Miro is this AMPED function. By having this cross-functional representation where product marketing team is deeply, deeply embedded inside of each of these streams, what we do is that we have different perspectives that come in where they say, "Oh, wait a second, did you think about the end user experience?"

(00:20:49):
If you think about the end user experience, you know have someone on the team that says, "Wait a second, did you actually think about the enterprise requirements or what's needed in the largest corporation?" I think the unique setup of bringing these cross-functional folks allows us to sort of course correct. The second thing is the ways of working that we have. We have these product reviews that happen. We generally classify anything that we are doing in terms of its complexity around a small, medium or high complexity, and anything that's being worked on is actually being shared with the entire organization. If it's something that's small to medium, it's actually shared with the entire product org. In fact, if you are non-product, you can actually subscribe to that Slack channel as well. Everybody sees what the product org is working on, everybody sees what the core hypothesis is, "What is the solution for that, what is the proposed design for it, how are we thinking about the capabilities?"

(00:21:49):
Then anything that's big actually goes through a formal process like a product review where there's a meeting and a bunch of us are in there and it's up to us, including the product leaders, to basically make sure that we are connecting the dots in terms of having a much more holistic perspective. I would say lastly, as Miro has sort of scaled the spectrum of companies all the way from a team that might have two or three people and might be taking out their credit card and using Miro for their own team all the way to a large corporation that might have 50,000, 80,000 employees, all of them are using Miro. We've come to realize that at some point the deep enterprise requirements need to be encapsulated in a set of requirements or best practices and we need to make sure that those get democratized across all of the feature teams.

(00:22:36):
When I'm thinking about building a new feature, I have a checklist in front of me where I can say, "Here are the 10 things that I need to think of that I need to incorporate early on in my thinking in the architecture, in the definition of the process, so that it doesn't come downstream." I would say that's an area where we're still working on and more recently we put more focus and energy and there's a product manager who's now leading that particular charter.

Lenny (00:22:57):
I love all these details. This AMPED structure, I love that. There's analytics, you said product marketing, analyst marketing and then product engineering design. It's rare that you see marketing as a part of teams, as a leadership, kind of part of the leadership group. Do you have a sense of what impact adding that had on the team or where that came from? Or is that just historically been something Miro has prioritized, marketing and product marketing?

Varun Parmar (00:23:25):
This was done before I got here and I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't. I think this was the result of an observation, which is quite similar to what you're saying, which is while we might be developing a lot of the features and PMs or thinking bottoms-up in terms of what we are building, we might find that what we have built might not be able to capture the imagination of what we originally thought it would. A big part of that is how are you going to think about positioning, how are you going to think about competitive differentiation? How are you going to package it up so that the sellers that are out there are able to position it in a way that the customer, in this case the buyer, might be an IT professional, might a line business leader, can basically see the full vision of where we are going? I think by having product marketing as part of AMPED, we now bring that unique perspective that may be missing in certain teams.

(00:24:24):
PMs are more acting as product owners or more focused on core problem and solution but not thinking about positioning, because that's so important, especially when you're thinking about a market that we are increasingly in that there is competition there. That's one of the first things we started off with and that's top of mind for you as well, is that everything that we are doing has to be looked through that lens. One of the core philosophies that I have, Lenny, is that the success of a company is a direct relation of what the competition allows you to do. I feel like not many people talk about that, but in many cases in my professional career, and I've been at it for close to 24, 25 years, is that every single instance when I looked at a company accelerated their growth or there was a deceleration of growth, it was a direct relation to what the competition allowed you to do. Obviously, you have to do everything that you should be doing, but competition is the biggest variable that allows you to figure that out.

Lenny (00:25:24):
I want to hear more about your core product philosophies, but let me dig into the one you just shared. What you find is that the way you grow or stop growing is often a direct result of your competition. Is there an example of that that comes to mind? I'm guessing maybe Box versus Dropbox is an experience you had there, or if not, what's an example of that that you've experienced, to make it a little more concrete even?

Varun Parmar (00:25:50):
For those of us who've been in the collaboration space, and I've been doing collaboration and productivity apps for over 20 years, over two decades, at some point, you have companies like Microsoft that get really attracted to a space and you can see the trajectory of a business that's growing at a certain clip and then all of a sudden there's a competitive product that enters that has the might of distribution and the might of pricing, and that's just a direct example. I think I've seen that multiple times, first at Adobe where I was part of the document cloud business, clearly saw that at Box as well.

(00:26:27):
I think you can, in general, sort of look at every single category and you can say that there was a category leader and they were growing at a certain clip or a certain pace and all of a sudden there were a bunch of entrants that get in and what happens to your growth rate? It's all dependent on how strong is the competitor in terms of providing a good enough solution? That's one. The second is how strong is the competition in terms of their distribution outreach? Then the third thing is how strong is the competition in terms of the pricing and packaging?

Lenny (00:26:55):
I really like this discussion, especially because often the advice is, "Don't worry about the competition, just focus on the customer, it's going to be fine." Which what you're saying is that's not right, and I agree. What do you do with that in mind? How does that impact the way you build product or strategy? Is there some you could share that maybe tactically someone could leverage to how they're approaching their product strategy?

Varun Parmar (00:27:18):
It depends on who the competition is and what is their unfair advantage here. We talked about one specific competitor and I have a lot of respect for them, by the way, and I learn a lot from them every single day in terms of how they make bets and how they enter markets and stuff. At some point I'm going to write a book on them, I feel.

Lenny (00:27:35):
Ooh. We'll have to come back to talk about that.

Varun Parmar (00:27:38):
That's right, yeah. I think it sort of comes down to how do you think about your unique place relative to all of these players, and in your customer's mind are they able to clearly understand what is the unique value that you deliver relative to everything else? Part of that is the unique capabilities you provide. Part of that is how you're packaging those unique capabilities to them, and making sure that they in their mind can see how you coexist in this overall sort of tech ecosystem that they might be investing in, to enable their employees or to enable them to operate. So I think it's sort of looking at that from that lens, yeah.

Lenny (00:28:26):
Got it. So what I'm hearing is be very clear about your differentiator and continue to invest there and then make sure your positioning is clear around why you're... just identifying, "Here's why we're different and we're not just a better or worse version of this thing" or "Here's why we're different" and making sure that's really clear.

Varun Parmar (00:28:43):
Exactly. I think the other thing I would say, there's another core philosophy I have, which is products either get better over a period of time or they get worse. Products never remain the same. I think you can take that philosophy to a bunch of things in life, but I'm going to take the lens of products, which is my core philosophy is every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. The lens for this, Lenny, is actually from a customer's perspective, from the end user perspective. The thing is that if you are a player where there's no one else in the market, that's one thing, so that's great. Kudos to you for actually identifying a blue ocean strategy and sort of executing to that. But most markets, most products, actually have either direct or indirect competitors that are available.

(00:29:40):
From the customer's mind, you're doing something, the competitor is doing something, so in their mind they're looking at these products and they're looking at these companies and they're saying, "Which is better versus not?" So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you're either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, if you have in mind, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be. Because every single move that you're making, the customer has that sort of in their mind, if not explicitly, implicitly that they're actually comparing these things. I think it brings a level of focus in terms of where you need to invest and why you need to invest and why this is going to make those decisions.

(00:30:28):
I think it allows at least for product leaders to make some high quality decisions around the bets that they're making and how they're going to play out in terms of eventual once the dust settles and the market at large is going to say, "I'm going to standardize on something and now I feel I need to go get it for everyone." Or "This is the tool that I want to use for this particular use case." That all of these decisions that you are making ladder up to that final sort of play that you have to do in terms of the market consolidation that eventually happens.

Lenny (00:30:59):
This is so interesting. Essentially what you're saying is that you find that being very close to and understanding the competition really well is really essential, versus this kind of the other end of the spectrum almost from just like, "Don't worry about the competition, don't pay attention." I like this point, metaphor of just like, "Are we moving ahead or further behind?" Is that where you operationalize that to track that? Then also just how do you not over-obsess with, "Let's just catch up, get more features," that kind of thing? How do you find that balance?

Varun Parmar (00:31:28):
I'll be honest, I don't think we've figured it out. We haven't cracked the nut in terms of how to operationalize this, but I know you are way smarter than me on some of these things, so maybe we can-

Lenny (00:31:39):
Unlikely.

Varun Parmar (00:31:39):
... partner on this and come up with something.

Lenny (00:31:43):
All right, that'll be something we work on. Any other product philosophies that you want to share? That was awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:31:52):
This is all sort of related to it. It's like a string of pearls. I think there's maybe one more pearl we can actually thread into the needle right here.

Lenny (00:31:59):
Let's do it.

Varun Parmar (00:32:00):
Which is we talked about how do you ladder this up and stuff, and then the question is, okay, how do you know that everything that you're doing, is that in the right direction or not? Should you move slow and be much more mindful about the things that you're doing or should you move fast and make certain bets and then decide certain things and stuff? I think there are two views that are out there. My personal perspective on this is that what you want to do is that you want to be the first one to hit the brick wall. This is particularly true when you are in a market that is competitive. The reason for that is that if you consider yourself as an innovation-centric company and you believe that you are building experiences that fundamentally don't exist anywhere else and you're sort of paving the way for the rest of the folks to basically get inspired with how you are building these experiences, speed is the single biggest determinant, in my experience, in terms of who ends up being more successful versus not.

(00:33:14):
I don't know, maybe this is a little bit controversial where people say, Go slow to actually go fast." I think I have a lot of respect for that and there's certain areas you should do that, but when you are trying to figure out new experiences and stuff and you don't know if it's going to resonate or not, speed is something that you should accelerate for the organization. I think Frank Slootman talks about this a lot in his book and how can you accelerate? I think for me from a product perspective, the fundamental concept is can you be the first one to hit the brick wall where you have the learning faster than anyone else in the market so that you can decide, "Oh my god, the path that I was going was not the right path. I need to do 10 degrees west or I need to do 30 degrees east." I think as long as you're one or two or three steps ahead of everyone else in terms of uncovering or discovering those insights, then I think you can continue to be ahead of the pack in terms of building your product in business.

Lenny (00:34:21):
You're talking about urgency. I've never met a founder or a product leader who doesn't want their team to move faster. They're always encouraging their team, "How do we move faster?" I'm curious if there's something you've learned tactically about helping your team move more quickly. You mentioned Frank Slootman's book. Amp It Up is what it's called, by the way, in case folks want to check it out and he's big on just like creating a sense of urgency, constant urgency, and we'll link to that and share notes. But yeah, what have you found helps create urgency and generally helps your teams move faster other than just like, "Move faster, everyone"?

Varun Parmar (00:34:52):
My fundamental belief here, Lenny, is that every product manager... I can talk to product managers because there is reason certain ones, someone wants to be a product manager, because in my view it's one of the most thankless jobs, like you get to do a lot of [inaudible 00:35:10] and it's like, "Why you have to do this?" But it attracts a certain personality and that personality is driven by challenge and that personality wants to prove that they can solve this challenge and do something amazing. I think fundamentally the product persona actually wants to move fast. I think the reason why in some cases we are not able to move fast is because of roadblocks that we run into and those roadblocks can manifest themselves into technical challenges, they can manifest them in cells of organizational challenges, they could be priority challenges and so on and so forth.

(00:35:52):
My fundamental approach to solving that is to ensure that the product leads who are working on these capabilities can instantly raise their hand and call out that there are challenges that they are running into. Then the job of the leadership team, the product management team, is to essentially go and quickly resolve those issues. I think if you are able to resolve those issues, then what it does is it actually starts a virtuous cycle where you can actually start to see those wins. Once you see those wins, you actually create that courage to do more things. Maybe because you've seen how that specific roadblock was solved and you have a pattern matching that you've developed now, you can solve a lot of those things on your own and it's the next level of challenge that you now going to raise your hand.

(00:36:41):
What that does is it starts to build this organizational competency in terms of how you can figure out what to build. We all find these people in our organizations where there's someone somehow is able to do certain things in one-tenth the time that it would take a normal person. It's not that they are 10 times faster, it's just that in my observation that they've figured out which part of the core base they should build in versus not, who should be part of their team and who should not be, how they need to define that from a scope perspective, what does success look like, and it's the architecture of bringing all of these things together that actually brings that magic formula line in terms of "Hey, we are able to deliver faster."

Lenny (00:37:19):
I really like this topic. What I'm hearing is one of the biggest roots of slowdown in a company and product development is blockers not being unblocked, and I always feel the same thing. I feel like a PM's number one job is to unblock their team because their job is basically make the most out of their team that they're marshaling towards some outcome. The way you do that is just figure out what's slowing them down. You just talked about this idea of a PM raises their hand to leadership, "Hey, we're blocked by this thing." Is there a process you've come up with there that helps you do that, it's connected to-

Varun Parmar (00:37:51):
Yeah, I would say we are trying to sort of systematically ingrain this in the culture of the organization. We have a motto in the product org, it's very simple, single sentence, deliver customer value faster with high quality. That's it. Everything that we do, and when I say everything, everything, Lenny, from performance and reward system and measurements, everything is based on this one single statement and it has three attributes. The first one is deliver customer value, and we believe customer value is only delivered when customers use it. Anytime as a PM at Miro, when you ship something, we are looking at, "Well, what was the metric you were going to move and how much did it move?" We have some original targets that we can go back to. That's the first aspect of what we're doing, deliver customer value.

(00:38:35):
The second one is move faster, and there are certain cycle times that we are measuring across the organization. From the time you came up with the idea to the time that you actually pitched a solution to the time you actually shipped it, to the time we actually moved the metric, it's information that has been collected and is being made available to the organization. You can say, "Hey, if it was a small, medium or large, what's the average? What's the medium, what's the variance?" And you can say, "Hey, looking at this data, what can be improved?" That's on the faster aspect of it. Then the last one is around high quality, which is we want to build best in class collaboration experiences, so we are always getting inspired by what we find in applications and experiences that we see around us and we are saying, "Hey, when it comes to designing, sharing flows, we believe that these are the three apps that have best in class sharing flows when it comes to designing some synchronous capabilities like this. These are the best in class apps that we should look at."

(00:39:31):
We are always trying to make sure that we are benchmarking ourselves against that and we have our design team. On a regular basis, like when we ship stuff on a monthly basis, our design leadership team does a triage of everything that got shipped into high quality or not high quality. It's just like a binary function, and we're doing that and we're saying, "Hey, the reason why we believe it's not high quality is because A, B, C, D, E and we're making it available to other designers so they can actually start to build that telemetry in terms of some things are more subjective." But you can start to see some patent matching and say like, "Hey, this is what great looks like."

Lenny (00:40:06):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress, and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large established companies such as Vercel, Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using linear as magical.

(00:41:15):
Okay, so every month or so the design team looks at everything that's shipped and puts things into a bucket. Either this is... It's like a binary thing, high quality or not high quality.

Varun Parmar (00:41:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:41:24):
Wow, that is so cool. Then, one, what do they do with that? Do they send it out to the product team? Then two, is this just like FYI or is it like, "We need to fix all these low quality things going back"? Or is it more just like, "For the future, please be aware these are not high quality"?

Varun Parmar (00:41:39):
Yeah, so it's actually both. Generally what happens is that the design leadership team is doing this and there's one particular design leader who's the designated person to make sure that this is happening on a regular basis. Right now the way we're using it is that we are actually using it to calibrate and align around the design leadership around what we mean by high quality. Because it's one of those things, it's like if you've never seen colors and I ask you, "Lenny, describe pink and compare that to red," and if you haven't seen colors, how do you describe colors? You can't. But if I show you and I say, "Lenny, these are three examples of what pink is and these are three examples of red is," then you're like, "Oh, I get pink and I get red." There are certain things that you just like when you write it's very, very hard to describe it, but if you show specific examples, it's very clear, "Oh, I get it. I get how pink is different than red." But if I try to describe it, it's going to be very hard.

(00:42:35):
So we got into these endless conversations at some point about a year ago where we were saying, "We need high quality, we need high quality." And people are like, "Let's just go and define this thing." We had a bunch of our leaders go and write documents, really long documents in terms of what are the attributes and how do we define those attributes and how do we measure those attributes and how do we enable people to do that? It felt like it's a good thing because we are trying to codify it, but it also felt like it was a very heavy way of solving that problem. Then we just came up with this approach, which is like, "What's great versus not great" and just start classifying it. As you know, it's like modern AI systems are classification systems and we [inaudible 00:43:12]-

Lenny (00:43:12):
Yeah, I was going to say, sounds like reinforcement learning approach here.

Varun Parmar (00:43:14):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:43:14):
Defining cost.

Varun Parmar (00:43:15):
That's right. That's right. I think it's worked decently well. I would say with most things we need to operationalize it and we need to make sure that now we are democratizing it and everybody has access to it and so on and so forth. But I think it's been a good start and now we are sharing this more openly with others in the org.

Lenny (00:43:37):
When I said that, I imagined you... From the outside, you have a very unique culture and approach your product. That's a great example of that. I've never heard of a process like this. What I'm hearing is essentially you're trying to build the muscle within the organization of what is quality. It's like this continued heuristic of, "Okay, I get it." So PMs on the team start to understand in their head what that means.

Varun Parmar (00:43:56):
Right.

Lenny (00:43:57):
Super cool. You also talked about, in the middle part of that sentence, of moving faster and that you track and measure that somehow. Can you talk more about that? Because that's something every product team is always trying to understand. "How do we know if we're going faster, if we're going as fast as we could?" How do you actually do that? How do you measure these things?

Varun Parmar (00:44:13):
The core philosophy there is velocity is more like the game of golf where you're just playing against yourself. It's not like if Lenny and Varun are out at the golf course, it doesn't matter. I'm not competing against you, I'm just competing against myself because that's the only... I'm going to just hit the ball, so it's like how much better can we get? I think our core philosophies around that and what we're trying to do is that on all the product teams, the feature teams that we have, we're just collecting all the information and we are making it available to everyone so that they can actually see what the cycle times are. What we are interested in is from the time that you have an insight, from the time you believe "I can do something unique for my user, for my persona," how long does it take for you to actually deliver that value?

(00:45:04):
We have a product process that we follow, which starts with a P-strat, which is a strategy, and then we go into P0, which is definition of the problem, then we go into P1, which is definition of the solution, and then we go into P2, which is once the solution is shipped, are we hitting the metrics that we originally had defined upfront before we decided to work on this. You have all of these stage gates and then we basically classify everything that we are doing in small, medium, large. You can go in and you can say, "Hey, I thought this was a small thing," and small thing is something you can get it done in less than a month, and so on and so forth. There are 50 other product teams that are shipping these features, and what's the average, what's the variance, what's the median?

(00:45:48):
"Oh, wait a second, actually it seems like I took way more time in the problem definition stage. Let me actually try to go talk to this other product team that actually did it much faster," or "Oh, I actually did it really, really fast, and the reason why I did it fast was because of this. Let me go share this out with the broader team." Usually the product ops function, we call it product excellence internal, sort of product excellence function, is recording some of these things. I would say getting reliable data, and then because we have some things that are going through meetings and there are some things that are going through Slack, we could do better on some of those dimensions, but all of this data is available and we provided it openly and folks can benchmark themselves against that.

Lenny (00:46:34):
So cool. Okay, so you have this P-strat, you called it, document which is kind an initial concept and then it's interesting you use the P0, P1, which is often for bugs, but it's cool that you use it for defining your products. So P-strat is just an idea pitch. P0 is a spec, basically, like a one-pager for the product, and then P1 and P2 are basically getting to "Here's the actual product we're building." And you basically track time per step and map it to, "Here's how large this project should be." Over time you track per person, it sounds like, just like are you matching the benchmarks of how long a small project should take across each step?

Varun Parmar (00:47:13):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:47:14):
Wow, that is extremely cool. Whatever templates you can share, these things that we can include in the show notes would be awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:47:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:22):
Because people are always looking for just like, "Ah, I want do some of this stuff." If they can just plug and play, the more, the merrier.

Varun Parmar (00:47:28):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:29):
Shifting a little bit, it sounds like you guys are doing Scrum in some form. Can you just talk about just broadly the product development process? How long you or your sprints, how long do you plan for in the future, in detail specifically just like high level, how does the product development process work?

Varun Parmar (00:47:43):
There are certain things that I learned at Box and that inspired some things that we do at Miro, and there are certain things that we've evolved. One of the things that we've instituted is our roadmap process, so that's sort of the first thing around how the different teams are looking at the things that they're going to work on. We have a rolling six month roadmap, it seems large, but we've got, like I mentioned, a number of enterprise customers. If I've learned one thing that large enterprises is asking for a roadmap review. That tends to be my favorite meeting of sitting down with the enterprise leaders and walking through what we are working on. What we've done is we've tried to architect something which actually allows our customers to get what they're looking for, but at the same time does not remove the agility that is so important for us to deliver value faster.

(00:48:41):
What we do is we have a rolling six month roadmap that gets updated every three months and the first three months of that roadmap, we have a 80% position level, which means that 80% of the things that we claim to be on the roadmap will get done. That's the target. For the next three months, because it's six months, so the first three months is 80%, the next three months is 50%, so we have a much lower level of resolution in the next three months after that. What that allows the product teams to do is actually have flexibility, which is based on what the customers are asking for and based on what the competitive moves are, based on some technology breakthroughs that happen around large language models, they can pivot and they can pivot and move towards that and they won't get penalized either by the customer or internally in terms of doing that. That's what we do and that's all at on the backdrop of an annual strategy that we publish.

(00:49:34):
Every year we publish a strategy white paper that it gets published internally available to every single Mironeer across all functions that clearly articulates the key bets that we want to make. Why do we want to make those bets? What is the expected outcome and how does that ladder up into the overall business outcomes that we are trying to drive from an OKR perspective as well as the overall business strategy that we have. So people take that product strategy, white paper or artifact, and then against that they're building their roadmaps which get updated every three months. Then inside of the teams, we enable teams to be quite autonomous in terms of some of the rituals that they're doing. We want them to obviously embrace best practices. We've got a team of agile coaches that share best practices or are available to help if there's certain specific needs that teams have.

(00:50:31):
Then I think on top of that, there are certain key, I would say, rituals that we do that maybe are unique. For example, we have something called as Miro Connect, which happens every other Friday. Every other Friday, for example, in our Amsterdam office, you can go in there and at 4:00 in the afternoon, 4:00 to 7:00 or 8:00, and sometimes it goes really late, you've got a bunch of product teams sitting around tables and it feels like, "Oh, it's like a pitch or something." And people are coming in, they're having a good time, you've got a drink in your hand, there's maybe some light music playing in the background and you're going from table to table and you have teams that are actually showing all the amazing work that... If done right, it happens once in a while, but if done right, it's magical in terms of the outcomes that you can get.

(00:51:20):
I'll tell you, there was a team that actually was presenting at our Berlin hub and they were saying, "We're working on this feature, and there's an engineer who walks over to that desk and says, 'What are you working on?'" The team describes it, "Oh, we are trying to do something like this." And this engineer had actually worked on that particular problem in their prior life, literally they had implemented this. So he says, "So how are you going to implement this?" And the team, the engineer that's sitting there, says, "This is the approach I'm going to take and it's going to take me three months." He's like, "Oh, would you mind if I go and help you with this?" They're like, "Sure, more the merrier. Go ahead." So this person puts down their beer and says, "Okay, I'm having a good time. Let me just head back to my home." And in the next three or four hours goes and codes the entire thing, makes a poll request.

(00:52:10):
Next day in the morning one of the engineers from this core team that was exhibiting at Miro Connect looks at the poll request, reviews the code and says, "Yes, something that would have taken three months for this core team because they didn't have the expertise literally got done in three hours because there was another engineer that ran into them and said, "I know how this is done. I can actually help you here," and went ahead and did the right thing. We are trying to create these magic moments. It happens once in a while, but we have one success story and I like to tell that in every opportunity that I get. But that's another sort of unique thing that we've done in terms of book-ending things around how we operate here.

Lenny (00:52:50):
That story is like a dream for any PM. Just imagine saving months of work with one conversation. I imagine people were like, "How do we replicate this often?" I love that. With these meetings, just to understand, if their team is in Berlin, let's say, there's a screen there in front of a table and they're talking through a screen, like a video conference?

Varun Parmar (00:53:12):
Yeah. I mean, right now what we've figured out is that it is really hard to do these events over audio-video conferencing and stuff. So generally what happens is that you have an audio-video bridge that's playing, but mostly it's people walking up to the respective teams and then having a live conversation. That's usually how these things are operated. Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Got it. Okay, so you have six month rolling roadmaps. You have a yearly vision strategy for the company, two week sprints. Is there also a quarterly OKR sort of process or is it-

Varun Parmar (00:53:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:48):
... those or not? There is, okay.

Varun Parmar (00:53:48):
There is, yeah.

Lenny (00:53:49):
Can you just talk a little bit about how that works?

Varun Parmar (00:53:51):
Yes, yes, yes. At Miro, we practice OKRs and it starts off at the company level, and then those company level OKRs are taken by the AMPED organization. Like we describe, it's the AMPED organization, and then we break it up and I would say we have refined it over the period of time, the two years that I've been at Miro. Early on we were doing OKRs on a quarterly basis, and I would say more recently we've actually evolved to six month KRs. What we found was that six month was the right cadence in terms of giving enough time for teams to basically push forward in executing these KRS and minimizing the "overhead" of doing replan every single quarter. We found that it was much more effective and efficient for the entire organization to do it on a six-month basis. However, we are doing traction on a monthly basis. So every four weeks, as AMPED, we are looking at our KRS for the AMPED organization on a monthly basis doing traction. However, the planning, the targets, are done on a six-month basis.

Lenny (00:55:06):
I love how OKRs could just be anything, could be every six months, could have objectives, could have key results. It's just such a term that just applies to anything that people do with goals, basically.

Varun Parmar (00:55:17):
That's true.

Lenny (00:55:18):
And it works. It's great.

Varun Parmar (00:55:19):
That is so true.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Again, if there's any templates that your team could share of the way you do that stuff, that would be amazing, and we'll include that in the show notes.

Varun Parmar (00:55:27):
Yeah, absolutely. Because I think, as you would expect, we run Miro on Miro, so there's a lot of things that we could share as templates in terms of how we are running things on Miro, not just as OKRs, but in terms of product reviews. We have ways of how we are doing asynchronous reviews combined with synchronous reviews and there's this blended experiences that we have, and so we can definitely share out with the community how we do some of these things.

Lenny (00:55:55):
Awesome. That's a great segue to another question I was going to ask is just what other tools, what's in the stack of the product team's workflow? So Miro, obviously. Maybe talk about what use Miro for, but then what else is in there? What do you use for task management, bug tracking, things like that? Design?

Varun Parmar (00:56:12):
Starting from the bottom-up infrastructure view, so all of our tickets are handled in Jira and we are using some of the newer capabilities in Jira in terms of coming up with roadmaps and coming up with the priorities and stuff. On top of that, all of the specs generally get recorded in Confluence. Having said that, we're actually a big fan of tools like Google Docs as well as Coda that allows us to track our KRs in a pretty effective way. On top of that, obviously we use Miro a lot, I would say for a lot of our things, especially on the product and design side of the team. Generally all of our insights get captured inside of Miro board, so when we are going and conducting user experience interviews and stuff, we will record those and then those recordings get added to a Miro board, so Miro access the content hub or a team hub for a particular project.

(00:57:20):
Once you capture all of those insights, then generally all of the brainstorming and team ideation happens on the Miro board as well, so Miro's actually also used as a tool to facilitate meetings and workshops. Once all of that is synthesized into a set of recommendations and outcomes, so when we go into these product reviews that we were talking about, Lenny, the same Miro board then gets manifested into a set of presentations, so we use Miro for presentations. We've actually made some really amazing updates in terms of our capabilities there and if folks haven't checked them out, I would strongly encourage them. There's a capability called Showtime that basically abstracts out the UI and lets people focus on the content, but do it in a way that it's interactive so everyone that's on the call can have reactions, can share their comments and leave comments while the presentation is happening without actually disrupting any of the flow for the user, so we use that a lot for presentations as well.

(00:58:15):
I would say more recently what we've started to do is that we've started to move some of our synchronous meetings into asynchro view. I talked about this Talktrack feature that we have, and a lot of teams, what they would do is that they would actually send you five minute, 10 minute Talktrack in advance and it's just a link to a Miro board, you click on it and then you just sit back and relax. Then you have this magical experience where you're sitting back and the Miro board is automatically moving because Lenny was recording it like that. Then you have the video play and then you can pause it anytime, you can add in your comments and stuff so that the next time when you meet, instead of actually providing context to everyone, those synchronous sessions are lot more deliberate and focused on driving outcomes or achieving consensus, so people are just focusing on the comments that were added as part of a async product review so that when they meet synchronously they can use that. Miro boards are used for that as well.

(00:59:06):
I would say now a lot of our dashboarding shows up in Miro boards now. We recently released data visualization capabilities around most popular VI tools. At Miro we use Google Looker a lot, so a lot of our dashboards are in Looker, and what you would typically find is that our analyst team and product teams will just grab a link to a Looker dashboard, put it on a Miro board, and it unfolds into a full visualization. Unlike a screen grab, you never have to go update it because right there on the Miro board, it's always updated and you can refresh that, so you basically have this experience where Miro acts as that single source of truth for a lot of the teams across the entire journey of product development where a single Miro board is meeting the needs of multiple use cases there.

Lenny (00:59:51):
Then for the road-mapping, is that in Miro, each team's roadmap, or do you use something like Jira?

Varun Parmar (00:59:57):
Yeah, so I think we've got a couple of tools for road-mapping, and our observation is that while those tools are great for the unique needs that they're solving, we haven't found a universal solution for road-mapping. So there are some teams that use Miro for road-mapping and they would use the Kanban widget in Miro for that. What are they working on? What's coming next? What's in the backlog? But I would say it is a problem that is not completely solved in terms of how do we actually bring these artifacts together at scale.

(01:00:27):
What we are starting to see, and this is actually a unique use case of Miro, is that we actually enable our entire field organization using Talktracks. What happens is that we have our entire roadmap published out as a Miro board for enablement purposes, so that that's a artifact that is approved to be shown to a customer. What you will see is that you'll see five or six recordings in there, and the leader for enterprise has done a five-minute recording on everything they're working on. The leader for platform has done that. The leader for end user experience has done that. The person who's driving some of our AI experience has done that. So you can go in and you can just click on that video and you can meet your needs by using Miro and this capability that we have.

Lenny (01:01:09):
That's awesome. It sounds like each team can basically choose the tools they want to use. There's no standardized, everyone needs to use Jira or Miro for their roadmap. I like that. I like how teams do that often. Maybe one last question around the product org, and then I want to shift a little bit to growth and how Miro grows and things you have learned about growing. Question I always try to get to is how do you think about balancing new bets and innovation with maintenance and just general incremental work? Do you have some sort of philosophy as a product leader broadly, and then maybe at Miro specifically, of just how to balance investments in these two buckets and maybe three buckets, bugs, incremental work, and then just big bet? How do you think about that?

Varun Parmar (01:01:55):
We have some rule of thumbs in terms of how we want to allocate our investments across these buckets. I would say a lot of it, Lenny, actually depends on the state of the team. There are certain teams that have more tech debt than others. There are certain teams that are actually working on some really big zero to one features than other teams, and so I think there is a variance. The standard deviation actually is dependent on which part of the spectrum that you're in, which is are you a team that we believe needs to create the next generation experience on the platform and hence we have to prioritize innovative work or are you the team that's actually so critical to actually meeting our objective around better board performance or any of the other things that we believe are important and hence we need to invest in those critical areas?

(01:02:41):
But I would say in general innovation versus not, varies on a spectrum of anywhere from 60 to 80%. I would say about 20 to 40% of the available capacity at any given time is either getting allocated to architectural initiatives. There's a technology roadmap that our CTO is driving that we believe is extremely important as the platform scales, and now as we have over 50 million people on the platform, so we continuously have to invest in making sure that the platform can scale. There are certain teams that probably have 40 to 50% of their allocation towards that because they're a critical part of the component. There are other teams that are maybe more end user focused and are more UI focused where that allocation is lower. But I think general rule of thumb is 20% is always a given, but it can go as high as 40 to 50%.

Lenny (01:03:30):
On bigger bets and longer-term thinking?

Varun Parmar (01:03:33):
Yeah, 20 to 40% goes on the technology-related initiatives and maintenance and stuff.

Lenny (01:03:38):
Oh, got it. Infrastructure, maintenance, making sure everything's there. Got it.

Varun Parmar (01:03:44):
[inaudible 01:03:44] Exactly, yeah.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Then what about just big, long-term bets that you're not expecting to pay off anytime soon? Do you have a heuristic of just what percentage of, say, total resources you put there?

Varun Parmar (01:03:53):
You've probably seen this, the framework of three horizon, it's quite popular in McKinsey and Harvard [inaudible 01:04:01] school and so on and so forth, is horizon one business, which is the thing that's delivering food on the table. Generally there's about a 70% allocation of resources that we have, give or take. Then there is horizon two, which is an adjacent thing. With the next 12 to 36 months we believe it's material. Usually that tends to be around 20% of the allocation. Then there's horizon three, which is three years out, three to five years, next generation things, and that's about 10% of the ratio. So it's like 70/20/10 across horizon one, two, and three.

Lenny (01:04:30):
Awesome. Any other thoughts along the lines of just how you think about product before we shift? I only have a few questions around the growth story of Miro and what you've learned about growing.

Varun Parmar (01:04:41):
In terms of product leadership and what we believe is the way we want product leaders to be developed and I think it's more of a people philosophy. We have our product leadership which constitutes of all of the folks who are running all of these streams, and I always tell them that you have two personas that you have to think about. Everyone who's on the product leadership team is a product leadership team member. The fundamental thing that you have to do is drive accountability. The number one thing that a product leader on the product leadership team needs to do is drive accountability with others in the product leadership team. The other persona that they have is that they are a stream leader. They're actually responsible for delivering value for the respective persona and respective customers and stuff. So when you put on the persona hat of a stream leader, which is different than the persona or of a product leader, your number one metric, the number one goal that you have, is drive improvement.

(01:05:42):
When you go back and you work with your team, always have the lens are you improving things and whatever you want to improve, but you always have to ask yourself, "Today compared to yesterday, tomorrow compared to today, have I improved things? That's the yardstick you should think about. When you go sit in the product leadership team every Monday afternoon at 1:00 in the afternoon when we meet together, your number one goal is actually to drive accountability around this and are you making sure that we as leaders in the organization are doing the right thing for the company?" I think that's a philosophical construct that I always remind people in terms of what they should be doing. As an example, tomorrow we have calibrations, we have our annual review cycle happening in the company.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Good times. Always a blast.

Varun Parmar (01:06:23):
Yes, exactly, always fun and so critical as a leader, because it sets the tone for everything that you're going to do. In my opening remarks, the only thing I'm going to remind everyone in the room is that "Your number one goal here is to be a product leader and accountability is what you have to write. That's it. Just hold each other as accountable, including myself in terms of making sure that as we go in, that's the key thing." I think once people understand the duality of how they need to operate across those two specific goals, it actually leads to really high-performing teams and teams that actually are able to create somewhat of a magic if they are open and there is trust that has been built in the team.

Lenny (01:07:07):
When you say accountability, what does that look like? Is it pointing out, "Hey, you didn't achieve this thing we were trying to achieve" or "You didn't do a great job leading this meeting"? Is it just direct feedback often or is there some other way you see that manifested, and what do you like to see?

Varun Parmar (01:07:24):
Yeah, I think it's basically practicing feedback in a very open and constructive way and focusing on what is important for the business and not shying away from having some of those observations and conversations, not shying away from them. But it's all in the lens of what is the right thing to do for the business, and if you feel that that one or more members of the leadership team are not living up to what needs to be done, then just voicing it. It's not like you're complaining or anything, it's just like, "I have this perspective. Is this the right perspective or not?" Because actually it ties very well with the overall cultural values that we have.

(01:08:02):
If you do things with the lens that you are being empathetic, then you pose it as a question as opposed to a statement. I think that's one of the things that we practice a lot at Miro is that I believe that I am seeing there are certain things that are happening that it could be just me that I'm not seeing the other things. "But what is it? Can you help me understand? Can you help me figure out that why certain things are happening? Because I might just be missing the perspective." But because you bring it up, and that's part of practicing accountability in an empathetic way, it actually gets the entire team in the right mindset in terms of how they operate.

Lenny (01:08:39):
Has anyone given you some sort of direct feedback recently or pointed out something you didn't do well that held you accountable that you can share?

Varun Parmar (01:08:47):
All the time. Yeah, all the time. When we do our offsites, this is actually a fun thing, is that every offsite that I do with my leadership team, usually there is a one to two hour session where it is feedback to Varun, and I actually do it openly. I will have about eight to 10 people in the room and I will force people to be very honest and I want to show my vulnerabilities to everyone, that I am not perfect and I have lots of areas to improve. Every time people do it, it's interesting that they open up in very amazing ways and I think I love it because it helps me become better. It helps me identify my blind spots. But what it does is, because I do it in an open way, it brings a lot of trust. It brings trust that I do it openly and I'm an open book and they can share whatever they want, not just with me but openly in front of everyone.

Lenny (01:09:43):
Are you willing to share one thing they suggested that they pointed out that they wish you did differently or better?

Varun Parmar (01:09:48):
Yeah, I think in general, finding time with me tends to be a bit of a hard thing, and generally there's always this feedback, which is need more time, maybe more responsiveness over email or Slack or something like that. That's an area that I'm constantly working on and improving, so yeah.

Lenny (01:10:11):
That feels like a cop out. That doesn't feel too painful to hear. I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't have a lot of time. I'm sorry." But I get it, and that comes back to your point about blockers and how important it's to unblock teams because that leads to a lot faster progress.

Varun Parmar (01:10:26):
That's true, that's true.

Lenny (01:10:28):
Okay, so let me shift a little bit to Miro's growth and I only have a few questions here. I know it's getting late on your side so I don't want to keep you too long.

Varun Parmar (01:10:34):
Sure.

Lenny (01:10:35):
The first is something I'm on this constant quest to understand how companies got their first users, and I haven't actually heard the story of how Miro got its first thousand users or customers. I know you weren't there in the early days, but you happen to know how Miro initially grew and got their first thousand users and customers?

Varun Parmar (01:10:53):
I think the fundamental thing there is that we always had user first approach and reaching out to certain communities that were relevant to what was a key part of lighting the fire, if you will, the proverbial way people start to talk about the product. Given the collaborative nature of the product, some of the early adopters invited people who were also early adopters and the flywheel started to work. I've heard that we did a fair amount of content marketing and listing the product on sites like Capterra sort of helped. There was some early investments in terms of SEO and organic growth, so there was a focus there, which was the main source of driving traffic. The top of the funnel came through that.

(01:11:43):
The product teams were very intensely focused on building vital loops as a key mechanism of driving growth, once the traffic came in. Every interaction that actually introduced barrier, they looked at it and they looked at the data and they said, "Let's reduce this barrier. Let's remove this thing so that the product could be effectively embraced." It was an evolution over a period of time. There was also the fact that early on in the journey, some of the features were presented on a trial basis and then later on the model was evolved from a trial basis, time limited to a premium model that further accelerated the growth for the business. I would say those were some of the approaches that were taken to get to the first thousand users or so.

Lenny (01:12:34):
You talked about how Miro grows, where it has this magical loop of "I use Miro to for myself, then I share it with my team in whatever way I'm using it." They're like, "Oh, Miro, this is cool." Then they start using it and then they share it with people that they want to work with, and it creates this loop of growth." I imagine that's how Miro mostly grew initially and continues to grow. Is there anything surprising or unintuitive about how Miro grows that is beyond that? I imagine sales is a part of it and we can talk about that, but is there anything else that is interesting that is worth mentioning?

Varun Parmar (01:13:07):
No, I think that's the key of the growth. I think there are specific use cases where they are uniquely sort of geared towards inviting a lot of new people. For example, Miro is loved as a workshopping tool, and so generally one person is using Miro, but they invite 10, 15, 20, 50, 200, 300 people to that workshop. There are specific use cases where people get introduced to the product and then go and sign up for it and then start to use it for that use case or other use cases. I think the other accelerant in all of this is the templates that we have, in particular the role that Miroverse plays in all of this.

(01:13:49):
Just to give you an example here, there was a template which was created around FIFA World Cup, so there was a FIFA World Cup diagram. Cornelius, he's the founder and managing director of a Canadian strategic service design consultancy firm. He created this Miroverse template and it had over 100,000 views and about 15,000 copies were made of the single template. Given the popularity of all of this, it actually got indexed by Google. When you went in the search, you actually saw the Miroverse FIFA template show up when you were trying to search for FIFA World Cup, and that was another sort of acquisition channel top of funnel that actually drew a lot of users to it. So I think I would say the Miroverse is also a key accelerant to this.

Lenny (01:14:45):
If you had to think about the pie chart of how Miro grows, what percentage roughly would you say is word of mouth, organic, versus what you just described, which is essentially a CO versus sales, outbound sales? How do you think about that? Is there a way to model that simply?

Varun Parmar (01:15:02):
Without getting into specific numbers and stuff, I would say fundamentally Miro is a product-led growth company and product channels are one of the highest contributors for growth of users. As the business has evolved to serve the needs of some of the largest corporations in the world, the enterprise segment and the enterprise persona when they're trying to provision Miro for tens of thousands of users who then go conduct hundreds of thousands of workshops on Miro that invite millions of users on the platform, is a key part of the flywheel that we are seeing. I would say product channels are probably very strong and increasingly enterprise is a key part of that acceleration.

Lenny (01:15:53):
A great segue to our final question, which is the idea that you started a product growth, sounds like clearly it's a big part of growth today, but as every product growth company does eventually you have a large sales team, I imagine, what have you learned as a product leader working with sales, especially at a product growth company about how to make that relationship work and have a product work effectively with a sales org?

Varun Parmar (01:16:15):
There are a few learnings and I would say maybe this is one area where we are working on how we could be doing better in terms of bringing ourselves closer to our high-touch and bringing high-touch closer to self-serve, in terms of how we operate overall. It's a lot of hard work, I would say first of all, basically, to bring both of these organizations together and you have to be very deliberate around the points of intersection and you have to make sure that these organizations don't consider themselves as competition. It's one product, one company, just two channels of how we are serving our customers. There's some things that we've done which is have the product marketing team that basically works across both of these functions and make sure that they are bridging what we are hearing from the sales organization in terms of what directly customers need on the enterprise side, and then what do we need on the self-serve side.

(01:17:23):
There's a full process in terms of how the handoff happens across the maturity of the account. It can start as a self-serve, it drives adoption, and once there's adoption, there's a hand raiser that happens and then there's a sales rep that gets engaged and you go through the qualification process and then you have an opportunity to expand the account. We've over the years sort of architected and built the entire funnel and what the process is, and that's also sort of a key part of how all of this operates. But like I said, I think there are a few areas where we could further streamline how we operate and think of it as one single unit.

Lenny (01:18:05):
I imagine that is true for every company out there.

Varun Parmar (01:18:07):
Yes.

Lenny (01:18:09):
One maybe final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. What are some features that people could look forward to that are coming with Miro?

Varun Parmar (01:18:19):
We recently, about a month ago, announced Miro AI, the backdrop of all the amazing work that's happening around generative AI and large language models and stuff. I think it was really, really exciting to see all of the community enthusiasm around the use cases that we launch. So we're going to be taking it across the finish line and doing a general availability in the coming weeks and months. I think that's one big thing and we'll be adding more capabilities there. Just today we actually announced a bunch of really deep enhancements and updates around how Miro can be used for team rituals and agile practices. Now you can actually do retrospectives in Miro where you can have a private mode where while Lenny's typing his feedback during retrospective, nobody else can see it and then one click you can reveal it. I just saw some of the results of the feedback and it was rated as the number one feature people saw.

(01:19:14):
There's also some deeper integrations in terms of bringing an entire program board from Jira to start to do dependency mapping inside of Miro in a fun and collaborative way, to use this dependency mapping along with program board to start to do program increment planning, which is essentially scrum of scrums or big room planning that's happening. There's some really amazing capabilities that we've added there, which is on the backdrop of some of the updates we've made in terms of estimation of sprint story points and so on and so forth. Now there's a whole plethora of capabilities and apps that are available as part of the platform that allow you to have your entire team conduct your team rituals in Miro and you can automate certain things, you can streamline things, you can do certain things in async and then do the rest in synchronous ways, so I think that's been a big update as well.

Lenny (01:20:12):
Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Varun Parmar (01:20:19):
Yes.

Lenny (01:20:20):
All right, let's do it. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Varun Parmar (01:20:26):
One is, I love this, When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. It's one of those really emotional books that at the end of it, you might have tears in your eyes, but really, really amazing. We talked about Frank Slootman's Amp It Up, and then Satya Nadella's Hit Refresh. I think philosophically some of the things that we talked about today are inspirations that I found in some of these books.

Lenny (01:20:49):
What's a recent favorite movie or TV show?

Varun Parmar (01:20:52):
Ted Lasso. I don't know if it's a recent one or not, but something-

Lenny (01:20:55):
It's a new season.

Varun Parmar (01:20:57):
Yeah, I've enjoyed a lot. I think it's a very positive and uplifting message. I think the performance is huge. It's humorous, the characters are well-developed, so I think overall it's a treat, at least for, me to watch.

Lenny (01:21:13):
What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?

Varun Parmar (01:21:16):
I actually ask a math problem. For those of you who interviewed with me, I have this math problem, which is based on how Adobe created its first Creative Suite bundle. I was actually part of the team that came up with the pricing and packaging for the first Creative Suite post-acquisition of Macromedia. It's a math problem that allows you very quickly to figure out people in terms of their problem-solving skills. Usually I give that problem to people. I've given it to, I don't know, 700, 800 people, so I now have a very, very well established standard distribution of how long it takes for people, where do they get stuck and where they've gotten stuck, for those people I've hired, what evidence do I have in terms of using that as a framework in terms of them being able to solve things? So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:22:08):
So you're saying you've mapped back people that have done a certain way on the problem with their success and you've kind of found that it's a good signal of their performance?

Varun Parmar (01:22:17):
Yes. Not directly, but yes, correlation and stuff.

Lenny (01:22:21):
That's amazing. That's one of the biggest problems with interviewing. You think you're asking all these amazing questions and it's such a good signal, you have no idea. No one goes back and is like, "Oh, this person sucked. This person didn't... " That's really cool to get that much data on that one question. Two more questions for you. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in how you do product development that has had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute?

Varun Parmar (01:22:44):
We talked about some of that, sort of removing the roadblocks. I think having this motto of great customer value faster with high quality, just the simplicity of that and it's actually part of our evaluation rubric, it's part of how we measure ourselves and stuff. So I think just coming up with these simple concepts that you can rally the organization around, and I think it's still a work in progress, but something that I believe is leading to positive outcomes.

Lenny (01:23:07):
Final question. What's your favorite Miro template?

Varun Parmar (01:23:10):
It's the FIFA World Cup actually. I am so fascinated with what was done. Yeah, it's the latest one, but I think there's a bunch of them in terms of retros as well, and I think... like your template as well.

Lenny (01:23:21):
Amazing. We will link to all of those. Varun, this was amazing. Everything I expected and more, your team is as interesting and unique as I thought, and I am excited for people to learn from you and we're going to share a lot of links alongside this episode in the show notes. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Varun Parmar (01:23:43):
Thank you, Lenny. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed our interaction. You folks can find me online on LinkedIn. I think that's probably the best way to connect with me. I think in terms of one or two things I can ask everyone is that, one is if you are an existing Miro user and you use the product for something interesting, I highly encourage you to contribute it as a template as part of Miroverse. There's a lot of folks who use that and we would love for you to contribute there. The second thing is, I know a lot of product development teams, PMs and designers are big fans of you, Lenny, so those are also the users that use Miro. If there's anything we could do to make the product better, if there's things that you feel like we can expand the platform into, we would love to hear from you and just reach out to me directly over LinkedIn, direct message or connect with me there and yeah, and let us know. We're here to serve.

Lenny (01:24:40):
Amazing. Varun, thank you again for being here.

Varun Parmar (01:24:43):
Thanks, Lenny. Awesome.

# An inside look at Mixpanel’s product journey | Vijay Iyengar

## Transcript

Vijay Iyengar (00:00):
The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself right for disruption in your core because someone else can out invests you in that core. And so if you are the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invests everyone else in that core and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
Lenny (00:40):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Vijay Iyengar. Vijay is currently head of product at Mixpanel. He actually has a very similar career trajectory to myself where he started as an eng intern at Amazon. Then he was an engineer for a while at Uber, then he became an eng manager at Mixpanel. But then he shifted from an ENG manager to director of product, and now head of product at Mixpanel. You don't often see people moving from an leadership role straight to director of product, so it was really interesting to hear what he took from his eng experience and brought into his approach to product leadership. But we spent the bulk of our time talking about what he's learned from the journey that Mixpanel has been on, where they started with a simple product, then scaled to a number of different products, solving many problems for customers, and then made the hard decision to scale back to just a single core focused analytics product.
(01:33):
We talk about why they made that choice, what they learned about when it makes sense to expand a new product and when you probably shouldn't, and how they approach that organizationally. We also talk about how Mixpanel builds product, how they think about products philosophy, how they prioritize, and also what you're probably doing wrong in how you set up your analytics for your own product. With that, I bring you Vijay Iyengar after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming subjective bias, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards, resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. Vijay, welcome to the podcast.
Vijay Iyengar (03:52):
Thank you, Lenny. Great to be here. Huge fan of the pod, and so glad I can contribute.
Lenny (03:57):
I definitely want to talk about Mixpanel's journey both as a product team and a product. But before we get there, as an engineer, you were in a longtime engineer and then you became a product leader, is there anything you had to unlearn as an engineer in the way you thought about leadership and product and business?
Vijay Iyengar (04:13):
One of the things after you've been in engineering for a while is that develop this tendency to immediately respond with no to new ideas. And I think from the engineering perspective, this is because you spend a lot of your time building and maintaining ideas that maybe are half thought out or didn't really go anywhere, and you just feel like the full brunt of the maintenance cost of that. And so you build up the scar tissue and this immune response to say no to new ideas, and it's a hard no, like no, we're definitely not going to do it. And I think I had to unlearn that moving into product because you get a lot of ideas coming from a lot more places in the organization, and ideas are fragile in their agency and it's a hard no can really kill a whole direction that you could potentially go.
(04:55):
They could be very high reach and high impact. So, one thing that I've found is the best way to get to a no, if you ultimately need to get there, is to try to make it work. Start trying to make yes work and document how you've tried to make yes work. And do that earnestly, not as an exercise of just an alternative that you're considering. Try to do it sincerely and get to know after trying to make yes work. And so that's one thing I've been trying to just apply my engineer problem solving brain to do that instead of thinking about how it might not work and saying no.
Lenny (05:25):
Is that something that you recommend engineers work on looking back? I know as a PM, it's like, oh, I love when engineers say yes. This is awesome. I'm going to actually help everyone learn to say yes. But as an engineer, obviously that's a challenge often. What do you recommend to folks that are engineers currently that maybe want to improve on this or shift in how they think about saying yes, saying no when they're asked about something new?
Vijay Iyengar (05:48):
I think some of the best engineers that I've worked with actually already do this, but [inaudible 00:05:53] they're able to balance both in their head. So, ultimately this balancing act, you just want on-call, you were woken up three times at 3:00 AM due to various bad ideas, and the next morning you wake up and then stand up, it's like, "Hey, can we do this new thing?" You kind of have to have that empathy and do that. So yeah, I think the exercise is just take 10 minutes to consider the idea and just sincerely consider how might we make it work. And if at the end of those 10 minutes, it's like futile and there's no path, it's fine to say no. And it's a good instinct to say no, actually in a lot of cases. But yeah, I would recommend that to engineers. I think it would've been better in my career, for sure, if I had learned that sooner.
Lenny (06:26):
I want to spend some time on the Mixpanel product journey. It's been an interesting rollercoaster. I think the company's been around for how many years? Since 2010? 2009?
Vijay Iyengar (06:34):
20009, yeah.
Lenny (06:35):
So, I know it started as kind of a very simple product analytics product back in the day. And then as you do with ambitious companies, you look for more problems to solve. You look for more problems to solve from your customers. So as I understand it, you guys added a lot more products to the suite of Mixpanel products. And then I know that there are some challenges with scaling that, and maybe the products didn't stick as much as you're hoping. And what I understand is recently, you moved back to just the single core analytics product. And so I'd love to just hear that journey of what that process was like, what you learned as a product leader and as a company about scaling, expanding, trying to solve a lot of problems, and then coming back to one core straightforward problem.
Vijay Iyengar (07:15):
Mixpanel started in 2009 as provide product analytics to EPD teams. And I think early on, it saw a lot of success because it built this in-house database called Arb, which stands for arbitrary segmentation. And that was necessary because events data, which is the fuel for product analytics, is few orders of magnitude larger than most other types of data that people collect, and so you need a specialized approach to deal with it. And so that I think spurred the first wave of explosive growth, because product analytics was a really burning problem at the time. People were shipping mobile apps like crazy and they needed a solution that could scale, and that was kind of a durable mode for Mixpanel for a while. And I think because we had this SDK that was installed in so many apps and we had this really scalable event collection and analytic interface, it was just natural to expand into a few adjacencies that would leverage those same technologies.
(08:04):
So, the first one was messaging, being able to send targeted messages to users, which is something that's fairly natural, you might want to do, especially if you have an SDK already installed. Yeah. The other aspect that we've added into was data infrastructure and trying to be the single source of truth of data in companies. And what ended up happening was that by 2018, we had this big churn problem. We had something like 40% churn, revenue churn, our core product. And when we dug into, it wasn't that people were churning because they didn't need product analytics anymore. They had the need. They were just churning to competition because we were just not up to the market in terms of the features we had in our core. And when we dug into why that was, it was just that we had a 50% engineering team that was building products across three domains, product analytics, messaging, and data engineering stuff.
(08:52):
Our engineering team was just spread too thin to address all of those core gaps in functionality. And so we made a really hard call at the time. We said the hard no to those two other categories and decided to focus our entire engineering team on closing the gap on product analytics and innovating there. And from a process standpoint, how we operationalize this was we threw away all our planning and all the execution and that we work that we'd planned to do so far, and we did something very simple. We took all the churn reasons that our customer success and sales teams had been painstakingly collecting for years, grouped them by category, which was roughly product features we needed to build, sorted descending by ARR, took the top 10 things and made that our roadmap, just give every engineer direct access to customers and give them a bucket to go work on, which I think goes against about a million product best practices out there of just doing that.
(09:41):
But I think given the context at the time, we needed to optimize for speed, and speed comes when you have extreme clarity on what you want to do and focus. And so we really just optimize for speed in that time. And so in that first year we moved really quickly and we shipped something like a hundred features in that year and closed a lot of gaps. Again, these are all vanity metrics. Measuring number of features doesn't mean anything.
Lenny (10:04):
And what year was this by the way?
Vijay Iyengar (10:06):
This is 2018 to 2019.
Lenny (10:09):
Got it.
Vijay Iyengar (10:09):
Yeah. So, we moved really fast shipping all these features and instantly saw the improvements to win rate and to retention. But one of the cracks that started to emerge was we neglected the holistic design of our product at the time, right? And if you're shipping features that quick leads, you don't have time to stop and think, where does this go, and how does this fit into our overall system architecture? And what started to happen was that we were hitting diminishing returns with some of these features. And not considering the holistic design and consistency meant the reach of every feature was low. You had to rebuild it for every part of the product that we were in. And so at the time we made... We spun up the second stream that was very design led. And I think this was also coincided around the time we adopted Figma, and it's a really broad design at seat at the table of the company, and we just set up this goal to make design one of our key differentiators.
(10:53):
So, this design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step? And then how will users discover them and how do they relate to each other? But I think this realization was born out of the fact that so many great products win or lose based on their architecture. I think Notion, for example, that pages in blocks architecture is so strong, and you can hang so many features off of those core building blocks in a way that has such high impact on region and discovery of those features.
(11:26):
So anyway, we did that in parallel with the.... And continued that grind on core jabs. And so the end result of that phase, which is from 2018 to maybe late 2021, 2022, was our retention went from about 60% to 90%, and our NPS went from 16 to 50. So I think, yeah, there's a lot in there to unpack, but refocusing on the core really helped us achieve those results.
Lenny (11:52):
Got it. Yeah. I have a lot of questions about this. So interesting. So, that phase that you went through where you sorted things by potential ARR, was that the phase of expanding to multiple products or that was post we're going to focus on analytics and go all in there?
Vijay Iyengar (12:06):
Oh, that was post focusing on analytics.
Lenny (12:08):
Okay.
Vijay Iyengar (12:08):
Yeah. Yeah.
Lenny (12:09):
And you're saying that you had a stream of just builds all the features that were lacking that are causing customers to churn, and in parallel, there was a track of let's build this product, such that it all connects and works together well and it's really well thought through long term?
Vijay Iyengar (12:24):
The first thing, I might have made it seem like it was just the buckets were features. We did take the step of turning them into problems and being clear, exposing engineers directly to the customers that had those problems and then invent a solution to solve them. So I mean, loosely there were features involved, but a lot of them were kind of core problems we needed to solve.
Lenny (12:40):
That first approach is so interesting. It's kind of like, yes, we will make more money if we focus on these features. To your point, it ends up being just a bunch of features and products that kind of maybe don't synergize. Looking back, was that a good idea to approach it that way, at least for a while?
Vijay Iyengar (12:54):
It highly depends on your context. In a very competitive context where there are just table stakes features that customers need and that it's been validated by the market, you need to optimize for speed more so than anything else. But it is an approach that outlives it's usefulness pretty fast, and we've put that approach behind us relatively quickly after that phase. And I would actually say that design driven phase was the next phase, where it was, okay, we're not bleeding on the table stakes anymore, but we want to make a holistic product that has high reach, high impact on the features and is actually usable. And so that was I think a follow-on phase that's necessary. Obviously, depending on your particular circumstances and competitive dynamics, you can sequence them differently, but I think it was the right call to just... Sort of the on-call thing again where when you're in trouble, you got to get out of trouble. You can't mow your lawn while your house is on fire. You kind of put out the fire and then deal with everything else.
Lenny (13:47):
Yeah.
Vijay Iyengar (13:47):
So, that's kind of the approach we took.
Lenny (13:49):
What's an example of a feature or product that you launched within that first track? And then what's an example of something that came out of the designer led approach, if anything comes to mind?
Vijay Iyengar (14:00):
I think out of the first track, oh man, there's so many that were just core. We didn't have a good cohorts product at the time, just being able to create behavioral cohorts users and create them from any report that we built, right? And I think that, I mean it's just table stakes and analytics to be able to do that. So, that was one of the first things we built, and it was fairly obvious. There's a lot of other things in more advanced types of funnel analytics and a flows and visualization that was really interactive. I think on the design-led phase, the biggest thing I think was visualization consistency and making our charts interactive in a consistent way across our entire product. And so there's two things that enabled. One was that every time we added a new visualization or a new enhancement to a visualization or how something is sorted in one report, it just instantly applied everywhere.
(14:46):
So, just the reach was multiplied for everything we added. And the other thing is it just made the product more accessible, let us add dark mode. So, it made our visualizations really stunning and really easy to see what the takeaways were. And then every new visualization we added inherited all those benefits.
Lenny (14:59):
I'm trying to think about being at a company that goes through this phase of, "Hey, we're just going to build a bunch of stuff that we know we need." And it feels like hearing it, it's like, "Oh yeah, and then we're just going to make it all look great and connect and work well." I imagine that wasn't planned, and I imagine that wasn't easy to get people to maybe slow down on just building more products and features or push it in a direction where it's all going to make sense. Can you talk at all about what that process was, how hard it was to shift from we're just going to knock through all this checklist of things to let's just bigger, let's slow down, let's spend a lot of time designing?
Vijay Iyengar (15:35):
It was definitely more messy internally than I described it. One of the key junctures was when we had this really talented design team and we were putting them on these very tactical projects that was, frankly, that was very engineering led, right? And design would often come in at the end and be asked like, "Hey, can you just make this look nice and put some pixels on it?" And it's just such a waste of your design team to have them do that. But at the same time, the pace was so high that they didn't have time to come up for air and do anything else. And so there's actually this moment where I was an engineering manager at part of this.
(16:05):
And had a meeting with our BM and our head of design at the time, and we said, "Hey, we can actually do the next three months of projects about any design," which was a kind of controversial thing to say, "but we're doing this so that you can take three months with a set of designers and go think about the system architecture of the product, and we'll wait for that to be done before we do any architectural things that might impact the architecture." And I think that gave designers a bit of breathing room to go do that, just separating them for a bit from the tactical fire. Because what was happening instead was we would get towards the end of the project, bring design in, and they would use each project as an opportunity to squeeze in like, oh, and we can simplify here. And that's just a classic way to blow up scope at the end of the project because there wasn't a dedicated space for design led projects.
(16:48):
And I think that that was kind of a key friction point that we ultimately had to decouple for a bit, and then regroup and say, "Okay, now we'll look what's our strategy," and just take on projects purely for the sake of improving consistency, reach depth of our UX.
Lenny (17:02):
Also, looking back, the process you went through adding a bunch of products to solve more customer problems, something every founder and product team thinks about, when should we add new product lines? When should we expand beyond the core? I'm curious what you take away as a lesson and what you'd advise other founders and companies when it comes to when is the time to expand and think about a new product and a third product and a fourth product?
Vijay Iyengar (17:28):
I don't know if there's a hard and fast rule here. I can just maybe say what made sense and didn't make sense in our context. The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself ripe for disruption in your core because someone else can out invest you in that core. And so if you, you're the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invest everyone else in that core, and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.
(18:10):
And the other aspect of that is that those secondary products we took on were in categories of their own. And it's really tempting and you'll often get dragged into accidentally entering another category, and then you'll end up building these bolt-on products that are the best in their category, right? And the adjacent categories for analytics are CDPs or message targeting or feature flagging or something, but there's not that many people that need the sixth best CDP or the eighth best feature flagging or the 10th best message targeting tool. And it ends up being, in aggregate will contribute five to 10% to your revenue, won't seriously accelerate your growth rate, and then takes engineers away from the core product. And so those were the circumstances that we were.
(18:50):
And I think if you're seeing churn to your competitor on your core product and you're not best in class on any of the other ones, then maybe it's time to reevaluate. And then the last thing I'll say there is that it's also 10x more painful than you think to cut mild successes than anything else, and just organizationally painful. And there's teams that have whole roadmaps, and it's a really painful experience, so you have to think really hard before you kick those off.
Lenny (19:18):
That is really, really insightful advice, makes me think about if you bundle good enough solutions, there needs to be kind of this anchored tenant that I will not give this thing up and I'll use the third best version of something else, if you have it. But if you're not that valuable and important, you're not going to convince people to use something because they're competing against the best in every category.
Vijay Iyengar (19:39):
Exactly. Yeah.
Lenny (19:40):
That is really interesting. I've been doing this kind of series on how different companies approach building product and I have a few questions I'd love to ask around the product development process and Mixpanel.
Vijay Iyengar (19:50):
Sure.
Lenny (19:51):
The first is just like, how do you plan? How do you plan? I know it evolves, but just how do you plan currently? How long are your planning cycles? How far ahead do you plan in detail? Do you use OKRs? Maybe let's start there, those three kind of sub-questions.
Vijay Iyengar (20:04):
We have these unsolved problems and analytics that we're going after. For us that’s like, people always want more power, more simplicity, better data trust, faster onboarding, better collaboration, better price performance. And so we largely organize our teams around those problems and those missions. One quick aside there is that some of those problems have attention with each other. Power and simplicity, there's a trade off there, right? And we want one team to own both, so that they're kind of forced to confront that tension and beat that trade off. And so that's kind of how we think about generally our product team, is these cross-functional EPD teams, each of which that's focused on solving these long-lived paired problems for customers [inaudible 00:20:41] our core analysis team focused on that power, simplicity, trade off problem. In terms of planning, the way it works is that we plan on a six month time horizon. And I can talk about our most recent planning cycle actually, because we're just completing it.
Lenny (20:53):
Yeah, let's do it.
Vijay Iyengar (20:54):
Yeah, basically it started out with this strategy memo that our leadership team wrote that basically just conveys this is where we want to go as a company in the next year, and here's how the product team can contribute most of that and just established these key pillars. We shared that with the teams, and they took that and also combined that with all the quantitative and qualitative context they're constantly consuming about the problem they're working on and our customers, and ideated and developed the series of bets for the next six months, which I think are some extent similar to OKRs, where ABET... The anatomy of ABET is that it's problem we want to solve, our hypothesis on the solution, and then some plan to win, some plan to actually get there and a way to measure that you got there.
(21:32):
And I think one of the unique things that we did relative to other companies that do planning is... I think it usually is sort of this W process of there's the strategy memo, and then teams generate bets and there's a review, and then they go back and I iterate and then they finalize. And we kind of collapsed the middle part of the W where myself and our head of design actually spend time with each of the teams actually ideating on the bets and participating in the solution discovery process, going into the jam sessions and adding fig must keys ourselves with ideas and thoughts on things, which we did because we aren't a huge product team, and we are not going to do 50 things and a half. We're going to do maybe 10 to 12 things.
(22:12):
And so that's enough that we don't... We can do something that doesn't scale if that enables high bandwidth communication between us and the teams. And it ends up being more messy and unstructured ABET in that phase because we're in there contributing ideas as well. But by the end of it, I think the team leaves feeling both more competent in their bets because there's more thought that's gone into it, and then more aligned top to bottom line why we made certain decisions. And so I think that that's one thing that's different. And then we conclude that process with the roadshow where we presented the rest of the company, and then get their feedback as well.
Lenny (22:41):
How long is this process generally?
Vijay Iyengar (22:43):
The teams did pre-work for a couple of weeks, like two weeks in December, and then we did a two week sort of sprint on solutioning and ideation in January, the first two weeks of January.
Lenny (22:53):
Awesome. And what's the end result of planning for each team? Did they deliver a document with, here's our strategy, here's the big bets, here's a roadmap? Is there a template you pass around? How do you get to a thing that people share and present and comment on?
Vijay Iyengar (23:10):
Yeah, I think there's basically three artifacts that are kind of linked to each other. So, the first is we use Notion, and so we have a database in notion called bets, which is where each page in the database is [inaudible 00:23:22]. And that has a template, yeah. So, it's kind of roughly what I described with a few more sections of what problem we're solving? What's the evidence of demand? What's the region impact of this problem? How do we know we're successful? And then what's the key driving hypothesis behind the solution? And then a rough line. And then that's tied with a presentation that's kind of like a tight summary of that that has one slide per bet, and then is also tied with more of an execution focused, how do we sequence and staff this thing and eliminate dependencies, which the engineering team contributes to. So, I think those are the three artifacts that are linked together.

(25:08):
I know you have some insights on prioritization and some strong opinions on how to prioritize. Can you talk a bit about that and how you advise your product teams to prioritize?
Vijay Iyengar (25:17):
One really common framework in prioritization is RICE, reach, impact, confidence, effort. And I think it's simple and fairly robust, which is generally good qualities of a framework. But one of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets, really innovative things. And we encountered this on one of our teams early last year were we just RICE'd everything, all the ideas, and a lot of the high reach, high impact things ended up at the bottom because confidence and effort were just so murky for them, as they should be typically for high reach, high impact ideas.
(25:55):
And so one exercise that we push our teams on is just ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas with engineers and designers in the room committed to actually trying to solve them. Give it a fair shot. And you'll often find if you spend a week on that set of ideas, you can get pretty far in understanding the confidence and the effort. You can probably find a higher confident lower effort way to do them. Then add the C and E back in, and then RICE as usual. And the goal is to end up with a reasonable mix of innovative bets, incremental bets, and then ones that are technical debt or product debt that you need to address.
Lenny (26:31):
I usually just cut out the C myself. I find that it's not that powerful. Do you do this in a Google Sheet? Do you use this in Notion? How do you actually recommend teams do this prioritization, or just eyeball it?
Vijay Iyengar (26:43):
I'm not super opinionated on the exact tools that teams use. I think this is a team local exercise typically, but most teams use Notion and just simple tables or databases in Notion-
Lenny (26:51):
Sweet.
Vijay Iyengar (26:52):
... work fine for this. I think the other thing on prioritization that's always tricky is estimation. And every engineer will value you estimates are all lies, and if you say it'll take eight weeks, it'll take eight months. But I think the core problem with estimation is you're asked to estimate things before what the thing is, and it's just a strange output to be expected to produce. And one approach that I found really interesting is from this book called Shape Up by Basecamp, which this idea of appetite overestimates, where instead of making the estimate an output of planning, you make the time box or an appetite the input, and you say, "We want to solve X problem and we're willing to invest six weeks solving that problem."
(27:31):
The obvious question there is how do you pick that time window? It just seems arbitrary. And so the base camp people suggest just pick six weeks for everything, and they're really austere about if you can't scope hammer something down to six weeks, you're doing it wrong, which I think is... It can work and has a lot of benefits if you creates a rhythm in your company, but one approach I found that works better is pick a reasonable sounding appetite and just explore the two to three options around it. Pick six weeks, and then say, "What would we do differently if we only had four weeks or eight weeks?" And you'll kind of naturally find the efficient frontier of cost and impact, and then align on that. And the important thing is that you check in after that time period and say, "Is there any new information that's just we should continue? Did we uncover the biggest risks, and are we just on the long tail of things?" And actually be honest with yourself about that. I think that's important regardless of what framework you use.
Lenny (28:23):
I really like that. So, is that how you actually operate, you create a time box, we have four weeks for this project, whatever we get done, we ship whatever we don't, we push out?
Vijay Iyengar (28:30):
We operated that way in engineering, particularly on the infrastructure side, because we have this series of projects that would just take forever, and the longer it takes, the longer it's going to take. And so we've done that exercise quite a bit. I'd say more on the more engineering heavy projects than others, but we're starting to adopt it more in the product side as well. The main exercise we've taken on the product side is more the consider, what would you do differently with different time boxes approach?
Lenny (28:56):
Just a thought exercise.
Vijay Iyengar (28:58):
Yeah, it's a good thought exercise. Then it just forces everyone to truly score the requirements. Critical, nice to have, is nice, but really if in two weeks, you're going to get pulled off to do something completely different, what would be a complete solution that addresses the core problem. And it forces you to peel the meat of the problem in first, as opposed to just doing the things that are surrounding it.
Lenny (29:17):
That's cool. I really like that. I've done that myself. I'm curious if anyone ever does the shape up process for real or it's just like we will ship anything that is ready within six weeks and not actually have specific deadlines or kind of concrete goals of products they need to ship in specific ways.
Vijay Iyengar (29:32):
Yeah. Well, I think the shape up process, if you run it all the way. They do... Their idea is that you can actually predict on a six week time horizon. So, you can just hammer down scope to something that is complete. It needs to be complete. It can't be milestone one that's like a half baked thing in six weeks, which I think that rigor... The rigor they applied to that across the board, you need to do it all the way. You can't adopt the process halfway. I think the is the challenge. Otherwise you end up with people shipping milestone one and then moving on, which is not the complete product.
Lenny (30:01):
Makes sense. A couple more questions around how you build product. You mentioned that you have a unique approach to keeping product teams close to customers. And I'm curious what you've learned there, what you found to be helpful and just kind of keeping product teams close to your customers.
Vijay Iyengar (30:15):
I think this is one thing that is something we invested in pretty early on at Mixpanel. Actually around that time, in 2018, when we refocused on our core product, one of our sales engineers, Aaron, built this automation where he piped all these customer gaps that we got that were reported by our customer success and sales teams, piped that into Slack and just a feed. And what this created was this culture where all engineers and designers could consume that raw feed of direct points of customer with no gatekeeper, no process to access it, no pre-aggregation, right? And I think this scale's pretty far. At a product team of our scale and with our reach of customers, we don't get so much feedback that someone couldn't read it in 20 minutes every day. And for four or five years in engineering, every day I would read all the gaps that we got, and many engineers would do that.
(31:04):
And one of the rituals that it's enabled is we'll find that engineers will go into that channel and react with a message with an email emoji, which means I'm going to email this customer and find out more, right? And they'll just email the customer and say, "Hey, I'm the engineer that built this feature. I saw you said this specific thing. Can you tell me more? I'd love to understand." They ask the five why's, and then they improve the product on their own. And I think that culture is just so important, and it just empowers all engineers and designers to think a PM a little bit, which I think takes a little bit of a load off on the PM to be the gatekeeper of all that information.
(31:39):
And then over time, we've evolved it quite a bit as our data stack stack's involved. So, we now not just take customer requests, but we take things that are posted on Twitter and NPS survey feedback and win loss notes from our competitive deals and pipe them both into Slack and into Notion so that we can both get the realtime feed, and then we can sort and aggregate and tag things accordingly. But the key artifact of this is that it's all open. There's no gatekeeper behind that process.
Lenny (32:04):
That sounds both amazing and wild. Do you still allow engineers just to email customers and ask them questions about this stuff, or is that harder to do it as you've grown?
Vijay Iyengar (32:12):
Oh no, we still allow that. Yeah.
Lenny (32:14):
Wow, that's awesome.
Vijay Iyengar (32:15):
One nice thing about the stack actually, the data stack, is that... So, basically all these feeds information land in our data warehouse, which is BigQuery. And from there, they're pushed out via a reverse CTL tool we use called Census to Slack and Notion that make the note code. But one of the benefits of that is that we can enrich all of these feeds with who's the account? What's their ARR? Who's the CSM? And all that other contact information. So, it's usually not an engineer's blindly reaching out to a customer without letting a CSM know if it's a million dollar account or something. The idea is just trust them with that context, and they can tag the right people and make the right call on that.
Lenny (32:50):
I'm so curious how that gets prioritized and how PMs are looped into all that, but we don't have to get too deep in that. That's a really cool process. I haven't seen that before. Our engineers were just emailing customers, digging into questions and problems.
Vijay Iyengar (33:01):
The trap of course is what you just called out is you can't be reacting to everything all the time. And certainly if you ship a redesign, the first two weeks of that, there's going to be a bunch of feedback that's like, I hate this. Go back. And I think that's sort of an organizational muscle you have to build, balance the reaction, and that's just a thing we've had to practice doing, but I think the trade offs are worth it.
Lenny (33:20):
Awesome. One last question along these lines, can you just talk about the tools you use, the SaaS products you use to run your product team for collaboration, communication, notes, docs. You mentioned Notion as an example.
Vijay Iyengar (33:31):
I think our stack is actually fairly standard these days. So, we have Slack, Zoom for communication, Notion for docs and any long form writing, and it's a [inaudible 00:33:42] database, and Figma and FigJam for design and whiteboarding. I think what's actually more interesting is our data stack and the productivity we get out of that. I briefly touched on this, where basically all of our data gets EPL'd out of all the systems we have, lands in BigQuery, gets joined and modeled, and then pushed out via census to all the other tools in our stack. And I think that's been a huge productivity unlock because you can build internal tools with very little code. If you can write SQL, you can build an internal tool basically, and that pushes information to the teams that need it. And so that, I think, just has unlocked a lot of these types of things like automating qualitative signals with no code in a reliable way.
(34:22):
And then if someone like, "Oh, can I get ARR on this?" Yeah, sure it takes two seconds to do that. So, I think that data stack has been a huge productivity unlock for us.
Lenny (34:29):
Awesome. Have you guys shared that anywhere online, just to show kind of the stack you guys have built?
Vijay Iyengar (34:33):
We have a couple blog posts that talks about our stack for... We use this both for our PLG infrastructure and our product, let sales, defining a PQL and alerting a new user who fits that criteria, but then we also use it for internal tools. We have a few blog posts on that topic.
Lenny (34:48):
Sweet. We'll follow up and include some of that in the show notes.
Vijay Iyengar (34:51):
Yeah, definitely.
Lenny (34:53):
Final line of questioning, you're one of the smartest people in the world on product analytics heading product for Mixpanel. I'm curious what you think most people get wrong when they're setting up product analytics for their site, their product, their company.
Vijay Iyengar (35:08):
It's maybe a bit of a hot take because I think so many people-
Lenny (35:11):
There we go.
Vijay Iyengar (35:12):
Yeah, so many people still do this, but I think the biggest mistake is setting up analytics using client side SDKs, client side tracking. So, web and mobile SDKs, putting a mixpanel.track or segment.track in your web app or your mobile apps. And reason it's a hot take is that for many people that's product analytics and SDK tracking are synonymous. They're like, "All right, Mixpanel means SDK, I have to put an SDK in my web and mobile app. But that's a mistake because it... We've just seen time and time again, it leads to poor data quality and difficulty to maintain that data. So, the problem on web is, just due to app blockers and other unreliable things, in the JavaScript world, you end up dropping 20 to 30% of your events, and so it just doesn't match your internal databases.
(35:55):
And then on mobile there's two problems. The first is that you have to reinvent tracking for both iOS and Android because it's two different languages and two different platforms, generally speaking. And so you end up with many duplicate events that semantically mean the same thing, but are just different because of the two platforms, and you might have two teams owning that. And the second issue, which is I think even worse, is that you are kind of beholden to clients updating their mobile app to get to the latest version that has your latest tracking. So if you want to add new tracking, it'll only apply to people at the latest version and beyond. Whereas yet all of your old tracking, whether it's broken or you made a mistake, is still out there in the wild, and so you're constantly getting events that are old and broken.
(36:32):
And so what we recommend instead, and that we've seen a lot more customers adopt recently is just track events from your servers instead of your clients. And that has three benefits. One, it's instantly cross platform. Web and mobile and TV and whatever other platform, they're all going to go through your servers, so you instantly get a hundred percent reach. The second is it's in an environment you control. So if you want to update tracking, you can update it and updates for a hundred percent of users. And then the third thing is that... And this is I think maybe unintuitive, but it's true, is that engineers have been tracking events from servers forever. It's called logs, right? And events are just logs where they user ID in them. And so they don't need to deal with learning a new SDK and dealing with all of that. They just have to track logs that have some structure and a user ID in them. They're tracking events.
(37:18):
And so if it's easier for the developer, it'll get done in a higher quality way. So, I think the really simple advice there is just start tracking events from your servers instead of from your clients. And if you need to supplement it later on with context that's only on the client, you can add that on later, but server side should be the default.
Lenny (37:34):
Maybe a last question is just what's changed most and how companies work with analytics in the past few years? And then just where do you think things are going in the space of analytics?
Vijay Iyengar (37:43):
Yeah, so I think one huge trend is the rise of the data warehouse. So these are Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and they're really scalable and they speak this SQL standard, which has led to this explosion of tools that have emerged around them and make it really easy and cheap to load data into the data warehouse, and then also easy to push data out of the data warehouse by tools that can just do that. And this has a few implications. So, the first is that the data warehouse becomes the center of gravity for all data in your company. Whether it's product marketing and sales data, they all land there. And I think that's really valuable today in this product led growth world, and a lot of incus filled my bad. But from a data standpoint, that means all these teams need to be operating off of the same version of the truth, and that version of the truth is sitting in the warehouse, and it just needs to be joined correctly.
(38:33):
The second thing in terms of where things are going is the events, a time series of users at this action at this time, are the universal data model for analytics. And the reason for that is every action, every interaction a customer has, whether it's with your sales team, like a gong call, or with your marketing team, they clicked on that or viewed marketing article or their product, which is more well known, those are all events. They can all be modeled as events. And it's super granular, super intuitive as a way to understand what people are doing. And it's really powerful, because oftentimes you want to ask questions about sequences of events, right? Which user has spent this much time on my pricing page and then looked at three developer docs? That's probably a user I want to reach out to. So many things can be modeled off of that.
(39:17):
And so I think data warehouse is becoming the loading dock for all this data, which can be very easily modeled this events, but it's not a very great analytical tool for events because SQL is optimized for rows and tables and joints, and not events and sequences of events and segmentations of events. And so one of the things that we're spending a lot of time thinking about is how do we get that really rich, trusted, comprehensive dataset from the data warehouse into a tool that's optimized from the UI down to the data model for events, because that unlocks really fast intuitive exploration of data on dataset that people already have in trust? So, that's, I think, one of the big trends we're excited about and what we see as the future.
Lenny (39:56):
Interesting. And you think Mixpanel is in a good place to help people do that? Is that how see this, there's something that companies like yours will help people solve, or is this something everyone's going to have to figure out for themselves, or there's like a whole new class of startups launching to help them make the mess out of data warehouses?
Vijay Iyengar (40:11):
No, there's always a new class of startups joining in the analytics space. It's never dull moment. Yeah, I think this is something that we are looking to solve, because I mean, analytics only as good as the data. And if people are already collecting great data in the warehouse, I mean we integrate with the warehouse really well, then we get access to that good data. Increasingly, what we've been seeing is that companies like in the reverse ETL phase, like Census and Hightouch are effectively reinventing the CDP reinventing, data movement tool like segment on top of the data warehouse. And so really our strategy there is just tightening our integration with those tools. And we've seen just huge growth and people using their data warehouse as the source for events, not adding SDK tracking anywhere, and just saying, "I already have events sitting here. I trust all of them. They're from all parts of my business. Why can't I do analytics on my support tickets and my gong calls just as easily as I can do it about my user behavior." And so I think that's something we're seeing and we're investing in.
Lenny (41:04):
Awesome. Anything else you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Vijay Iyengar (41:09):
Yeah, we opened talking about the transition from engineering to product, and I think one of the things that's just been really fruitful in my career, both on the engineering side and product side, is just adopting that product mindset and getting closer to customers, consuming the raw feed of customer context, taking every opportunity to talk to them. And I'm really excited to see things like this podcast and your newsletter and other forums for engineers to also develop that product mindset then and get closer to customers, because I think long term, that just means better products and services at lower and lower prices, which is just innovation. So, I'm really excited to see more of that in the world.
Lenny (41:45):
Here, here. With that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got six quick questions for you. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast. Whatever comes to mind, just share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good?
Vijay Iyengar (41:57):
Sure. Let's do it.
Lenny (41:58):
Okay. What are couple books that you recommend most to other people?
Vijay Iyengar (42:02):
On the business book standpoint, there's this book called The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. And it's kind of an old book, but I like it because it's sort of written in this fast-paced thriller model. It's like a fiction book, but it's about this idea of the theory of constraints, finding constraints in a system and how you can remove them to improve productivity. So, I found it's just a fun read, and also really insightful non-technical books that I recommend to folks, particularly those that live in SF, which is Cool Gray City of Love by Gary Kamiya, who is a longtime SF president. And it just goes into the history and the communities, and even the geography of San Francisco, and I've just discovered so many little pockets in the city from reading that book, so it's something I recommend to people who live in San Francisco.
Lenny (42:46):
What's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than this podcast?
Vijay Iyengar (42:50):
I'll do non-tech one for this. So, I'm a huge fan of the show The West Wing, and so there's this podcast called The West Wing Weekly that goes into each episode of the West Wing and brings in actors from the show, as well as folks from government to talk about each episode, and it's just a delight to listen to if you love The West Wing.
Lenny (43:06):
Wait, so they go back to the old show, The West Wing and talk about old episodes with politicians?
Vijay Iyengar (43:11):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:12):
That's cool.
Vijay Iyengar (43:12):
Yeah.
Lenny (43:13):
Wow.
Vijay Iyengar (43:14):
Exactly. So, the show's over. The podcast is over.
Lenny (43:18):
Oh, okay.
Vijay Iyengar (43:18):
You have all seven seasons, but I think it started in 2016 or 2015 or something.
Lenny (43:22):
Got it. So cool. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Vijay Iyengar (43:27):
Pretty mainstream TV tastes. So, I really enjoyed We Crushed and Severance. Those are two good shows I really enjoyed last year.
Lenny (43:35):
Awesome. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're interviewing?
Vijay Iyengar (43:39):
I'm a big fan of open-ended questions, and so one of the questions I ask in the behavioral interview at the start is, walk me through the story of you from college to now, or high school to now, if they're a more junior candidate. And couple interesting things here, interesting to see where people spend most of their time talking and where they don't, and also how they describe the other people on that journey. And do they use a standard framework to describe everyone, or do they go into each person uniquely? So, just tons of follow up questions from that.
Lenny (44:09):
Final question is, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?
Vijay Iyengar (44:14):
Got a lot of inspiration from Gibson Biddle and his product strategy medium thing. And in particular, there's a piece on proxy metrics and the shape of metrics you should use, which I found is a really... The way he frames it is a really elegant way to measure, reach and impact at the same time of your metrics. And then also a big fan of Shishir from Coda, specifically his essays liaison on [inaudible 00:44:37] questions, framing problems, and the one on marginal churn contribution. It's really interesting.
Lenny (44:42):
Amazing. Both guests of this podcast and people I love. Great choices. Vijay, this was awesome. Thank you so much for joining me. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about what you're up to? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
Vijay Iyengar (44:57):
I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. I think my handles will be in the show notes. Not super active there, but I definitely check DMs and would love to connect on either of those. And then how can listeners be useful to me? Yeah, I mean, ultimately at Mixpanel, we're building a product for product teams. So, two things. If you haven't used Mixpanel in the last four years, we've changed a lot, as I've described on the pod, so check it out, and happy to take any feedback to help us improve the product.
Lenny (45:23):
Awesome, Vijay, thank you so much.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:07):
I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things. What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:22):
Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc? You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
I'm curious what you found most impedes people's career growth.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:37):
How you view change, whether you are focusing on things you control, and third is how you see yourself. The moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Vikrama Dhiman. Vikrama heads all things product at Gojek, including product management, design, program management, research and insights with teams across India, Singapore and Indonesia. He has previously worked at companies like Directi, Airtel, MakeMyTrip and WizIQ and is among the most well-known product leaders in Asia. When I asked people who their favorite product leader is in Asia, Vikrama's name has come up almost more than anyone else's. We chat about how to move into product management, how to be a great product manager, how product managers often shoot themselves in the foot, and so much more.

(00:03:56):
Vikrama, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:00):
Thank you for inviting me, Lenny. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:03):
So as you know and hopefully as listeners know, I'm on this quest to meet the most insightful product leaders from all over the world and your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia. And you're also the third guest from Gojek, so there's definitely something in the water over there and I want to talk about that. To just dive right in, you have a very strong reputation for building incredibly strong product talent and also design talent, and also helping people transition from other roles into product management, which a lot of people listening to this podcast dream to do. So I'm going to ask a bunch of questions around this area. How does that sound?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:47):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
Okay. First question is just when you think back to the people that have done best in the product management role and have had a rapid career rise, what are some of the most common traits or behaviors or habits that you find in these people?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:05:05):
Over the last decade and a half, I've had the opportunity to work with some really strong product managers, learn from strong product managers, and some of them have had rapid career growth. When I was younger and I was starting off, I used to think it's all about the product. If you've got a really cool product to work on, your growth's guaranteed. And if you got really a product which no one cares about or a stream which no one cares about, then your growth is going to be slightly slower. But as I started seeing more and more product managers at their craft, I saw that working on a cool product area is not the only thing. In fact, sometimes some product managers would come back and complain that despite their product doing really well, they've not really grown.

(00:05:51):
And while some other product managers whose product didn't have the impact really grew. And as I started looking at it and as I started making notes, as I started talking to other product leaders, what I discovered was that the really strong product managers who were also growing in their careers did some things differently. And based on that, I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things, and I call it three W's. So what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? The really strong product managers are good at usually two of the three things. The ones who rise and when they are rising, they are performing well on all the three access. So if you would like, let's talk a little bit more about each one of these W's.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
Yeah, I would love to. I love that you put the word what at the top and that makes it the three W's, which is clever because I find even if the acronym is not necessary, it's really helpful to help people remember so I totally respect what you did there. So the three is what you produce, what you bring to the table and what your operating model is. Is that right?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:09):
Yes, absolute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
Okay, cool. Yeah, let's talk about these.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:11):
So what you produce, a lot of people index on the impact while and they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy. While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on.

(00:08:14):
And when you start figuring out which outcomes are necessary, that is when you move to the leadership and directional areas. The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:20):
So highlighting one insight here is that a lot of advice you hear about how to do well in your career, which you pointed out at the beginning here, is it's not just not immediately drive impact. That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:09:51):
Absolutely. So outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:54):
The way I think about what you're describing, which I actually 100% agree with, is when you're starting out in your careers, execution is where you need to deliver. People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:25):
Absolutely. So focus on outputs at the start of your careers and don't forget outputs even when you grow in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
So along those lines, just to close the thread on this idea, it's still helpful if you work on something that does have impact that matters, right? How important is that? And you said that you've seen successful product managers work on things that aren't as impactful and still do really well, but I guess would your advice be tried [inaudible 00:11:52] be in a place that is going to drive more impact versus it's not actually that important in the early career?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:58):
So I'll give you my example. In one of my previous roles, there were two product areas that were important for the organization. My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
I love that. Yeah, basically when you're just starting out, just execute well, execute smoothly, ship things on time. I'm going to say a few things, but I'm curious what else comes to mind here of just what does good output look like? Is it do things that are helpful to your team and manager, ship things on time, bug-free, have a clean road map, everyone's aligned behind, [inaudible 00:13:11] deadlines, things like that. I guess what else along those lines should people be like, "Okay, here's what I should be doing to have good outputs?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:13:16):
Some of the things that I think are useful. So first, what's output? Output is something which is very tangibly defined, which doesn't take too much of your time, effort, and energy to visualize and think and strategize over and you are able to quickly get moving on. Go and ask your product leader, go and ask other leaders on what are the areas they are blocked on. Sometimes they will be blocked on, "Hey, I need to prepare this brief for this particular summit", "I need to prepare this particular slide for a leadership review", "I need to prepare a review, I need to prepare a review which has to be done with the legal." You can volunteer and definitely own and deliver the first drafts of those even if the final draft is not something that you own. That's a simple example of an output, which I feel a lot of people miss because they want to be focusing on the bigger strategic pieces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
It's basically be useful. That's the way I always like to talk about this, just like your job as a PM is be useful, make your team more effective, help your company be more successful. Just find ways to be useful to everyone around you.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:14:27):
Absolutely. And be useful in doing the small things which make an impact and also contribute to your learning versus being useful in areas which you think the mini CEO should be working on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Right. There's all this talk about being an empowered product manager, building empowered product teams. I think there's an important nuance. When you're just starting out, you haven't earned the right to inform strategy and vision people. Why would people follow you at this point? We just need to get stuff done, so that comes over time.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:01):
Absolutely. And it's not just when you are starting off or when you are young. Even with if you are senior and you're starting off with a new team, even if you're starting with a new company, you need to have that mindset. And sometimes you will not know the best. And we'll talk more about how to, what is your operating model, which is how you work with others. It's a very, very important thing for you to know that you are one part of the cog wheel, you're not the entire wheel yourself. And a lot of the folklore around product managers can make you confused, especially when you're starting off in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:40):
I love it. Okay, let's keep going. Number two.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:43):
Number two is what you bring to the table. Now, I think how I describe that is what is your impact on impact? So the first access is impact, but you also need to have an impact on impact. And this is what I had missed a lot in my early career, that you put the coolest product areas, your product area is successful and that automatically guarantees your growth. It doesn't. You have to also show that yes, you were a useful contributor to having that particular impact. The simplest thing on this is that is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? Are you making sure that you are deriving from the strategy that has been shaped or you're constantly just pushing back on the strategy? Similarly, you also how you are drafting the north stars, how you are working on the experiments, how you're working on the data, how you're working on the metrics.

(00:16:43):
All these things take time, effort, and energy. And I know there is some literature and there are some operating models where people are working only at strategy levels while all of these execution of these artifacts is being done by some other people. I don't think, especially when you are starting off, that's a very, very good thing. Even when you are mid-senior, I don't think that's a very, very good thing. You have to have to be able to produce these artifacts which are product artifacts. Even if there are people in strategy creating their artifacts, even if design is coming up with a design brief, you need to have a cohesive product strategy or product PRD and work backwards from PRD and product knows yourself. These things are important to show you are progressing on four pillars, which is data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy.

(00:17:41):
Product managers constantly are evaluated on this when you interview, but you also have to demonstrate these on the jobs. And the best way to demonstrate these is through the artifacts, through the notes that you are sending. So you must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on. For a lot of product managers, when I ask, "Hey, I was working on this very impactful area. I'm not able to have the impact on my career, what is missing?" And when I go and ask, "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems?" Usually, you'll find something or the other missing.

(00:18:31):
In cases that those are bad, you will find that the pre-iteration planning, pre-sprint plannings are not running properly. You will find that the Jira storyboards are very empty and there's just a title in the subject and nothing gets described and so on. So you'll miss all these pieces. So these are the things which you bring to the table and it's very, very important that you work on these aspects as well. Finally, we have what's your operating model, which I feel is the most important thing which you have to have to focus if you are going from mid-senior to senior level. This is essentially about communication, collaboration, organizational skills and community skills.

(00:19:16):
And across product managers, again, because of the folklore of mini CEO and others, I see that a lot of people get carried away in the way they operate as product managers with other stakeholders. There are three tenets that I define in working well as a product manager with others. Number one is raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with. Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself. And finally, you are in charge of getting the decisions made and not making all the decisions yourself. I think as long as you follow these three tenets, you will have a successful relationship across stakeholders. These three tenets are easy to say, but they become very, very hard to embody and display on a day-to-day basis. But this is essentially going to be your struggle no matter at what level of product management you are operating at in your career or within your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
First of all, can you just repeat them? Because I think this is... Essentially, it's like a mantra that PMs can think back to of, "Am I doing these things?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:20:36):
So the three things which are very important for product managers to work with others and other stakeholders are raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with, bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself, and be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
I like this list a lot. It reminds me, there's this product leader I worked with who their team got pushed to do a bunch of stupid stuff. And he realized later that, "Hey, it's actually my job to have pushed back on doing this stuff." He was the head of product for this business unit and he realized, "Oh, I see. That's actually what I should be doing now that I'm in this role." And you sometimes forget that one, you have that influence. And two, that's something you should be doing.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:21:33):
Absolutely, absolutely. It's always within your control and it's always the things that are within your control that you should be controlling rather than focusing on the things that are not within your control and obsessing about those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I'm so aligned with the way you think about all these things. Coming back to the second actually, just to give people something they can do with this trait. So the way I think about what you described, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting it, is there's a detail-oriented-ness, high quality-ness to the way that you should be crafting all the documents/artifacts you're creating, your one-pagers/PRDs, your roadmaps, your strategy docs, just like they should be really high quality. So along those lines, if you're an ICPM trying to get better at this stuff, how have you found is the best way to level up in these things? Is it working with your manager and getting feedback? Is it peers? What helps somebody get better at the quality and yeah, the quality of these documents?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:22:34):
What you bring to the table is one of the most misunderstood attributes and aspects of product management. On one end, you could get around and say, "Here is my PRD, here is my JIRA board, here are my stories, here is my pre-sprint planning or pre-iteration planning document" and go. It's not just about the spread and the width of the things that you're doing, but it's also about the depth of those things as well. Some product managers, what they bring to the table is arguments, what they bring to the table are debates, what they bring to the table are pushbacks, while others are able to channelize the questions, channelize the inputs, channelize the direction and convert that into strategic choices which can then shape discussions, which can then shape direction. Be the latter and you will rise faster in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
So you have these three buckets of what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is, the three W's. So let try to summarize and see what I missed and then we'll move on. So one is just focus on executing, getting things done that are helpful to your team, your company, your manager, and focus on just getting stuff out. Not so much in necessarily in strategy. Even when you're a manager and a leader and a VP, just like you're still responsible for producing things, not just telling people and being wise. Two, what you bring to the table, my takeaway here is produce high quality artifacts that raise the bar.

(00:24:05):
The way I think about this is as a PM, you want to have this aura of I got this. People put something on your plate, you want to feel like Lenny's got this, I'm not going to have to worry. It's going to be forgotten and I know it's going to be done well. And then the third piece is this idea of an operating model. Basically just make sure decisions are being made. It's not about you that you're pushing back on bad ideas. Is there anything else I missed before we move on?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:24:31):
No. I think the art of pushback is another important factor because if you're pushing back a lot and the way you are pushing back matters a lot as well. Just don't be someone who's seen as an obstacle and a hindrance and as someone who's just very difficult to work with, but rather see as someone who's able to actually add value to whatever your leader, your stakeholders, your product area demands and you are able to advance the product and the direction and execution forward. Once you do that, I think keeping that as the intent and ensuring that your team is getting unblocked and not getting to do work on anything which is stupid or is likely to be changed, then you've really got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:23):
Do you have any advice for how to pushback in a way, the way you describe it is not to be difficult to work with or without seeking importance? I guess is there words or phrases or approaches you found are effective for pushing back against ideas that you disagree with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:25:38):
What I've seen that people who do pushback very successfully and are still considered not difficult to work with, they are also able to bring the tempo of the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional space. I think that's such a useful skill and I sometimes am guilty of operating on a slightly emotional note, which is useful. Sometimes you need a war cry, you need a high pitch, you need execution on war footing. All that is fine, but it's only fine in some cases. In other cases, it's always very important that you're able to bring it down to the logical space so that a logical and a little more equal footing of the discussion can happen. And a lot of this is something that leaders need to ensure is happening, but product managers and product leaders who are working with executives who are able to bring this tempo down and bring it to a little more logical space will also do far better in their careers and they'll also have a lot more rapid career growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
So let's talk about the flip side of rapid career growth, which is career growth that stalls. And I'm curious what you've found most impedes people's career growth. What do PMs do that shoot themselves in the foot and slow their career? Any pitfalls do you find are important to try to watch out for?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:27:15):
I think part of it is on a lot of us in product leadership space. We've not done a very good job in defining rubrics, growth frameworks and so on. But even in places where growth frameworks exist, like three W's, what I've seen is that clean mindset shifts and changes can enable faster growth, but those mindset and changes also can hinder your growth, right? So the first thing is whether you are focusing on things you control or whether you're focusing on things that are beyond your control. Second, what's your relationship with change? And third is how you see yourself. The third is very, very powerful and we'll talk about that as well. The first is what you control. If you drew an access of what you control and what you cannot control, as you're starting your career, most of the work that you're doing is in what you control, right?

(00:28:15):
You are very obsessed with feedback, you're very obsessed with, "Okay, can I do this?" "Can I do this?" "Okay, I'll probably not do this. I'll probably do this", and so on. You're not worrying about the overall corporate strategy, you're not looking at what the competitors are doing, what is their market cap and all those things. You're focused a lot on your craft, you're focused on a lot on your output and you're focused on how you are growing. As you start becoming mid-senior, I see the conversation shifts from what can I do, how am I learning, how am I growing, to why is the organization not doing this for me? Why can that stakeholder not change this thing about themselves? Why do I not get to work on projects like this? Things which start going outside your control. And it is very, very important that you keep your focus no matter what stage of career you get into what you can control.

(00:29:16):
And again, it's easy to say that everything in universe should be in your control. It doesn't happen like that, but a large number of things that impact your career are within your control. And go back to the three W's that we spoke about, what you work on, what you produce or what do you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? And there is tons to do on data, tons to do on technology, tons to do on communication, collaboration, design and research, strategy and community. And you can spend years and years and years crafting those things. Focus on those things, growth will happen at every single stage. The second aspect of it is your relationship with change. Again, when you are younger, when you're starting off, rate of change is crazy. You are growing almost every six months. You are picking up skills and experimentation, you're picking up skills in how to analyze.

(00:30:15):
You're picking up skills in how to work with different kind of stakeholders. And since the rate of change of your skills is high, your rate of growth is also high. Again, as you start becoming mid-senior, I start seeing conversations on, "Okay, maybe I should not do that. Maybe I should not take on this product. I don't know what it means for my career. I don't know what it means for my growth" and so on. So your rate of change slows down. So it's very important that as you get to mid-senior level, you are constantly checking on what you can do to keep increasing your rate of change. And one of the simplest things that you can do is if you think you are four on data, figure out who. And you may be four on data out of five in data. Within your organization, start benchmarking yourself with the best in the industry.

(00:31:13):
You'll automatically see that your scale drops and as your scale drops, you start seeing what you need to improve and do. If you start seeing that on communication and collaboration, you're reaching four out of five within the PMR, start mapping yourself to other stakeholders in other functions. Again, your score will fall in your eyes and you will start figuring out what are the things that you can do as well. So keep your focus on rate of change and rate of growth will automatically take care of itself. Sometimes it also involves changing your team or even changing your company, but those should be the last results. There are significant things that you can do within that as well. One of the final things that I see which limits you, especially as you start growing in your career and you reach mid-senior levels is how you see yourself.

(00:32:04):
I see a lot of product... And I've been guilty of that. When I see that a lot of product managers, that's included me at some stage, doing these things, people will come back and say, "Oh, I am a very high agency PM" or, "I'm a very collaborative PM." Earlier on, I used to think that okay, I need to give this kind of work to these product managers. I need to fit them with these kind of team, these kind of work areas, these kind of opportunities. But then I started understanding these things are not just signaling, they are also anti-signaling. They are like, "Oh, I'm high agency. So it's sometimes okay if I'm little brash, if I cut corners somewhere, if I sometimes come across as a little rude to some people" and so on, right?

(00:32:55):
Similarly, if I'm seen as a hyper-collaborative person, so it's okay if sometimes I'm not very decisive, if I'm not moving fast and so on because I'm this kind of a PM. So it's very important that you check for what are the stories that you're telling yourself because those stories are defining you at a basic level, which is then very hard to correct through frameworks and structures. So figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well, and then correct those stories. And the moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
Wow, there's so much meat and wisdom in what you just shared. I want to go in so many different directions. Maybe just to follow on this last thread, did you go through something like that yourself where you have this sense of yourself that hindered you? Okay, awesome. You're nodding your head, if you're not on YouTube. Can you share that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:33:57):
Yeah. So I'll give an example of when I joined Gojek. The very first thing that I learned in my career was SQL and Oracle. And I was very proud of the fact that my data skills are awesome and I know several frameworks and I know several tools and so on. And when I joined Gojek and I saw one of your guests, Crystal, and I saw the work that she was doing and her team was doing and I just immediately was like, "Yeah, no, this is not... I'm nowhere near", right? And similarly, I also thought that my communication skills are really good and my product strategy skills are very good, but then I worked with people like Dito and people like Sidu who was so good at their craft that it challenged me to see that okay, what is it that I am missing? What is it that I am doing wrong?

(00:34:57):
And it auto-calibrated me in my eyes on where it was, but that also created a hunger in me that this is what I need to fix. And I immediately corrected my assessment of myself that I'm not the strongest product manager on data. I'm not the one who knows all the strategy pieces or even strategy frameworks or how to bring everything to a strategy point of view or communicate it from an effective perspective. And then I started framing I'm still in a learning phase. When I see that I'm not in that phase now, I try and make myself humble by interacting with people who are far smarter than me on different scale or reading different books, or watching podcasts like yourselves. And that keeps you grounded on the fact that okay, you are always learning. And I also found that seeing yourself as someone who's a learner is an enabling story to tell yourself, okay?

(00:35:58):
It may not be the most exciting story, it may not be the most memorable story about yourself, but it is definitely one of the enabling stories as well. Similarly, I think one other thing that I used to say about myself was more that I'm very high agency PM. But as I started working more in Southeast Asia, I learned that mindfulness is also very, very important, that not every team, not every culture will work with you in a very hyper aggressive style. But you still need to get the work done. And I'm still learning on that and therefore, I've started using a word, I don't want to be a high agency person, I want to be a mindful agency person. And so these terms are very important because these are the stories that you keep telling yourself and these also then start shaping your behavior. I do feel that I have a lot to do, I have a lot to learn on these skills, but these things definitely keep you grounded and you keep coming back to the learning phase again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:09):
It's interesting that when you saw Crystal being incredibly good at working with data, you just realized, "Hey, maybe I'm actually not very good at this." And your reaction wasn't, "God damn it, I'm really screwed and this is really depressing me", it's, "No, instead I'm going to try to get better at this." And that reminds me some of the feedback I get with this podcast, those people are like, "Man, these people are so good, I'm never going to be this good. It discourages me from thinking I will ever be super successful in this career." Clearly, you have a different approach. Do you have advice or guidance to folks that are sometimes discouraged seeing people being so incredible and helping them actually continue to level up in this rate of change you talked about versus just like, "Nope, I'm never going to be that good?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:37:54):
I think as product managers it becomes difficult because a lot of your growth is being determined because of feedback of others. And because product management is so ambiguous and still not defined, the stakeholders can also give feedback on variety of dimensions. Some of them may not even be important enough to give feedback on, but they are important enough for them and so therefore, they give you feedback. And therefore, you have to shape that feedback in. But you also have to consider that there are these eight access that we spoke about, the data access, the design and research access, the technology access, the strategy access, communication access, collaboration access, organizational skills access, and the community access. You need to channelize feedback into okay, is this an area that you are targeting for growth or not?

(00:38:51):
And one of the most important things that I learned was that when I joined Gojek or even earlier, there would be so many different areas that I needed to improve on and still need to improve on. You can't improve on every single area. That's what overwhelms you. You need to pick which is the area which is the maximum leverage for you and improve on that particular aspect and then move on to the next area, then move on to the next area and so on. Obviously, if you are floundering in something, if you're really negative in something, then you fix that first because that will give you the highest leverage. But if you are picking up data and design and strategy and technology all at the same time, that's when you'll overwhelm you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:33):
So to summarize the advice there is one, be actually very open to feedback you're getting. It's easy to say that, it's hard to actually listen to people criticizing you and act on it. So I think that's an important takeaway here is just actually, feedback is a gift and actually understand that and try to act on it. I have a great interview with Jules Walter who's a PM at Google now, and he has this awesome quote about how whenever people give him hard feedback, it's like internally he's just melting, but that's externally he's like, "Thank you so much for that feedback, I really appreciate it. It's very valuable."

(00:40:10):
And so that's a good way to get people to keep giving feedback. Okay. And then the other piece of advice you just shared there is pick a focus area. Like say you're getting all this feedback, your strategy isn't amazing, your PRDs aren't great, just find one thing to focus on. And I don't know, do you try to do somewhat quarter? Somewhat year? Do you have a heuristic of how long to spend on one thing?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:40:31):
So different skills take different time and how you are progressing also depends a lot as well. For skills which are softer in nature like communication and collaboration and community, those are skills that you will work on all your life. You'll never achieve anywhere near two or five on five on those ever. There'll always be something that you will miss, there will always be a new context, there'll always be a new set of stakeholders, new company cultures that you have to adapt to. For others, you have to see that what gives you the maximum leverage in your career. When you're starting off, my recommendation is that you pick between data and tech one, and definitely one on design and research and strategy.

(00:41:18):
So usually, that's the combo that I recommend. My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years. Once you've demonstrated on two of these three, between data, tech and design and research, then you start focusing on strategy. We've had great success at Gojek in transitioning a lot of product managers, especially in Indonesia, using this framework. And it's produced a lot of good product managers for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
Well, let's actually follow that thread. That's really interesting. And so the approach is you have this access of skillsets and you pick, for this person moving from say customer service to product, here's the two things you need to focus on. Can you talk more about that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:42:15):
Yeah. For instance, we recently had two PMs, one who came from a growth background. This is actually [inaudible 00:42:24]'s team. And one from a research background. And with both of them, we use very different tactics. So we gave one of finding driver redesign, which was very much a very design-focused product, but we still had them leverage their data skills because we were able to create a PRD with incredible amount of data on exactly what different segments of customers we're doing. And that then we worked with designers on what the designs and the framework for that will be. And even now, Lenny, if you will come and see our finding driver redesign next time you are in Asia, it's a piece of art. And if you would see that that was worked on by a product manager who actually came from a growth and data background, that makes it even more special.

(00:43:13):
Similarly, the PM who transitioned from research, I kept giving feedback on technology and data skills are the ones that we need to check. And I need to hear from engineers that yes, they're able to work with her very strongly. And once she was able to do that, she's recently turned a very heated question on one of the features that we were doing into a full-blown solution with designs, with trade-offs and everything, and able to now convert it into a question for leadership on how we should be approaching this particular product and direction. So I think that's proven successful as well. Similarly, there's another person who took risk who was originally from research and again, worked a lot on our products, including our enterprise product. And she's doing an amazing job as well. Again, going through that path of okay, these are the things that you need to leverage.

(00:44:14):
The only watch-out is that it doesn't work out always. In some cases, some PMs will pick these things up fast, and it also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills. But it's definitely doable if you get a very strong product leader working with you who's able to shape those skills for you. So it's sometimes okay to go a little slow when you're transitioning so that you're able to go faster later rather than getting faster somewhere and then being stuck there for a while.

(00:46:29):
Something that you mentioned earlier that I wanted to come back to is this confusion about what the PM role is and how that trips people up in being successful in the role and continuing to thrive in the role. You mentioned this to me offline too, that this is just something you deal with a lot, just this frustration of what the hell is this job? What am I actually responsible for? What am I not? What do you find is helpful in helping people work through that, get past that, not make that a big blocker in their career, not knowing exactly what the PM role is?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:46:56):
I think we've been in technology product for several decades now, but we are still figuring out what an exact definition of product management is. And even the strongest definitions are slightly principled and philosophical in nature, they're not very concrete, and that also means that every and different technology companies have gone through different journeys and they've defined the roles very, very differently. And even within a very large company, you will see that different teams, different divisions are approaching the roles very, very differently as well.

(00:47:34):
And on top of that, what that does is that not only internally the product managers are figuring this out, their managers, their leaders are figuring these things out for them, but the other stakeholders who have to work with these product managers are also confused and they don't know what to expect. And the number one question I get from stakeholders is, is a product manager expected to do this? Because they also don't know, okay, is this expected from a product manager or not? And my general answer to that is, if this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Love that.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:48:09):
But that works if the product managers have had some training and they have had some training in working with different stakeholders and they have had something on the job. What I've figured out is that there are certain functions and there are certain disciplines which you can't define, but you can only become better at with practice. For instance, what is an actor or what is a dancer? Right? So these are things that you will get better at as you become skilled at it. And earlier, these things used to be looked at as something which is very artistic, only the people who are talented or only specific kind of people can do it. But now, each one of those has become [inaudible 00:48:57] and frameworks as well. So there are courses on filmmaking, there are courses on acting, there are courses on dancing and so on. And similarly, product management is that space as well.

(00:49:08):
So you have to understand there's an art to it and there's a science to it, but you can use the science to figure out the art. So that's the philosophical side of it. The second side of it is what we spoke about earlier that instead of figuring out what is product management, figure out what's your contribution, what's your output and figure out are you contributing on these access on data, on design, on technology and on strategy. And one of my favorite things is that if you created these four circles of strategy, of technology, of design and of data, and you created a product management circle which encircles each one of these, so you are the only discipline, which is the co-collaborator for all of these disciplines and tying all these things out.

(00:49:59):
So it's not about you standing alone, it's you always collaborating and pairing with someone else. But you are the only one who's pairing with everyone else and therefore, you have that unique insight which no one else in the team will have. That role can be played by someone else, it doesn't necessarily need to be called a product manager. But if you are being called a product manager, you figure out the [inaudible 00:50:24] the time piece that you are. And when you are added to the team, you must dream the team's overall contribution, overall energy and overall output up and not down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that. Something I always tell people is the PM doesn't necessarily have the magical skills other team members don't have, it's that they don't also have another job. Engineers may do a great job at being the PM, they just also have to build and code. And they don't have time to do all the things that a PM has to do, and a designer is in the same way, a researcher or data person. And so oftentimes, that's just like there's this person that has the time to do all these glue, work things between teams. And the great PMs also are very good at these skills that help you do these things, but it doesn't mean other people can't do them.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:51:19):
You see yourself as playing a role and not your title and not your function, and that just clarifies a lot of things for people. And different people will play different roles. And depending on the kind of a PM you are, are you in a specific domain or you are slightly generalist, the role that you will be playing in different teams can be different and the variety of roles that you can play makes you a better product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
I love that. You've mentioned these four access attributes of great product managers, overall product managers. Let's just spend a little time here. So you say basically the things you need to be doing and good at, data, design/research technology, strategy, and then you also mentioned collaboration and communication. Maybe you're-

Vikrama Dhiman (00:52:08):
Yeah, organizational skills and community. I think those are very, very important because one of the things and one of the things which one of the product managers works with me continues to say, and I really plus on that a lot, is that product manager is the all community enabler in the team, in the organization. And that community is the software aspect which ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output. And that I think is a very, very important goal in today's context, especially for teams which are becoming more remote or teams where people are not co-located or they're distributed. That community aspect becomes a very, very important part that product managers need to focus on and bring and channelize as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):
So let's just quickly describe each of these attributes. I imagine people might be thinking, "Okay, what should I get better at as a PM?" And this is an awesome list. Each company has their own career ladders and attributes and things like that, but not a lot of companies don't. So I think for people that are trying to figure out where do I need to get better, I think this is a really cool list. Can you just maybe just a sentence explanation of each of these attributes and skillsets that a PM needs?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:31):
So each one of those skills, like the most growth ladders, what they will do, is they will have say for data, they will have level one, exhibits these traits. Level two, exhibits this trait. Level three, exhibits this trait. Level four and level five and so on. That's how they'll describe it. But five is absolute ninja level data quality, like you could probably do a data startup of your own.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:55):
Like Crystal basically?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:57):
Crystal. And level zero is someone who cannot even basically define the basic metrics for this particular product and won't be able to figure out is this particular thing impacting orders or users or revenue. And so you'll really not be able to figure even that piece out. Similarly, on design and research, for product managers, we focus a lot more on problems and are you able to identify problems from a user's perspective. That's at level zero. And level five will be somebody who's able to define the user problems but is also able to tie them to business roles as well. So that makes it the holistic. Similarly, on technology, it's one of the skills which is relatively easier to define where you don't have any tech understanding. If somebody asked you what is HTTP or API or internet and you'll be like, "Okay, I don't know what it is."

(00:54:55):
And while on the other end, you are able to have deep debates and could probably write technology design documents yourself as well. I think sometimes people get confused between data science. And in different organizations, I see data science bucketed either in data or in technology. Either is fine as long as you are clear on what your organization's framework is. Similarly then, there is strategy. Strategy is I think another area in product management which gets very confusing because there is obviously corporate strategy, there is business strategy, there's pricing strategy, there's strategy everywhere. Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece.

(00:55:47):
So you are not in charge of okay, are you focused on growth? Are you focused on revenue? Are you focused on profitability? That's someone's choice. Are you going to pick this country? Are you going to pick that country? But once that is picked, what are the user segments that you're going to focus on? What are the needs of those user segments? How are we going to figure out what the right product for them will be? What is the order in which we are going to work on that? That whole piece of product strategy is with the product managers. And again, in the first case, you are basically going to rely on everyone to tell you, do this, do this, do this. In second and in the level five cases, you are able to articulate a very coherent product strategy at a broad level as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
Amazing, thanks for sharing that. I think for people that are trying to craft career ladder for product managers, this could help inform the way they think about this. By the way, when we mentioned Crystal, for folks that have no idea who we're talking about, she was a early head of growth at Gojek back in the day. She was a previous guest on the podcast. I always forget how to pronounce her last name exactly, but I think it's Widjaja, Crystal Widjaja.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:56:33):
Widjaja.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
Widjaja? Okay, okay. Great. Going in a different direction, we're going to move to contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you believe that other people wouldn't agree with or generally just don't believe?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:57:12):
I used to think intent is the most important thing, right? And when I was starting off, that used to be the advice that as long as your intent is right, even if some of your words are not landing, even if some of the comms are not landing, that will work out. What I've seen is that it's not enough. Your actions, your behavior, and the way you communicate, the way you collaborate, that also has to communicate and show who you are as well. So intent is not enough. And that's a thing which I think a lot of people in my age group just don't get, but people who are slightly starting off their career, it resonates well with them. Second thing I think where I feel that it's become, I don't know, is it contrarian or it's become politically incorrect, is that you still need to put in the effort and our number of hours is effort.

(00:58:23):
And I think that's one thing which has become very politically incorrect to say over the years when I was younger, it was the norm that yes, you will have to put in the effort, you will have to put in the hours to grow and improve your skills. And it's not even about your growth in the company, it's just your own growth. You have to spend the time, effort, and energy into growing. I think a lot of that is getting lost in the debates between complete workaholism and just being not very serious about your growth at all. So I think those are the two that I find myself having to explain myself again and again and why I feel this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
I completely agree with that. I find a hugely strong correlation between hours you put into the work you do and success. And I think there's been a return to okay, working hard is really important and you shouldn't be afraid of promoting working really hard. So we've actually gone through everything that I wanted to ask you. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:59:41):
No, I think it has been great talking to. I hope it was useful to people. I've tried to keep it real, but also in takeaway format. And if there are any questions that you have that I feel I have not answered, I'm happy to answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:01):
Okay, amazing. Well, we'll have people post in the comments if there's anything else they would love to ask you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:19):
The first book is a book which I feel is not quoted enough in product management community, is a book called Small Data by Martin Lindstrom. This is a person who was an advertiser or marketeer who would go and make campaigns for big brands in different countries, and so would have usually very short time to get the pulse of that space and design a campaign around it. And how he got insights very quickly from, and what are some of the takeaways that are there for people working in product space, not just product managers, but designers, researchers, strategy people, anyone really, I can't recommend that book more. And I've cited that book a lot internally.

(01:01:09):
The second book that I recommend is Adam Grant's Originals. I think it's a very important book. It changed a lot of things. When I spoke about that I was going through this crisis of, oh, I'm behind so many things after joining Gojek, Originals was one book that I read which really, really helped me think about my growth and how I see myself. And anyone who is stuck or anyone who feels they are superstars, they are the innovators of the century kind of a thing, it's a book that gives you a very good reality check. And the third book that I recommend is definitely Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. I think especially the thinking slow part becomes very, very important piece as well.

(01:02:11):
And the reason why change is hard, the reason why feedback is hard is because we are used to thinking fast and we are not used to thinking slow. While if you actually think slow, you'll actually welcome change and growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):
Amazing. That book's come up a bunch actually recently on the podcast and it is always sitting under my laptop, holding up my laptop for these interviews. So I fully agree. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:02:41):
I haven't seen a lot of movies recently, I think. But while I was on the flight back from Dubai, I saw Miss Congeniality again and I really, really enjoyed it. I thought it's a very fun movie, but also had a pretty good message. I know it's probably not the movie which anyone would want to cited, but I think it's sometimes good to just watch good entertainment.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):
That's quite the contrarian pick. Yeah, nobody has cited this movie, Miss Congeniality. This is a first, but I love it. It's way out there. I would never would've expected this.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:03:27):
In terms of TV shows, I think the show that I really go back to all the time is Schitt's Creek. I think it's a show which operates at so many different levels without taking itself that seriously, and it just lands. And especially as a product manager and as a leader who obsesses a lot about diversity, I think it did a fantastic job in showing different sides of motherhood, of the LGBTQIA communities, and also teenage girls figuring themselves out as well. I think it did a fantastic job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're hiring product managers especially?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:04:13):
So it's not really one question, but what I like to do with them is to brainstorm choices on an actual product. And I'll typically pick up a product that they use most often and then I will be like, "Okay, what if this product were to do this? Then what do you think, it makes sense? Don't think it makes sense? What about this? Okay, how would it evolve in six months? What would happen in 12 months and so on?" I think it gives you a far better insight into how would it be on working with them on a real case. And you also keep... And what I like about it is that you can keep going back deeper into it and develop it together. So I typically try and pick product that I will also not have very strong opinions on so that it can become a two-way conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):
What do you actually look for in an answer that tells you, "Okay, this candidate is amazing" versus flags that are like, "Hmm, maybe not?"

Vikrama Dhiman (01:05:21):
There are some obvious check marks that are they able to first abstract out and figure out what the overall goals for the product are, who the users for that product are, what would they be focusing on right now, whether this will align with that or not. And then a reason backwards that okay, maybe this may not work, but something on these lines. Are you obsessed about this feature or are you obsessed about okay, what this enables you to do? So if this is what it enables you to do, then are you okay with considering some other options and so on? So I think that's the direction which usually goes in the right way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:04):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:06:08):
So the reason why I've not watched a lot of drama or TV recently is because I've discovered these short video apps through Instagram and all of these apps, they dub Chinese TV serials into English or there will be subtitles in English and they are delivered in TikTok style two-minute videos. And it's a masterstroke in how the series are constructed. The first few episodes, which is like 10 episodes which is about 10 to 15 minutes, sets up the story in such a way that you have to unlock the next 10.

(01:06:47):
And these videos are quite expensive. They end up, one series takes more than the entire cost of monthly cost of Netflix to view. But it's just amazing how the whole product has been put, how all these products have been put together on unlocking the lamification aspects of it, the storytelling aspects of it, the content cutting part of it, and even the selection of the stories part of it. And what I'm told is that once I've learned about it, I've also been reading about it, they're actually companies which are able to give you tools of where you can construct this app yourself. And multiple people, two-people, three-people companies are churning these out and earning a lot of profit from it as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
What is this called for people that want to check this out?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:07:43):
So you can start with DramaBox, you can start with [inaudible 01:07:47] Reels and so on. And there are multiple of these. And those of you who are very familiar with TikTok, you would've seen that some of these show you the first 10 episodes on TikTok and then they take you to their app to view the rest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
Wow. I love so many unusual contrarian pieces of advice here, I love it. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:08:15):
For me, the most important thing has been that I started my career very late in tech. I was already 25. For the first several years, I worked in a small [inaudible 01:08:32] town in India. I came to Delhi only in 2013, and I joined Gojek in 2018. I think I've done reasonably well for myself. And it's never late to do or what do you want to do and what do you want to be. I think that's the thing that I really, really believe in and I also advise in. Especially as the world is aging and a lot of people are thinking about it, I would say that it's not too late ever. You can be and do what you want right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
So good. It's not too late. I really, really like that advice. My wife is an illustrator designer. She has a book she put out called Am I Overthinking This? It's in my background somewhere there. And she has a chart that communicates that exact message in a really cute way, and we'll try to link to it in the show notes. Final question. You live in Singapore, I know you travel a lot. But if someone were to come to Singapore, is there a food that you think they need to try that's unique to Singapore?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:09:45):
Singapore? There are multiple. So Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures. There are four official languages. And the only thing I will advise is depending on your taste buds, whatever you want to do, you should go and visit a Hawker Center. And it's an amazing experience in itself. And those of you who've seen Crazy Rich Asians, the first thing they do when they land in Singapore is go to the Hawker Center. So it's an experience of its kind. And if you are looking for a specific recommendation, go to Lau Pa Sat. If you are a fan of Indian, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Malay cuisine, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Singaporean Chinese, you'll get that. So you pick what works for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that. Vikrama, I feel like we've produced both a lot of output and we're going to have really great outcomes from our conversation. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow-up on any of the stuff we talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:10:53):
Thank you, Lenny. It's been great talking to you as well. Hopefully, this turns out well. You can reach out to me either on LinkedIn, Vikrama Dhiman, or you can reach out on Twitter. Twitter works better. And the listeners can be useful to me by, well, just sharing whatever they feel. And I continuously follow a lot of people, a lot of people who are not yet famous. Just tell me what your story is, just tell me what you are working on. And as long as you are passionate about it, I will try and find time. Maybe I cannot talk to everyone, but I'll definitely try and find to chat with you and listen out and support or connect you to someone who can help support you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
That's a very generous offer, I think a lot of people are going to take you up on that. Vikrama, thank you so much for being here.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:11:51):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:53):

## Transcript

Will Larson (00:00:00):
I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work." Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. And so actually one of the, I think, highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this kind of baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Today, my guest is Will Larson, one of the most requested guests I've had on this podcast. Will is currently CTO at Carta. He's been a software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm. He's the author of two essential books for all engineers, An Elegant Puzzle and Staff Engineer, and he's releasing his newest book The Engineering Executive's Primer in February of next year. He also publishes regularly on his blog at lethain.com, which is a must read for every engineer and eng leader.

(00:01:05):
In our conversation, Will shares advice on developing your engineering strategy and strategy in general, how to improve the relationship between an eng manager and a PM, how he finds time to write, while also working an intense full-time job, how he recommends approaching measuring engineering productivity, how to develop your company values, an amazing story about his time at Digg and so much more. Will is such a gem of a human and leader and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Will Larson after a short word from our sponsor.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by DX, a platform for measuring and improving developer productivity. DX is designed by the researchers behind frameworks such as Dora, Space and DevEx. If you've tried measuring developer productivity, you know that there are a lot of basic metrics out there and a lot of ways to do this wrong. And getting that full view of productivity is still really hard. DX tackles this problem by combining qualitative and quantitative insights, giving you full clarity into how your developers are doing.

(00:02:07):
DX is used by both startups and Fortune 500 companies, including companies like Twilio, Amplitude, eBay, Brex, Toast, Pfizer, and Proctor and Gamble. To learn more about DX and get a demo of their product, visit their website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

(00:02:28):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing it. Another date conversion edge-case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences.

(00:03:02):
From embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error online 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:03:36):
Will, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Will Larson (00:03:40):
Thank you so much. Super, super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:42):
So many people have suggested that I bring you on this podcast. You have a lot of fans out there and I am excited to be digging into engineering topics, which we don't do enough of on this podcast. So thank you for making time for this.

Will Larson (00:03:54):
No, thanks. I hope to be a good early engineering guest before you pivot entirely to engineering at some point in the future.

Lenny (00:04:04):
Wow, I love that. How cool would that be? I was an engineer actually when I started my career. How interesting would that be if we come full circle? Anyway, I thought it'd be fun to start with just what is changing in engineering? It feels like there's been a lot that has changed over the past few years, especially from kind of the ZIRP zero interest rate era to today's market, which is very different. What have you seen most change from an engineer's perspective and then just also what are you telling eng leaders about how to handle all this change?

Will Larson (00:04:32):
I think it's a pretty strange time in the market. So I think that I started working and right before the 2008 kind of crash. And so the first two years there were not so good. When I joined Yahoo, there was a layoff basically every four months. There was a layoff of some sort. It's pretty chaotic. But then we got into the last decade and it was just smooth. So numbers went up, revenue went up, headcount went up and people started learning how to build really large teams.

(00:05:02):
People started learning how to hire a lot. When I was at Uber, some days I would do six interviews back to back. I would just be in a conference room and at some point you can't even remember who you're talking to because you talk to so many people, one after another after another. You just have some scrambled notes you're trying to decode afterwards.

(00:05:20):
Pretty different now. A lot of engineering managers are spending half their time or more hiring 18 months ago and now they're doing two interviews a month or less. Maybe zero interviews a month. So there's a real shift in just the amount of time people are putting into hiring. Instead, all these different competencies that have become more critical or a really great engineering director might've just been spending their time hiring really well and that could be a top performer and now that person can't actually demonstrate what they're great at.

(00:05:51):
So that person might be perceived as a low performer if they're not also figuring out how to lead the team, getting deeper into the details and also sometimes getting into the figuring out what is the right allocation, what is the right sizing of the engineering teams, this is stuff that we weren't talking about much or maybe if you really pissed off the CEO, maybe an infrastructure you just grew a little bit slower next year, but different ballgame at this point where teams are actually disappearing, teams are getting cut down, teams are getting consolidated. And that's just something that we've avoided for that ZIRP era that now we become a core part of a lot of the job.

Lenny (00:06:27):
It feels like also engineers... They used to have a lot of leverage over companies, inside companies. I imagine that's also changing in a big way.

Will Larson (00:06:37):
I think that's true. I think this actually has been bad for engineers in some way. One of my hobby horses is that I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, "Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work."

(00:06:53):
Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. Actually one of the, I think ,highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this baseline assumption of like, "Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems." And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well. That's a highlight for me and the shift recently.

Lenny (00:07:18):
I have definitely worked with that and experienced that where you don't want to piss off engineers. And so are you saying that because that's changing, leaders maybe don't have to worry as much about upsetting engineers plus you just generally think we shouldn't treat engineers that way?

Will Larson (00:07:33):
Yeah, I think a little bit of both, but I think there's been, in this previous era, where hiring and retention were one of the biggest ways you evaluated middle management. Losing team members was huge, huge issue. And so you started to coddle a little bit, which is actually bad, again, bad for the engineers, bad for the teams, bad for everyone, bad for efficiency of the organization. But now something that I love is we get to give engineers real hard problems and we get to actually hold them accountable. And that means we can put them in senior roles.

(00:08:07):
One of the things that I've been pushing on, I wrote my last book, Staff Engineer about what is the career path for senior engineers. One of the challenges is if we aren't comfortable holding engineers accountable because we just want to retain all the engineers, then we can't put them in senior roles. And so I think we're actually seeing a bit of a shift where we can actually hold them accountable, which means we can put them in senior roles, which means the engineers can actually get what they've been trying to get the entire time, but we haven't been able to because we've been coddling them a little bit too much.

Lenny (00:08:33):
Okay. So there's a few directions I want to go and I'm just going to poke around and see where we go. The first is you're a big advocate of systems thinking. We were chatting about this before. I think a lot of people have heard this term systems thinking and there's books about it. It's sounds great. I want to be a systems thinker. What does that actually mean? How do you find you apply it in your work? How do people get better at this way of thinking?

Will Larson (00:08:57):
A lot of the least successful but smartest people I've worked with were really strong systems thinking advocates. And so I do want to say every kind of framework has a lot of downsides. There's no framework that people can apply consistently, universally, and get good results. And so briefly on this one, what I see is often people will find a spot where their system and reality are in conflict and they'll be like, "Reality is wrong." And so what's a concrete example?

(00:09:28):
At Stripe, we worked on incident management. And so Stripe pretty important company where our API is available. If the API is down, you lose money and if you lose a lot of money, you leave Stripe because you're pretty upset about that. The number one thing businesses need to do is to collect money successfully for the service that they're selling, right? Stripe is super important.

(00:09:49):
And so we did a lot of analysis on incidents trying to understand why things weren't working, what we could do better, but we got so caught up in the analysis that we lost track of whether we're actually improving things. And it took us a while to figure that out because we were so stuck in the systems thinking model and it's not like, "Oh, the team was wrong." It's like, "I was wrong." I was caught up in that model myself, to realize like, "Hey, we weren't actually prioritizing improvements, we were just prioritizing measurement." And you can't keep measuring. There's measure twice, cut once. Sure, but you don't measure infinite times and never get to cut.

(00:10:25):
And you do have to cut at some point to actually make impact. But we just got caught a little bit there. I think a lot of people who get too far in systems thinking make the same mistake where they think reality is wrong and reality is never wrong. Reality is always right. Your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality. But that conflict, that gap is really interesting and that's where you can learn.

(00:10:49):
And so I had this model. It's really clean. It represents your hiring pipeline that moving through different steps. It represents your incidents and how you remediate incidents. It can model almost anything pretty quickly when you get good at it. And then understanding how reality is in conflict with that, you start to understand where your mental model is wrong and then you can go educate yourself and improve the model and just keep doing that.

(00:11:12):
At some point the model is close enough and you can stop doing that and go actually do the work. So that the biggest thing I tell people is this is a great way to learn, but you also have to do things. You can't just learn. That's not our entire job.

Lenny (00:11:25):
To make it a little more concrete, how would you best describe this idea of systems thinking? What's a good way to just like, "Okay. I get what you're talking about?"

Will Larson (00:11:32):
This is probably a better place to start versus a rambling anecdote about using it.

Lenny (00:11:38):
We can go backwards. It'll be great.

Will Larson (00:11:41):
Systems thinking is basically you try to think about stocks and flows. So stocks are things that accumulate and flows are kind of the movement from a stock to another thing. So what's a simple example of a stock? A stock could be the number of fish in a lake. A stock could be the number of people fishing in a lake. And so a flow between those two could be the number of fish in a lake will decrease at some rate based on the number of people fishing in that lake.

(00:12:08):
So if there's a ton of fishers, the stock of fish will go down faster. There's only a couple of fish, IT will go down slower. But also then there's these flows which kind of dictate that where if we've got much more efficient fishermen, the flow of fish out might go down, but also the fish do reproduce. So then there's another flow going back. So based on the current number of fish and the reproduction rate, the current number of fishers and their fishing rate, you start to see how these can evolve over time. And a lot of this.

(00:12:38):
So first always recommend Thinking In Systems by Donella Meadows. Really phenomenal book. And a lot of her work is also kind of referencing the work in Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, which talks about how small amount of carcinogens or something low in the ecosystem or the food chain rather as they get consumed by predators further and further up get concentrated. And that's a kind of a classic systems thinking problem to think about where you wouldn't think a small amount of carcinogens and a small fish actually matter. But as they go up the food chain, they start to concentrate it and an unexpected change can happen.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So then going back to your example of the hiring pipeline, let's come back to that to help connect this definition, which I've never heard, which is awesome, very clear to how you actually implemented say in hiring.

Will Larson (00:13:23):
The first thing to do is to get a model out there of any sort. And so you think about your stocks. And so in a hiring pipeline you might have potential candidates and this could be basically infinite, and then you have a couple of inflows. So you could have sourced, you could have outreach, you could have referrals, and then you have the candidates and those... How many people get sourced. There's probably a function of number of sources you have dedicated to a role. So you'd have another stock of how many sources you have and then that would impact the rate going from potential candidates to actual candidates you've sourced.

(00:13:59):
And then from candidates that you have in that box, you'd have a conversion rate for people who pass the first recruiter screen and that would move into step two of your process. And then from step two you have maybe a hiring manager screen and that would be another conversion rate. So you can see over time how the candidates of the infinite potential candidates like wandering around LinkedIn, posting about their deep thoughts, convert into actual people, your first, your second, your third.

(00:14:26):
But then as you get deeper into it, you start to actually see interesting things. And so for a lot of candidate or a lot of pipelines, the biggest issue is hiring managers don't want to extend any offers because the hiring managers can't get to confidence on any candidate. And you'll see in this pipeline, you'll see a ton of candidates getting to offer stage, but almost none of them converting from a potential offer to actually offer. And then you can say, "Hey, here's the problem. You need to go work with the recruiter and the hiring managers on getting conviction about who they should hire.

(00:14:56):
Classic problem with early managers, right? Here's a second problem. Manager wants to extend a ton of offers. They do extend them and none of them actually accept. And so that focuses you on the second problem. But there's a third potential world where actually you're just not getting enough candidates in. You're actually doing a great job of making decisions, great job of closing candidates. There's just not enough candidates coming in. And so by looking at this and you can build this model, then you can go to your applicant tracking system, a greenhouse or whatever and pull the historicals and you can just see how the historicals work versus how you'd expect it to work.

(00:15:32):
You can see the drop-offs and this helps you figure out where should you go try to fix things first. I think we've all worked in companies where you roll out big changes with no data behind them because like, "Oh, it feels like we're not hard enough in how we evaluate candidates or something." You go change a bunch of stuff. But often the real problem might be that the hiring managers making offer extensions to people who never passed the loop anyway. It's just the managers are issuing too many offers because they're panicking. And man, less true now, but a decade... Or not a decade, two years ago, hiring managers panicking to get offers out, that was a real thing that happened a lot. And this just helps you take a complex kind of abstract problem and turn it into something you can actually work in a systematic way.

Lenny (00:16:17):
I feel like product managers will either naturally do it things this way already because a lot of them think in funnels. And it's interesting to hear this version of it of this idea of just following the stock through the flow of the different steps. Awesome. Another thing that I know that you are very passionate about and spend a lot of time thinking about is engineering strategy. I think you have this kind of feeling like engineers don't think enough about the end strategy. Every other function has a strategy and engineers often don't. Talk about what you find there and what your advice is around that.

Will Larson (00:16:52):
First, I start to question whether any function has a strategy at most companies. My general experience is that there's very rarely a written strategy for any company. Sometimes it's a value statement. It's like we build the highest quality products and you're like, "Good. Okay. What do I do with that?" You're like, "Build a high quality product." You're like, "Okay. I don't don't know what that means."

(00:17:15):
Engineering often has this problem where I think people will make comments in their culture amp or their quarterly surveys or whatever. It's like, "Hey, the strategy is not clear or where's the engineering strategy?" And the biggest thing I tell people when they complain and then engineers complain about the product strategy. The PMs don't have any strategy or the business has no strategy. And the reality is product eng and business always have a strategy. It's just often not written down.

(00:17:45):
And so the first thing I want to do is I push people not to get caught up on the fact that there's no template out there, which is product strategy that someone has forked and filled in. It doesn't mean you don't have a strategy. You do have a strategy. It's maybe a little bit hard to articulate and maybe it's applied inconsistently across different layers of the product reporting chain because it's not written down. But it's never true that there's no product strategy. There's always a product strategy. Sometimes it's bad, but there's always one. And true for engineering as well. There's always an engineering strategy. Just sometimes it's bad.

(00:18:21):
The first rule of strategy is that if you write it down, then you can improve it. If it's not written down, it's hard to say if this PM is just not a good PM or if they're trying to apply the strategy that they've misunderstood or if they actually are correctly applying the strategy from the head of product that's just not appropriate to the problems they're working on, how do you debug any of that?

(00:18:43):
If you have a written document, even if it's not a super compelling strategy, at least you can start debugging. It's like, "Hey, the head of product should improve the clarity of this document. Hey, this DM actually isn't applying it correctly. Hey, the strategy actually isn't appropriate for this one business unit where it makes sense for the others."

(00:19:02):
So that's the first thing I think about. But the second big theme on strategy I think about is that often good strategy is so boring. It's hard to talk about. For example, on the engineering side of thing, a common strategy that's really good but very boring is we only use the tools we have today. So a lot of times you'll get engineers that want to introduce new programming languages, new databases, new cloud providers. And a really good strategy for almost all companies is like we just use the standard kit we already have today.

(00:19:39):
And at Carta, when I joined one of the engineers, Eric Vogel wrote the standard kit and that is our strategy of the tools we use. And you know what? Some people are really frustrated by that and I feel for them. It feels like they're losing control, but the power of these boring strategies is that it focuses people's energy on the problems that we value as a company. And so it is painful coming into alignment if you're kind of slightly misaligned over time, but boring strategies that tell you what actually matters and aligns you with what the company actually caress about are really good for you even if they're a little bit annoying at a time. And I can expand on this idea a lot, but I won't ramble indefinitely on it.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Well, maybe what might be helpful is what are some other examples of engineering strategies that you've seen just to give people even more just like, "Oh yeah, maybe this should be part of our strategy."

Will Larson (00:20:31):
So first, what is a definition of strategy? And the best one I've ever seen is from Richard Rumelt. He wrote Good Strategy, Bad Strategy.

Lenny (00:20:40):
He's coming on the podcast.

Will Larson (00:20:42):
Amazing. He also wrote, The Crux I think came out this year sometime, which I also read. I think both great and just a phenomenal thinker who has so much depth. I think one of the challenges of writing about strategy is you're like, I've seen two things and I write the book, but I think the thing that's impressive about Richard Rumelt is he's seen so many different scenarios that he's able to really operate from both the particular but also the general and dataset in a really interesting way. Another book with similar characteristics is How Big Things Get Done by... I forget the authors, but really amazing dataset of how mega projects kind of succeed and fail.

(00:21:21):
But anyway, Richard Rumelt, definition of strategy is basically three components. There's a diagnosis. What is the current status quo? What are the things that are real today? There are guiding policies which are basically based on the diagnoses, how do you want to address them? And there's actions. And actions are how are we going to implement these guiding policies. He talks a lot about actions because concerned about this idea of inert strategy where you have like, "We're going to deprecate our old product features we don't use, but no one deprecates any of them."

(00:21:52):
So he's really concerned about this non implementation kind of useless strategy that doesn't do anything. On engineering, I'm a little bit less worried about that. I think strategy is more interesting on engineering in terms of clarifying how we make future decisions. And so what are a few examples of that? At Uber, we only used our own data centers. We didn't use the cloud. And this has changed since the era I was there, but in the 2014 era, no cloud, and we had a strict no cloud policy. And this was annoying because we had to indent everything ourselves or run copies of everything ourselves.

(00:22:28):
But it also meant that we were able to spin up in China in literally three months and some surreal stories from that. We couldn't fit our racks into the data centers, so they had to take the roof off the data center and lift the racks in with the crane.

Lenny (00:22:43):
Holy shit.

Will Larson (00:22:43):
Just tons of stories and all this had done in three months and truly phenomenal. And Uber wasn't in China for very long, so in some ways you're like, we did all that just a leave? But they left with a nice stake of Didi Kuaidi and not a bad outcome overall. But I think that strategy, we run everything in data centers. We don't use the cloud, meant we were able to move in and out of different geopolitical constraints and companies that relied on cloud presence simply can't. There are fully constrained by where AWS or Google Cloud or Azure have built out. So that's one good example.

(00:23:21):
Another good example at Stripe was this idea of we run a Ruby monolith and that's what we did and that's evolved a bit since then. There's more Java and the Stripe of 2023 than there was in the stripe of 2016 or the 2012 or whatnot. But that policy really focused the engineers on building innovative features for our users rather than building different tooling to support different programming languages. And so in both cases, both the Uber policy around running our own data centers and the Stripe policy around Ruby monoliths, a lot of engineers hated these.

(00:24:02):
But the goal of good strategy is not to appease everyone. The goal of good strategy is to dictate how we invest the limited capacities we have or the limited capabilities we have into the problems we care about. And I think both of them were really effective towards that end.

Lenny (00:24:17):
A common theme across all these examples is essentially constraint, deciding we will constrain our options to move faster and focus on the things that really matter.

Will Larson (00:24:28):
In solving the constraints is to me, I think the most interesting thing that strategy really does, and I think when we talk about bad strategy usually is because the diagnosis is bad and it's usually because people are exerting what they want to be true on constraints where it's like, "Hey, we can do all of these projects at once." And often that's just not true, but it's hard to convince people that when they're the CEO or they are really committed to believing it, but almost all bad strategies basically come down from a willful disbelief of what an accurate diagnosis is, which means then your guiding policies are kind of incoherent to begin with.

Lenny (00:25:08):
Awesome. I'm excited for that episode of Richard where we're going to go real deep into strategy, but maybe just as a lasting topic around there, if someone listening wanted to get better at say end strategy specifically or a strategy in general, is there anything you recommend they do? Is it read these books? Is there anything else?

Will Larson (00:25:26):
If people want to get good at strategy, there's a lot of different types of strategy, but here are some things I'd really recommend. First, I think the Richard Rumelt book, I think Good Strategy, Bad Strategy is probably the right starting point. I think The Crux also quite good, but maybe I would read that one second. Great overview of how to think about strategy. Also Thinking in Systems, I mentioned that before related to systems thinking, a big part of strategy is being able to model the reality so we can improve your diagnosis.

(00:25:56):
So I think that one is really quite good as well. If you get into the engineering side of things, there's a lot of interesting books here. There's Technology Strategy Patterns by Evan Hewitt. There's The Value Flywheel effect by Anderson, McCann and O'Reilly. The Phoenix Project by Kim, Behr, Spafford, which is a modern rewrite of The Goal by Goldratt. But I think there's still the missing canonical book is kind of missing on this one. So I took a stab at strategy and my upcoming book, which is coming out the Engineering Executives Primer coming out early next year.

(00:26:33):
Also, took a stab at it. In staff engineer my previous book, but I still think there's a missing book here. So I am dreaming of writing an engineering strategy book for my next project, although we'll see if that actually comes together.

Lenny (00:26:48):
Well, let's actually follow that thread of writing something I was definitely hoping to chat about. You write a lot. You've written two, three, four-ish. You're writing a new book. How many books you've published? Two books and there's a third one coming up.

Will Larson (00:27:00):
So I have two books. First one with Stripe Press, the second one, self-published and the third one with the Riley coming out in two months effectively.

Lenny (00:27:08):
Okay. And then also many, many blog posts for many, many years. I asked a few people what to ask you, and this came up a lot, Gergely Orosz and Alex Xu from ‎ByteByteGo both asked just this question of just, "How do you make time to write as much as you do?" And then I also, I'll ask this too and just answer it either first or second, just what impact has writing had on your career? Why do you keep doing it?

Will Larson (00:27:37):
I feel really strongly that you can write a lot more if you write what you want to write. And so this is one of the reasons I don't write for financial gain and I don't write very much on a schedule, so I've done a few pieces for magazines, et cetera, but I find that actually really draining to be you have a topic, you have to agree on the topic. If a topic starts missing what you want to write about, you can't fix it a lot of the time and you're also on this deadline. You're like, "Ah, I'm screwing up. I need to ship this. It needs to be done tomorrow."

(00:28:12):
I just find that really draining. Conversely, when I own the schedule, when I get to write about, "Hey, I'm writing out something." So I started writing this infrastructure engineering book a couple of years ago. It just wasn't there. I just couldn't get it to come together and so I just stopped. I'm not writing it anymore. Maybe I'll come back to it at some point, but probably not.

(00:28:34):
To me, the biggest strength of writing what you want is you get to write where there's energy and you don't have to write where there's no energy, which takes you really, really negative. And this also ties into how I write books, which is that I basically write the entire thing before I start working with a publisher. And if you are, I think diligent and good at anticipating what their concerns are going to be, you can mostly reuse the content that you're trying to write. This is also easier in the sorts of books I write.

(00:29:05):
I think harder to do in a really technical introduction to MySQL or something, you can't just resequence those chapters and pretend it's going to work. Those chapters build in a different way than the sort of business book that I write does. Writing the stuff that's energizing and just giving up on the stuff that's not energizing, that's how I write a lot and how I've been writing for 16 some years. And the way I keep doing it is just by writing what's energizing and what I'm thinking about now.

(00:29:38):
I don't write what I'm not thinking about and I don't write for any audience, I just write what is interesting to me. And that means some people don't like it and that's great. That's totally fine. It's not really for them, it's for people who want to follow the ride and that's where I focus.

Lenny (00:29:57):

(00:30:55):
Okay. There's a lot more I want to dig into here. How many posts have you written do you think over the 16 years?

Will Larson (00:31:00):
I would guess about a thousand. That would roughly be my assumption. I think there are a few years where I wrote hundreds of posts, and so if you do that like three years, it's not that hard to get to a thousand from there.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's incredible, especially because you've had intense jobs for all of those years or most of those years. Very high pressure, fast growing hypergrowth companies. Somehow you find time to work. So first, let me just double click slash co-sign your advice here around paying attention to what gives you energy and working on things that you're actually curious about. This is exactly the advice I give to people. A lot of people start this full-time writer, creator life, and they're like, "What do people want? What do people want me to write about? What's popular? What's going to inspire go viral?"

(00:31:48):
And that's easy to do a couple times, but then you end up creating this job for yourself that you don't want. You don't want to be spending all your days writing about AI if you're not that excited by AI or whatever's hot these days. What I find is important is almost like 80, 90% of what you write has to be stuff you're excited about. And then maybe there's a bit of, "Here's what I know people really want. Here's what I know is going to do really well." Because otherwise you just burn out. You create a job for yourself that you don't want. Why would you do that?

Will Larson (00:32:13):
Yeah. I just a hundred percent agree with that. I think the other thing is that everyone converges on the same thing that they think people want. So it's crypto two years ago. It's like AI right now or it's counter AI. AI is going to ruin the world. It's hard to say something very novel because, one, everyone is trying to say something about it. Two, it's almost certainly not what you're that knowledgeable about where if you just stick in your lane, I think the biggest risk to writers is quitting.

(00:32:43):
A little bit like the 40-year career idea. The biggest risk to content creation of any sort is quitting soon because you get burned out. The biggest risk is not that you grow too slow initially. There's always this sense that you've missed the wave. It's too late to join Substack. The top writers are already there. You'll never be a top writer. It's too late to podcast. There's too many podcasts. You'll never make it. It's too late to join Medium. You'll never make it. There's too many Medium writers.

(00:33:11):
But it is just not true. If you just keep writing good stuff, you'll build an audience over time and you can take that audience from platform to platform. What really matters is finding something you can actually keep doing for the next decade. That's way harder than doing it for one year.

Lenny (00:33:25):
We have the same exact advice on this. This is exactly the things I tell everyone. When I joined Substack, I thought it was too late. I was like, "Man, it's over." And when I started this podcast like, "Oh man, there's a billion podcasts. How is it ever going to work?" So I so agree, and I also so agree on the fact that this whole thing is such a... It's a long game. There's a lot of people. I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it up. Nobody actually keeps it up because people are going to come and go. The thing that really separates success from failure is just people that can keep at it. There's not an end game to this. It's an infinite game and it's about being able to sustain that over the long term.

Will Larson (00:34:04):
You're not competing with other content creators. If you think of it as an infinite game, you're all working together. You can all help each other grow. There's no maximum number of product writers or thinkers who can be doing something. You're not less successful because [inaudible 00:34:22] exists or something like that. There's no competition there. It's like a false, false dichotomy.

Lenny (00:34:27):
Yeah. I totally agree with that. Unless there's so many and then all of a sudden what happens is the bar just gets higher, which is good because then people get better stuff and that's fine. That's happening anyway. Just the bar continues to increase because there's more and more content out there. And to me that's the ultimate thing you got to get right is just the bar. You just got to be at a high bar for anyone to care about anything you're writing about. And to your point, to do that well, you have to actually be excited about writing about it and have background and have something to contribute.

(00:34:59):
I'm just ranting here, but the way I think about this is you need to add something new to the conversation for anyone to pay attention because there's so much fluffy, superficial stuff. And to get anyone to care is you need to say something new that no one's heard before or share new information they haven't seen anywhere else.

Will Larson (00:35:15):
I totally agree. I could keep ranting about this for the entire time. I don't want to derail on this, but I totally agree.

Lenny (00:35:23):
We'll control ourselves. So then getting very tactical, I think this is what a lot of people are always wondering, how do you make time? What's your workflow? How do you make time for writing so that you keep at it with knowing you have an intense full-time job?

Will Larson (00:35:34):
I used to do things differently before I had a kid, so I have a three and a half year old and just timing your life just really shifts a lot once you have kids. But the biggest thing that I found is finding things to write about that also directly relate to what I'm working on. And this is where I can do something that helps me at work and helps me write at the same time because I think it's incredibly hard to find time to write about stuff that has nothing to do with your work.

(00:36:05):
And this distracts you from your work because these... Particularly if you're in a senior role, these can be pretty demanding jobs, but they're not demanding because you're responding to an urgent DM on Slack every five or six minutes. They're demanding because you need to make some really difficult decisions really well. And I think writing about related topics is a great way to refine your thinking and improve your performance. It's not like a conflict or you do one.

(00:36:34):
You either write or you do your job well. I think you can find a way to align. And so a lot of podcast folks do interviews with folks who are related to what they're thinking about at work, and that's a great way for them to learn, build their network, to refine their thinking, to test their thinking against experts in the field. It's not like in conflict with the work, it's in alignment. So that's one piece. But yeah, I've played around with my schedule a lot.

(00:36:58):
Before I had a kid, often Saturdays would be the writing day and so morning and early afternoon would just be writing. I can't do that anymore, so now I mostly write at night, which is tricky from an energy management perspective. But the biggest thing I would say is just if you're actually excited about something, you will find time and energy for it. If you're not excited about it and it's 9:00 PM, you're just going to get asleep. And so I really think that this is where you have to schedule a little bit deliberately, but the first thing we talked about around energy management, they really come together. When your schedule gets tight, if you're not energized, you just won't get it done. And why would you? It just doesn't make sense.

Lenny (00:37:41):
Just to close out this thread for someone that wants to do more writing knows that it's going to be valuable, but just hasn't any one tip that you would leave them with to get on this train?

Will Larson (00:37:51):
It depends why people want to write. I tell people, if you just want to write something that is going to help advance your career, you should really focus on writing two or three really good things and spend a ton of time drafting, revising, getting feedback. You just focus on making one great artifact or two or three great artifacts. You don't need to create a long-running blog where you publish every week. There's really no need to do that if your goal is just to create some artifacts that show you're a deep thinker, that help position you in the industry.

(00:38:21):
Don't start a newsletter if you just want to advance yourself in the industry a little bit. Just write two or three really good things. So that's the first thing I'd say. But if your goal is to write a lot consistently over time, my biggest advice would be just publish. And so there's a lot of people out there with stuff that hundreds of drafts and they've not published anything. And my thing is I publish almost everything I write. If there's something that I'm not going to publish, I don't start writing it because I have a quick check in my head like is this something I can write and publish?

(00:38:56):
And if my answer was like, "No, I just don't even start." And my accuracy has gotten higher over time as I've written more, but I published pretty much everything I write. That's why some of it is not that good. And that's okay. Again, I want to write. I want to get these ideas out. I want to show what I'm focused on and my evolution as a thinker trying to learn how to operate in these different roles in these different companies. I'm not writing trying to create a polished perfect thing, and also I'm not writing to maximize a reader's experience of reading it.

(00:39:27):
Some people don't like that, and I think that's a totally reasonable thing not to, but I think what I can bring you is my experience as an operator who's actively learning and thinking through. I think that's really valuable to other operators in the industry. In terms of giving you the perfect writing, I try to do that, closer to that. I don't know if I ever hit perfect writing, but that's where my books are. The books are taking a collection of thoughts over a couple of years, cleaning them up a little bit, packaging them. They're way higher quality than my typical writing.

(00:39:56):
But yeah, I would just publish a lot. Don't worry about the quality. Sometimes people will send you silly feedback and I just don't respond to that stuff anymore. You never know why people send you something like that. I think trying to debug people you don't know is a bad use of time. It's just kind of like, "Thank you. Move on to the next. Don't even spend time worrying about it."

Lenny (00:40:19):
I like that term debug people. I think people way overestimate how much anyone cares about what you put out. Most people are going to look at it for three seconds and be like, "Eh." That's the worst case scenario basically is just like, "I don't care about this." Not like, "Oh, Will is such a fool." What a dumb thing to say. Right? No one has time for that.

Will Larson (00:40:38):
And if they do, that's a them problem, right? The internet is a big place with a lot of people and there are people who are going to be having a really bad day when they encounter something you do and they're going to channel that anger at you or that frustration at you, but that's not about you. That's just like you happen to be there when they engage with it. You don't have to take that on. That's not your situation. It's okay.

Lenny (00:41:03):
Also, when you're just starting out, that's going to be the least stressful time to write because nobody knows it or sees it, so that's when it's like "Take all the crazy... Just do stuff." It only gets more stressful as you build an audience over time.

Will Larson (00:41:15):
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely true.

Lenny (00:41:18):
Okay. Shifting topics. There's a lot of product managers that listen to this. Something PMs often wonder is how to have better relationships with their engineers, their eng managers. What advice could you give to product managers to build more productive happy relationships with their engineers and eng managers?

Will Larson (00:41:37):
So the core problem, and most of the EM PM peers that I've worked on... There's two core problems. So one, sometimes the incentives are misaligned and that's hard to navigate, but if you can just be honest with each other and understand the incentives, sometimes you can find a compromise, but sometimes the EMs and PMs will be misaligned because just their incentives are so far apart that there's no way to get to the bottom of it. And so this might be timeline related or saying yes to sales related. Or the engineer is like, "Hey, we definitely can't say yes to that." And the PMs are like, "Actually, we're going to say yes to it because really important for me getting promoted," or something like that.

(00:42:19):
Is it ever this simple? It's really never that simple. People create simplistic narratives to find villains that they work with. There are no villains in the workplace. They're just people with complex incentives that are doing complex things. But sometimes I talk to EMs who think, "Oh, the product manager is just saying yes because they want to get promoted because the salesperson will review their promotion or something."

(00:42:40):
The reality is never as simple. The reality is the business needs to sell stuff to remain functioning. You can't just say no and have the business succeed. That doesn't work either. So one, understanding the incentives. The other piece though, and I think this is the more common case or just that the EM or the PM just don't understand the other person's needs and they start arguing before understanding. So my biggest advice to both the EMs and the PMs, is before you try to solve the conflict, it's like pushing to ship this feature, pushing to change the approach. Just make sure you actually understand what they care about.

(00:43:17):
There is this idea that you have to make trade-offs and that there are tons of hard trade-offs to be made in the field, but my experience is if you really deeply understand what everyone wants, there's usually a compromised solution that gives everyone exactly what they want. That doesn't take more time. You just have to be willing to dig deeper into it and understand the true needs for each party, which is often not what they're saying by the way, which is part of the confusion.

Lenny (00:43:45):
On the incentives piece, is there anything you've seen work to fix that problem? Because if PM performance reviews are based on impact engineering, performance reviews are based on interesting projects or uptime, do you just work to change those ladder definitions? What actually can help that situation?

Will Larson (00:44:05):
So my biggest thing has been trying to force this idea that EM/PM pairs are peers and they generally have the same performance rating. And there's exceptions here. It could be the EM is clearly not performing and then it's not the PM's fault if the EM is can't show up to work. The team doesn't respect them. Sometimes there's clear non-performance, but generally hard situations are not situations where one person is obviously terrible. Those are easy to diagnose, those are the easy ones. But in cases where there's two folks who seem to be pretty good, but just the overall execution is not working out, I think this idea that same perf rating for both drives a level of one pain, but the right perspective.

(00:44:56):
Also, something that I think Carta has experimented a little bit with over time. Henry, our CEO has a blog post about trifectas in doing that, but not just for EM and for PM, but also for that business leadership as well where you all get graded the same score based on your ability to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just your functional constraints.

Lenny (00:45:20):
Wow. That's so interesting. So your recommendation, something you're doing, it sounds like is the engineer manager and the PM get the same performance review rating? And so they're discussed in the same meeting.

Will Larson (00:45:33):
Our chief product officer, Vrushali and I spend a fair amount of time calibrating together and making sure... Again, there's cases where there's an exception because there's clear issues happening for someone. But on average that is what's happening. And I think people know that's what's happening because we told them that. And I think that's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:45:55):
That is so interesting. I've never heard of that approach. That is definitely solving that problem of EM/PM or...

Will Larson (00:46:01):
Yeah, the incentives are shared now, which isn't perfect. It's still hard to balance them. They can still make the wrong trade-offs, but at least they understand the incentives are shared, which I think is a pretty powerful idea.

Lenny (00:46:15):
That is really interesting. I imagine some companies might even want to include design managers in that, take another step.

Will Larson (00:46:23):
The role and the primacy of different functions in different companies varies so much that it's hard to have a one size. You could also imagine where you want a staff engineer in that or not. And so I think very company specific. But yeah, I think design could absolutely be involved particularly for a design led company like an Airbnb or something like that.

Lenny (00:46:43):
Wow. So interesting. Maybe just as a final thought there, if a PM is having challenges with their EM, what do you think PMs maybe don't realize their engineering managers are finding important or maybe are stressed about that they're just like, "Oh wow, I never thought about that."

Will Larson (00:47:00):
I think one of the biggest challenges I've historically seen, particularly in the last decade is this idea that engineering managers have the job of giving their team interesting work. I think that that can put... You often see this in growth teams where the growth team is like, "Hey, we just need to do a ton of experiments." An engineer is like, "I want to build something brand new." And the eng managers in between those try to figure out, "Need to ship 50 experiments that are pretty boring and they want to do something brand new. I don't know how to do solve this."

(00:47:30):
So it's a tricky moment. And good EMs find the way to balance, but that's the biggest source of ongoing friction where the EMs have been told by their teams they need to do something that the PMs just have no visibility into. And it makes the EM seem totally unreliable partners because they're trying to solve these little bit of these invisible constraints. And that's where I think pushing further to understand, "Hey, you keep prioritizing this rewrite into a new programming language."

(00:48:00):
To me that seems like completely idiotic thing to be doing. What's going on? And then once you understand, you might not agree with them, but at least you can have an honest conversation about how to navigate those constraints versus just like, "Man, you won't believe what my EM partner did today. This bozo did blah, blah, blah." And having this victim villain mindset about your peers.

Lenny (00:48:24):
An adjacent topic that I wanted to spend some time on is measuring engineering velocity productivity. I think it's probably one of the most common and also maybe the most annoying questions eng leaders get is just how do I know if my engineers are moving as quickly as they can? How do we help them move faster? What advice do you give to eng leaders for eng teams just for how to measure productivity well?

Will Larson (00:48:44):
This is a question that's coming up even more in a moment when we're reducing a lot of the size of teams from the industry when the venture capitalists that are on the board for these venture-backed companies are pushing on the efficiency of engineering. Engineers are trying to figure out how do we represent this? How do we prove that we're appropriately productive for the amount of headcount and funding that we have as an organization?

(00:49:09):
And man, that's hard. So the first way that people focus on trying to answer these questions is just benchmarking by the amount of funding that you have. And that's pretty straightforward to do is a mechanical exercise. You get a data set from your venture capital funds or whatnot, and you figure out, "Okay. How much should we be spending in R&D? How much should we be spending in engineering? How much should we be sending on infrastructure engineering in R&D?" And you can benchmark this all out and figure out what the correct numbers are there.

(00:49:40):
The problem is this is a very mechanical and not very insightful, driven way. It'll get you a defensible answer. It's like the old, no one gets fired for buying IBM, which definitely hasn't been true in my career ever. But this idea that if you just have the right benchmarks, DCs won't judge you for spending too much in engineering, but this doesn't actually help you get to the right place. It just helps you get your board to be less angry at you, which is useful because it's hard to do good work when your board is angry at you.

(00:50:13):
But it's not useful in the sense that it doesn't actually help you run your organization effectively. So then there's the much harder mediator problem of how do you actually know if your R&D team or engineering team is effective? What I find is a couple of things. First, if you're a good leader and you talk to engineers, they will tell you... The engineers know if their teams are effective or not. And if they're not, they'll also tell you why not. And their diagnosis can be wrong, but there's a crumb you can start picking up and you can trace the crumbs to figure out what's wrong.

(00:50:49):
Often you'll have more experience to analyze the complaints to figure out what kind of the contributing causes are to them. But yeah, if you just go talk to the team on an ongoing basis, you'll know if they're effective or not and you can go work to solve those specific problems. But again, you can't tell your board, "Oh, it's fine. I talked to the teams that they're good." My intuition's spot on because how do they know if your intuition is good or not?

(00:51:17):
They're dealing with a huge portfolio and some of their leaders are talking to are good, and some of them have terrible intuition. How do they actually assess? I think it's tricky. What I've tried to do is basically two things. One, aligning engineering evaluation to the business and product goals. So I want us to be wholly accountable with the product goals. Well, we did a good job products like screwing up over there. Obviously, a lot of companies find comfort in doing that, but really we're here to support the product, to support our customers in doing something interesting. We're not here to build novel systems unless it supports the customer and the product.

(00:51:59):
So first try to align heavily there. Second, I think just showing the roadmap of the valuable things we've done in the last six months is really powerful. I think sometimes people are like, "I don't have anything to put there." And you're like, "Yeah, that's a real issue." Or if you have the ton of stuff to put there, that's great. I really find that if you just commit, show the number of meaningful, meaty things that have impact that you're doing and you can explain the impact, people will step back and give you space. If you can't populate that list, people will have concerns and rightly so, they should be concerned about that.

Lenny (00:52:36):
Is there any metrics or tools or anything like that that you find useful too? Because these are all awesome piece of advice, but I imagine everyone is always just like, "Give us this number we're tracking, give us this dashboard, see what engineers doing."

Will Larson (00:52:49):
So one of the most influential books in the last decade in software engineering leadership and infrastructure is Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and I believe there's a third author on that one, but I'm forgetting right now. Really phenomenal book and it comes up with these four metrics. It comes up with lead time. It comes up with incident remediation time. It comes up with failure rate. And the fourth one of some sort. There's at least 50 different startups out there that are selling you dashboards that instrument these pieces of data and they want you to just evaluate your team on them.

(00:53:30):
The challenge is these are really good diagnosis metrics. And so hey, our deployments are slow. Why is that? How do we speed them up? But your deployments being slow doesn't make you a good company or a bad company, it just tells you where you should focus on improving. It doesn't actually change how you are. And similarly, if your lead time is quick or slow, it tells you where you should invest or it doesn't actually tell you if you should fire your engineers or something like that. That's way, way more details specific.

(00:54:00):
So people do like to see these metrics just like they see uptime metrics. A lot of engineers report on sprint points or stuff like that to their board, which are just totally, totally fake thing to be reporting on. But people get some comfort on it. So my biggest thing here is when people measure things, this isn't an engineering only problem, but when people measure, they take on the perspective of an expert and they can tell you why not to measure everything. They can tell you why every measure is wrong or inaccurate and they rule everything out and so they measure nothing and they go to someone who's not an expert and well actually there's no accurate measure to give.

(00:54:37):
They're not an expert is like you don't know what you're doing. And so you just have to get comfortable measuring something that's not perfect, but you can actually measure and reporting on it and then the measure that's imperfect as people ask questions, that's an opportunity to educate people on why the measure is imperfect. What are some things that misses or kind of the lies from the conversation.

(00:54:59):
Metrics are about educating the people consuming the metrics about the reality of the rich data underneath. They're not about this perfect data set that shows everything starting with something mediocre and the Dora metrics are really helpful for diagnosis, but if you have to, they can also be a good enough starting place to start reporting to your board or your CEO or to the other executives and then you're like, "Oh, there's all these problems with them."

(00:55:22):
Yes. There are all those problems with them, but that's this place you start and you educate people up from there to help them understand the nuances and that's how they become more sophisticated, understanding engineering, not by refusing to give them anything they can possibly measure.

Lenny (00:55:36):
Awesome. I'm glad that was your answer because we had Nicole on the podcast and she talked through Dora and all the frameworks that she recommends. And she even actually shared some benchmarks that she points people to that give you some sense of just like, "Are you in a good place roughly or not?" So we'll point people to that episode to dig deeper. Awesome. I'm glad that you're a fan.

(00:55:55):
Okay. Just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. One is around values, company values, org values. Do you have some really good advice for people for how to think about coming up with values? What do you share? What do you recommend to people that are trying to figure out what values they should define for their org and their company?

Will Larson (00:56:14):
I mean, values are really interesting, right? And different companies talk about values in different ways. I once worked at a company where the execs went to visit the Facebook campus. They saw the values written up on the wall and they took the Facebook values and wrote them up in our walls and that didn't do a whole lot. It maybe undermined people's confidence in the critical thinking of the executive team that just took these written up on Facebook walls and replicated it.

(00:56:39):
But I think those values did work well for Facebook and those values were meaningful for Facebook. And so first you can't do is just steal values. Value cargo culting. Users first. Great Amazon value. A lot of companies aren't users first and that's okay, but what's not okay is when you put, "Hey, we're users first," and then you actually show the decisions you're making and you clearly aren't users first.

(00:57:06):
So one of the things I think about is just honesty. And so good values have to be honest and so any value can be honest or there's no universally honest values. You can say something like, "We're thrifty." Or we can say something like we spend as much as we need to get the best value. Those are totally different and good companies are run both ways. So the first rule I think about a lot is honesty. You actually do what you claim you do and the value. The second one is applicability. You have to have value that you can actually figure out how to apply to your work.

(00:57:39):
And so one of Stripe's values was no longer a value I believe, but it's optimized globally. And so optimized globally is a really interesting problem because sometimes you'll have something you wanted for interesting value. Sometimes you want to do something and you're like, "Hey, I want to introduce a new programming language that's better for my team." For the organization overall, this is actually much worse for the organization so I'm not going to do it.

(00:58:03):
Uber didn't have this as a written value, but implicitly Uber's value was do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else because that will slow us down. So the two different companies had opposite values, but they're both very applicable. It's like how should we navigate decisions? Should I optimize for my team or for the organization? So those are applicable to real problems and they were honest where Uber was just like, "Don't worry about other people." Make it work for your team. And that's how they moved so fast because they just didn't worry.

Lenny (00:58:32):
Wasn't their value of toe-stepping, encouraging toe-stepping, something like that?

Will Larson (00:58:36):
Let builders build toe stepping. There were a number of values that could be interpreted in different ways and sometimes they got weaponized in various ways as all values do. But these are both interesting in different ways. And so number one is honest and two is applicable. Three is I think the last thing for a good value is this idea of reversibility. So there's some values that aren't actually usable. And so here's a good example. We build good software. Okay. But why would you ever not build good software? That doesn't make sense or we solve customer problems that matter. Good.

(00:59:22):
What company doesn't think they're solving customer problems that matter? And so there's certain values that just you can't apply. And so I think of these as identity values. These are really just you describing who you want to be or we care about our customers. Great. But who would say they don't care about that? There's certain values that I think of as just identity values and they're not wrong to have identity values, they just aren't very useful.

(00:59:51):
You can't actually use them for anything. And so I just always push people not to spend too much time on these because they feel good when you're an executive team debating what are these identity values? It's like we're kind to other people or sure that sounds good. We're a family. Sure, that sounds good. That one I guess is a little bit reversible. There's Netflix, which is like, "We're a team like a sports team. We're not a family." And so a little bit reversible, but not perfectly.

(01:00:20):
But yeah, these are the three that I found really useful for any value. Is it honest? Is it applicable? And can you reverse it? And if not, it's probably actually not helping the team make decisions.

Lenny (01:00:30):
These are great. It reminds me a lot of... I was there during Airbnb's period of coming up with values. Something that I would maybe add and maybe fits into one of these buckets is it needs to be clear who doesn't? There needs to be a group that doesn't quite fit because if everyone fits, you're not doing anything useful. What's the point? Which feels weird to say, why would not everyone fit in our big group of awesome company? But it's clear who is not a good fit, who doesn't belong basically. It's kind of like a cult a little bit like, "Who's not in our cult? Who doesn't belong?"

Will Larson (01:00:59):
But I agree. If it doesn't apply to anyone, then why bother saying it? It doesn't mean anything. And you could say it's actually the hiring filter where there are people who you've explicitly chosen not to hire because this wouldn't apply to them. Then I think it's useful because it helps you actually figure out who to bring in. But if it doesn't apply to anyone you're hiring or anyone that you have in the company, then it's just isn't worth having because you already have too many values. You are already trying to get rid of values because you have 17 and you need to get down to four where people can remember them. So if it doesn't apply to anyone, why bother having it at all?

Lenny (01:01:32):
Yeah. Integrity is a common one. Integrity. Everyone has that. Nobody wouldn't want integrity. What is unique?

Will Larson (01:01:38):
We're a non-integrity company. We're the company that thinks integrity is bad. That's not a real thing.

Lenny (01:01:45):
The other one I'll add to is honest. So Airbnb, we had six values initially. One of them was simplify and a year or two later everyone just realized we're not actually good at this. We want to simplify, but we're not great at this skill and values should describe who you are not who you want to be and aspire to be. So they cut two values including that one, and they're just like, "Let's just do these four because this is actually who we are. Let's be honest with ourselves."

(01:02:11):
Okay, final question. I wanted to visit Failure Corner, something that I've added recently to this podcast where people share a story of failure. And you have this amazing post about your experience with Digg and the rewrite that you all went through. I think it was the version four of Digg. Can you just tell that story and what happened? How much of a mess it ended up being?

Will Larson (01:02:33):
Yeah, Dig V4 is... I mean, it's still something I have a lot of fond memories for. There's one picture that I've kept and there's a picture of a lot of the engineers around this table in the middle of this giant office and they're serving sushi. We had waiters, caterers come in that day. They're serving sushi. They have plates with champagne flutes on it. There was a full bar and we're all around this table because the site is not up.

(01:03:03):
And so Digg before essentially what Kevin Rose or the board or some combination there realized is that Digg was losing to the social networks and that this idea of aggregated news was going to be outcompeted by the Twitters, the Facebooks, et cetera, if we didn't find a way to move to have a social component for it. It even outcompeted by Reddit longterm was kind of the fear. Although at the time that that was far from obvious. And so we needed to move to support social functionality and the previous version we simply couldn't get it to work.

(01:03:39):
So the decision that was done, I think two and a half years before I joined, and the shift about six months after I joined was they needed to do a complete rewrite in order to get there. This is a decision that never works out for anyone. So I think as someone with more experience, I could have predicted this wasn't going to work out. But I was earlier in my career. My PM counterpart at Yahoo, Das Kofinovsky. He went to Yahoo and he's like, "Come to Digg."

(01:04:10):
Worst case you'll make a couple hundred thousand in a year. Worst case. Probably really great outcome. Anyway, that's not what happened. The worst case was a little bit optimistic. So we go and the CEO got fired two days before I joined. So the current CEO left and then Kevin Rose came back for about six months, something like that. And we're just on the death march trying to get this thing out.

(01:04:37):
So we pushed really hard. This was before the cloud for the most part. So we wiped pretty much all of our existing servers to re-image them to the new software. We try to bring the site up and just keeps crashing. And so it basically takes us a month to get it fully functional again. And so that day sitting around that table with champagne and sushi, that's just like day one. And by 30 days in, most people aren't even trying to get the site back up anymore.

(01:05:08):
There's maybe five of us who are still trying. And we did. I think that was a really powerful moment for me. I think in the first two days myself and Rich Schumacher, one of the other engineers, we had to write a caching system from scratch, which got us half the way up. Really a terrible way to do software on a side note. I'm not recommending this to anyone. This was a series of anti-patterns kludged into a launch. But we got it partially up, but we had to restart it every 12 months.

(01:05:41):
Every 12 hours, every server had to be restarted even with the caching mechanism. And then about three weeks after that, I finally figured out what the core bug was, that was bringing us down every 12 hours. It was this incredibly simple issue that had just been hard to debug, basically related to the way that Python initiates variables used as default parameters. It's something super silly and we just had someone who hadn't written Python before who was working on the API code, so they didn't realize it's gotcha.

(01:06:15):
Then no one else caught it when it was reviewed and it just took a long time to debug. It was such a non-obvious. It didn't break anything, it was just doing a lot of extra load on the servers. We finally figured it out and it was just really remarkable experience pulling through. And you know what? The company still went to zero. So we had this at launch. I think we did this heroic, heroic stretch to get it working.

(01:06:43):
A couple weeks after that, a new CEO came in, did a round of layoffs. This is back I think 2012. The team nine months after I started was down to 30 people from about a hundred and it went downhill from there, from a business perspective. But we launched a lot of functionality, has really learned just a tremendous amount. And it kind of shaped what I think about in terms of early in your career, getting learning and going into a company that is maybe having a rough time.

(01:07:15):
I became a manager two and a half years into my career. Basically running the entire engineering team there because everyone who had a lick of sense quit or got laid off, and it was just complete idiot me trying to be the manager for the engineering org, wasn't qualified and no one would've given me that job, but I was the only one dumb enough to take it at that point. I learned so much and I really the kernel that turned into my entire career where it was that opportunity, even though at the time it was pretty grim.

Lenny (01:07:49):
That's an amazing story. I feel like a lot of these experiences were in the moment, it's just like, "What is going on? This is so bad and hard," end up being the most interesting and looking back end up being the most biggest teaching experiences. The ones you like bond over with people you work with like Apple. It always comes to mind where it's just like Steve Jobs's joke, people like crazy and then they look back and that was the best moment in my career.

Will Larson (01:08:12):
You would never voluntarily take on a lot of these really challenging things, but sometimes when they show up, you're with a group of people you really respect, you love working with and you want to overcome together. And that's really powerful experience. Even if Uber China was similar where if someone had been like, "Hey, do you want to go work on this Uber China migration?" I would've been like, "Absolutely not." But no one asked. They're just like, "Get this done," and so we did. I think these things are pretty remarkable.

Lenny (01:08:39):
And just to be clear, so Digg was down for a month basically during this period? Is that...

Will Larson (01:08:43):
So it basically didn't work properly for much of the month. It was like read only was back up in about three days, but the vast majority of the actual user functionality just wasn't working properly for pretty much an entire month and it was not that good. I mean not great, but that wasn't the biggest problem Digg had at that point. But it was one of the biggest problems that had at that point and it wasn't a real sign of things likely to go well for us. But like I said, you learn from those and I'm really proud that we and the team got it working, got it running even if ultimately we still went to zero and ran out of money and kind of sold for parts.

Lenny (01:09:32):
Do you think Digg could have made it? There was a world where Digg would've been a hugely successful business or do you think it was just way too late and it's the wrong product?

Will Larson (01:09:39):
The thing that really killed Digg is the change. It wasn't SEO driven. So monetization was from ads. Well, many companies including Digg claimed that it was the first in kind of stream, in feed like advertising company where Twitter has ads within the tweets or Facebook does. But Digg did that before Facebook or Twitter really innovated the ad format. But the vast majority of monetization was on these... We call them permalink pages, which is page 40. Then article we crawled and the vast majority of traffic for that was driven by Google search. And so there was an SEO change, which really is the thing that started creating the urgency for us to launch this migration.

(01:10:20):
SEO changed, traffic started going down, monetization was driven by that. And so we were already on fire by the time we tried to launch this. But I do think that I still want something like what Digg was trying to become today. Social news based on like what my friends are actually reading and liking merged with a global index of similar users who are interested in similar topics. It's still a product that I think Google Reader has some kind of similar components to it.

(01:10:49):
These are both interesting products solving interesting problems that have not for whatever reason been successful as businesses. And I do think there's a gap there still, but there's a lot of people trying unsuccessfully to fill it and there must be a reason why people struggle to fill it despite so many people trying.

Lenny (01:11:06):
Awesome. Will, is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very fast lightning round because I know you have to run in about five minutes?

Will Larson (01:11:16):
I think we've covered a lot of it. New book coming out. New book coming out in February, Engineering Executive's Primer, O'Reilly. But that's probably it.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Awesome. Where do people find that? I know it's on O'Reilly. You can look at a preview of it even today, right?

Will Larson (01:11:29):
Yeah. O'Reilly, you can see the early copy. You can order it on Amazon as well, but it won't be shipping until February.

Lenny (01:11:37):
Okay. And then just to be clear, who's this for? It's for engineering executives by the sound of it.

Will Larson (01:11:42):
It's for engineering executives, but more so like anyone who wants to be one, anyone who's trying to figure out how to work with an engineering executive. So I think if you are struggling to understand why your CTO keeps doing boneheaded things, or if you want to side manage them, you're the head of product and you can't get the CTO to stop complaining about the engineers need more interesting projects to work on, this might be useful for you too.

Lenny (01:12:04):
Amazing. Okay. Ready for the lightning round?

Will Larson (01:12:07):
Let's do it.

Lenny (01:12:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Will Larson (01:12:11):
So I talked about Thinking in Systems and Primer. I talked about Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, but I'll give you a third one, which is Don't Think of an Elephant by George Lakoff. It's a really interesting book about framing things in conversations that has really changed how I communicate.

Lenny (01:12:24):
Amazing. Favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Will Larson (01:12:28):
I don't watch much TV or many movies anymore, but something I do still watch is Top Chef with my wife. She's a Top Chef, super fan. And there's something just very relaxing from these formulaic structured shows where you kind of know what's going to happen. There's no real consequences that matter too much and just escaping from real life to these formulas can be pretty peaceful.

Lenny (01:12:50):
No one has ever mentioned Top Chef before, so that's fun. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing for a job?

Will Larson (01:12:58):
A lot of my interviews now are trying to help people decide if they actually want to join a company. And so my favorite question I ask now is like, "Hey, we've really loved you. You're going to come through. I think you're going to get a lot of offers from other companies too. I bet you'll have three or four really compelling offers because you're a fantastic candidate. How are you going to figure out really specifically which of those options are right for you?"

(01:13:22):
I think it forces people to tell you what they want and then you tell them why you have that more than anyone else, and then you can actually pitch them on what matters versus pitching on things that don't.

Lenny (01:13:31):
Love that. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, find useful either in work or in life?

Will Larson (01:13:40):
No mottos, but I can think of two things I thought about a lot. At Uber is something I talk to people a lot because it was a challenging time for much of it. It was there's no way around, just through.And that was like, "Hey, we're not going to dodge around this. We're going to gut through it and we're going to get to the other side and then we're going to be there." What I think about a lot more now is, will anyone remember what we decided in six months? Because I think people stress out about a lot of decisions, but I increasingly believe most decisions people stress out about just aren't that important.

(01:14:11):
So I'm like, "Will anyone care in six months what we did here?" And the answer is no. Just do something reasonable and let's move on to the next more important thing.

Lenny (01:14:17):
I love that. You've done a lot of writing. Is there a piece that you've written that you feel like is underappreciated that no one really totally got and hasn't spread and you're like, "Ah, I'm so proud of that one"?

Will Larson (01:14:30):
Maybe the piece I'm most proud of from last year was Hard To Work With. So Hard To Work With is basically I see a lot of people who are incredibly talented, but they try to hold their peers to a high standard and then they're viewed as combative or difficult to work with. And this one comes from a core struggle of my early career where I kept trying. I thought I was holding people accountable and people were just like, "You suck to work with."

(01:14:58):
And I was like, "But I'm just trying to have a high standard. Isn't that what we want?" And talk about honest values. Every company is like, "We have high standards," and you're like, "Well, let's do it." And then they're like, "We don't have high standards here. You suck." So that one is one that really is so transformational to me, and I think it really hits some people hard because I think a lot of people really go their entire career without figuring this one out.

(01:15:20):
And they're some of the most talented, hardest working people you'll ever work with and can't quite land this one idea that's holding them back. And they care so much and they are often despised because they care so much. I think this is one that I hope more people will read over times and there's a really important lesson for me in there.

Lenny (01:15:42):
Well, we will link to it in the show notes and help more people discover it. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Will Larson (01:15:51):
So find me online, lethain.com, lethain.com. All my writing, my books, everything links linked there. And the biggest thing that I'm thinking about right now is just strategy. So really curious for folks who are thinking about strategy, who think they've done product, business, or engineering strategy well. Would love to hear from folks what they're thinking about, what's actually worked and maybe what are the lies that have not turned out to work that they thought might work earlier in their journey.

Lenny (01:16:19):
Amazing. Will, thank you so much for being here.

Will Larson (01:16:23):
Thank you so much. This is really fantastic.

# An inside look at how Figma builds product | Yuhki Yamashita (CPO of Figma)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:15):

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

(00:32:44):
As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma. And you can tweet at me, you can find me anywhere. And, of course, we're also hiring, so if you know great people or are interested, yeah, there's a lot of roles, so please get in touch.

Lenny (01:08:06):
Awesome. Yuhki, thank you so much for being here.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
There's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw Lenny [inaudible 01:08:35] Figma was, if this is the future of design, I'm quitting, right? I'm changing careers.

(00:00:17):
And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it equips your customers or user base with that, then I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion.

(00:00:35):
So it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working. Obviously, that's a tall order or don't want to come up with that, but hopefully, if you're a founder and you're working on something, your vision is so big that you have those kind of ideas and it's like, how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

(00:00:58):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products, interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.

(00:01:12):
Today my guest is Yuhki Yamashita. Yuhki is Chief Product Officer at Figma, where he's been for almost four years. Prior to Figma, he was at Uber, both as a Product Leader and also, interestingly, as Head of Design for one of their bigger product teams. Before Uber, Yuhki spent time at Google and Microsoft, even taught an introductory computer science course at Harvard.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, we explore Figma's product development philosophy, how they build such consistently great products, how they hire, what habit Yuhki has found to be the most instrumental in his success in his career, and also what Yuhki and his product team have learned by building a product led growth business.

(00:01:50):
This episode builds on a newsletter post where I interview Yuhki about how Figma builds product. So if you enjoy this episode, or even while you're listening to it, I highly recommend you check it out. It's currently my fourth most popular newsletter post of all time. You can find it at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Yuhki Yamashita, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:15):
This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? A's notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed.

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If you're business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked, or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

(00:03:33):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:03:55):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:28):
Yuhki, welcome to the podcast.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:04:30):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:32):
I'm quite honored to have you on this podcast. For folks who don't know, we actually collaborated already on a newsletter post that has quickly become my fourth most popular post of all time, which you can find if you search for how Figma builds product. And so I am really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that we, maybe, didn't cover in that newsletter. Also, just like how product works at Figma in more depth, how the PM team works, how you think about product, and things like that. So again, thank you for joining me.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:00):
Hi, team, as a huge fan of this podcast, so really honored to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
Wow, that means a lot. I really appreciate that. So you are currently Chief Product Officer at Figma, which is such an epic role. It's such an epic company. Could you take just, maybe, a minute or two to high level share your career arc, how you got to where you're today as CPO at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:05:22):
My first job out of college is actually at Microsoft, and I was the Product Manager on Hotmail. If anyone, any listener remembers Hotmail, and I didn't really know what product management was at the time, and I mute it as a interdisciplinary function that will give me exposure to all my other functions so that I can actually decide which function's interesting to me.

(00:05:48):
And so, spent a couple years at Microsoft. Through that, also, moved on to Hotmail to Windows. And at the time, they were working on Windows 8 and Windows 8 was really interesting because it's a very touch forward version of Windows. And so there's just a lot of conversations about UI and UX, and that was really fun for me.

(00:06:07):
And as I was thinking about what's next, I really felt the draw of Silicon Valley and I ended up at YouTube, and I believe Shishir has been on this podcast before?

Lenny (00:06:19):
[inaudible 00:06:19] you.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:06:19):
Yeah, so Shishir was leading YouTube at the time, and he continues to be a great mentor of mine, but had the opportunity to lead the YouTube app on iOS over there. And it was really funny because I had never touched the iPhone before my first day, so my manager, on my first day, just sent me to the Apple Store to buy an iPhone. But that was my next job and that was a really interesting change for me, too, of, and we can talk about this later, as well as different companies and different styles of product management and really figuring out, I think it was a place that taught me a lot about some of my product last weeks to date.

(00:06:58):
And this is also around a time where there are a lot of interesting companies that were working in the physical and digital space. And so Airbnb was one of them, Uber was another. So I felt this draw just because it seemed just a really interesting space to be in. So eventually, ended up at Uber. Uber was another company where I feel like a lot of my philosophy that, hopefully we can get into today, around how to build products, how to build products in the kind of environment that's really fast moving. And so that I learned a lot from there.

(00:07:33):
And to date, all those companies has really been focusing on the core experiences on consumer products, and that's really been most of my career. And as part of that, worked with a lot of amazing designers. But at Uber, I realized that I wanted to dip my toes into design directly. For the tail end, I actually switched from PM to design and managed a few design teams working on our bikes and scooter efforts just to understand what that's like. And it was around this time, around my Uber career, where we encountered this tool called Figma.

(00:08:08):
I'd happened to be working on a project that experimentally brought Figma into the company. It was a time in the company where we were trying to transform our culture to be much more transparent and inclusive, and Figma was the perfect fit for that. So, I got to watch how Figma changed the way it worked, how it's spread within the company. We got to know the Figma team a little bit, as well. And yeah, I was really drawn to that mission and as a product manager who's been straddling that boundary between design and products for all my career, I really loved how Figma proactively blurred that boundary and opened up that process of participating in design. So I really got behind that mission and that's how I ended up here, at Figma.

Lenny (00:08:49):
It's so fascinating that you moved into design from product, and then back into product. At Uber, were, what was the role? You were Head of Design for the mobility team?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:08:59):
Yeah, it's called New Mobility, focused on just our micro mobility efforts, basically. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:05):
Do you recommend this path for PMs to switch into design? I know it's not something anyone can do, but do you feel like that is an important skill role to experience as a PM, you encourage people to try that?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:09:16):
Well, I decided it's not for everyone, but I think that it's, first of all, a really great empathy building exercise of understanding that point of view, and also pushing yourself to push on the product from a different angle. Because I think as a PM, you're in the center facilitating all these different trade offs, and when you go into design, you have to ignore some of those other aspects to really be insistent on pushing on the best experience possible. Just suspend everyone's disbelief in business feasibility or engineering feasibility to push on a vision. And that's just an interesting exercise to do.

(00:10:00):
And then, I think the last thing is, I actually think it's an opportunity for in design and PM to learn from each other. When I became manager of design teams, one of the things that I coach designers on, are how to win over PMs, and how to speak in PM's language, and likewise, it's important for PMs to understand that, as well. So those are some of the things that I thought were helpful, but again, it has to come from a place of passion that you know you really want to do this.

Lenny (00:10:29):
Which job would you say is harder; design or product management?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:32):
They're hard for different reasons. I would say managing designers is harder than managing product managers.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Interesting.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:10:39):
And I think part of it is that designers are, it's really important to focus on growing their craft and helping them develop as designers. So it might not be that the company's biggest problem is one where you can actually learn this new thing you're trying to learn as a designer, and this probably happened for engineers, too, right? You could be working on the onboarding funnel, and that might not be the best place to be learning micro interactions, or maybe it is, but those aren't always aligned.

(00:11:10):
Whereas, with Pms, it's a little bit more like PMs are just hungry for impact, and so you can point them to the biggest problems a company has. And while PMs also do want to understand different kinds of problems or have the experience working on different kinds of problems, at the end of the day, I feel they want to be working on the thing that matters most in the company. So from that perspective, it's easy.

(00:11:31):
But as you know, and the reason this podcast exists is because PM isn't easy. And so the discipline, I think, is harder in a sense that it's sometimes hard on a day-to-day pace to know if you're doing the best thing you could possibly be doing. And so I think that makes it a little bit harder as a PM, as well.

Lenny (00:11:52):
I had a designer friend who moved into a PM role, I had a product role at a startup and she's like, "Holy shit, I had no idea how hard being a product manager was, and a product leader. I have so much more empathy for the PM role." And so, it's interesting, it works in both ways. Similarly, I was actually a manager of engineers, at one point, and I felt the same way where managing PMs was a lot easier than managing engineers. So, translates to a lot of different roles.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:19):
Yeah, I can see that.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Folks listening to your career arc and just all the places you've been, all the wonderful things you've done. Imagine many people are like, wow, how do I have a career like that? Microsoft, Google, Figma, Uber. If you had to think back and identify maybe one habit, or one skill, or behavior that you think has most contributed to your success as a leader, as a product leader, what do you think that would be?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:12:45):
People who work with me know that I often talk about storytelling and, in fact, if you've ever reported to me, storytelling has showed up in some kind of performance review, I feel, and that's how much I care about it. And I actually think that a lot of being a great product manager is being a great storyteller. And I know a lot of us have already talked about it out there. I think the importance of storytelling is understood, but maybe I would share two things that are specific about it that I think are interesting.

(00:13:13):
One is to understanding the power of synthesis and it's this idea that maybe even as a early career PM, you're inside some of these reviews and a lot of people say, "Hey, at least you could take some notes for the meeting so that you're adding value." And so that's common advice, here, but I think the most powerful part of that is that in some ways, you can synthesize what happened. And a lot of things are said in a review and there's still this bring it all together into a distillation of a message. And even that's like, that's a lot of power, I think. And what do you take away from all these different opinions that all these leaders had, and how do you push that, push the project forward from there? So that's one example.

(00:14:02):
Or another example is, I really love thinking through frameworks and offering ways of talking about a problem or ways of thinking about a problem. And that's synthesis, too, of figuring out all these different disparate parts and coming up with a way to a lens to look at something. And I feel like it's something that was, I learned, mostly through literature classes almost, where you're doing literary commentary and you're reading a William Yates poem and you're trying to, you observe all these interesting things, but then you have to take those different observations and distill it into a thesis, into something cohesive. And I think that's what a good PM can do. All these different ideas, and opinions, and problems, and how do you distill it down? And so I think that's one aspect of storytelling that's really important.

(00:14:54):
And the other aspect of storytelling, of course, is a story is only as good as the action that it's capable of driving. And a lot of times that I often coach my product managers are on, we're living in a world where everyone is constantly distracted, and you get these 30 seconds of attention at a time. And so, just the ability to really tell something powerful that sticks is really important, the memorability of it.

(00:15:21):
And I often talk about memification, which is this idea that I found this out most at Uber, I feel, where there's certain insights, data insights, research insights that were memmified to the point where someone like Travis or Dara would just cite this insight in the middle of a meeting, and you know that you've really done your job as, maybe, a researcher or a data scientist or product manager if people are able to do that and draw from that in that way. And that's what, ultimately, sticks.

(00:15:52):
And so when you start thinking about it from that perspective, it's really powerful because it's the way in which knowledge is transferred within the company and you compel action for it. Or when I'm being, maybe, asked questions by other leaders or stakeholders, the thing that's going through my head is, okay, there's this story that, that leader is trying to develop, or a meme about what this project is about or what the biggest problem is. And so, what story are they trying to create in their head so that they can remember or talk about what's happened?

(00:16:28):
And if you take that mindset, you just realize that it's a really useful way to think about everything.

Lenny (00:16:35):
I'm really excited to chat about this idea because it comes up a lot. The power of storytelling, it's similar to being good at vision. It's like PMs are always told, "Hey, you got to improve in vision." Here's a skill the great PMs are really strong at. And I feel like storytelling is similar. It's this vague cloud of a skill that you build over time. And you mentioned a few things that you recommend to people that you work with. Think of it as a meme, maybe.

(00:17:01):
Is there anything else? When you're doing a performance review with a PM and one of their skill gaps is storytelling, is there anything else you recommend they specifically do to get better at the skill, or is it just do it again and again and watch me do it, watch other people do it and you'll learn?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:17:16):
Yeah, I think of it as resetting the internal computer of my brain a little bit so that I start from scratch again. And when I'm starting from no context at all, can I build up the story from bare and explain what's happening? And oftentimes, you're just caught in the middle of everything and you have all this context that might not be obvious if you step away from it for just a second.

(00:17:39):
I guess the way to think about it is, put yourself in another user's shoes, and that user is someone who has no idea what's happening and still wants to understand, in a nuanced enough way, what you're grappling with. And so, that reset moment, and to pull yourself out helps you tell a better story, in many cases. So that's one thing that comes to mind, yeah.

Lenny (00:18:03):
Got it. So it's escape the curse of knowledge a little bit and just assume people don't know anything about the context, the background, why this is important, come back to the beginning.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:18:12):
Yeah, I think another thing that where I learned storytelling is through teaching. So when I was a course assistant for a computer science class and I had to explain pointers, you're like, okay, I really have to borrow on real world metaphors or something that is much more grounding because if you assume a lot of knowledge, then it can be inaccessible to a lot of people. And so if you can tell a story that any student can understand, then you've really done your job. And once you've learn that skill of being able to tell anyone who has no context, then it becomes much easier to turn to these other audiences that are closer and closer.

Lenny (00:18:51):
When I asked you in our newsletter interview what one of the core philosophies of product managers is, in the way you think about product and the role of PM at Figma, an interesting thing that you highlighted is that to you, it's really important that PMs own the why of a product and an idea. And I think it connects to what you're talking about, now. I'm curious just why you think that's so important for product managers and why that's so core to the way you think about product, and at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:19:17):
I really can't remember why I heard this, but it really stuck with me because oftentimes, there's this debate about well, is a PM the person who comes up with the idea. And the answer is usually no, it doesn't have to be at all. And in many cases, in our case, your customers come up with a ton of different ideas and certainly, the what and how are things that are shared within the company and not something that PM uniquely drives. But I do think the why is something that I really always hold the PM uniquely responsible for.

(00:19:48):
And I think the place where I learned this, the importance of this the most, was actually first, at YouTube. I had been working at Microsoft for a long time and I was early in my career, so I was just really focused on my, what we called, our feature crew, our engineer designer, our tester, and just writing specs that really specified exactly how everything works. And so that was the Microsoft culture back then, and your specs had to be perfect, right?

(00:20:19):
Then moved over to YouTube, and all of a sudden, you're responsible for an entire app, and you have a pretty big team, and you cannot specify everything that happens. And so, naturally, designers and engineers are just making their own choices. Made is an error handling situation, and in Microsoft culture, you would've had a table that specifies exactly what happens during that error. But in Google culture, it's like, okay, well the engineers and designers, they can figure it out.

(00:20:47):
So then it's like, how do they make a really great decision? How do they make all these local decisions that you're not a part of, how do you make it so that a great decision's made? And if everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale. So that's where it came from.

(00:21:06):
And then since then, I've started to realize, also, that there are other functions that do this well. So for example, our engineering team at Figma, whenever we do a retro or postmortem, we do this thing called five why's. And it's the idea behind it, it's like, well, why did this happen, outage happen, okay, and why did that thing happen? And go deep enough where you can find the root cause and go fix all those things.

(00:21:28):
And I think a PM can do this, too, which is a customer is asking for a feature, but then you would say, okay, why are they asking for it, and back up the problem. But I think there's one more step you can take, which is, why do they have that problem in the first place? And maybe there's something there, and that could be an opportunity to make a bigger product impact by fixing that underlying condition that created the problem in the first place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
That's so cool that you actually do the five whys. I hear people talking about the five whys all the time, and I don't know, I haven't heard people actually using it. So you actually do this at your post-mortems, you said?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:03):
Yes. Engineering team that's accepting them, yeah.

Lenny (00:22:07):
That's so interesting. Can you talk a bit more about these postmortems? Is this just when something goes wrong or is this just every project you retrospective postmortem thing?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:14):
As it relates to five whys, it's more when something went wrong. But I do think we have a retro culture, [inaudible 00:22:24], where there's always opportunity to make things better. And if you don't create the environments to talk about it, then some of those will go unaddressed forever, so.

Lenny (00:22:33):
Cool. Okay.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:22:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Another attribute of the product team and how you build product at Figma that you shared that was really interesting is you mentioned that you just have an obsession with a proximity to customers, that you make sure your PMs and product team are really close to customers. When you hear that, you're just, imagine everyone listening is like, oh yeah, we're really close to customers, we talk to customers all the time. Of course you got to talk to customers. I'm curious what it is that, maybe, you think sets you apart, in terms of how you think about being close to customers, and if there's a story, maybe, of just, wow, this is how close we are to customers and maybe something that emerged out of that, that'd be really cool to hear.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:23:07):
Well, I think a lot of it starts with our origin story in many ways, which is that way back when, when Dylan, the small group of people were building Figma, this is the time when no one believed it was possible to have a design editor in the browser. And so it just seemed like science fiction, almost. And yet, what Dylan did consistently throughout, was just put the product in front of designers, ask them for feedback, come back to them the next time with that feedback implemented, and it becomes better and better and better.

(00:23:40):
And at no moment was there a tentative expectation that the designer suddenly turns around and implements that tool in their organization. It was really just about listening really carefully to what the community had to say, and through that process, making them evangelists. And that's where a lot of how Figma came to be and why we have such a strong connection with our community where we've actually, they've really helped shape the product to date, and there's a deep belief in that, and they're the ones in that are now advocating for Figma and helping us spread within the community and within their company.

(00:24:20):
So that's the backdrop for why we have such a strong connection with our customers, and there's a lot of things that you see. So for example, maybe someone on my team Sho, and oftentimes, Sho will tweet out to the community, here's what we're thinking, or we're actually thinking about focusing a lot more in prototyping. What are the top problems you're seeing? And people come back with all these different answers because everyone's passionate. And we go in there and just look at all the feedback and understand what people are saying and just have a stronger pulse on how people are feeling. And that's not to say that everything is then implemented verbatim, but we really find it useful to feel like we have a sense of what people are thinking.

(00:25:05):
And I think the most crazy version of it, maybe, is Dylan's always reading customer feedback. In fact, has reads the most customer feedback of all of us and has been doing that for a decade. And oftentimes, there used to be this thing where he would drop in tweets that he sees into different Slack channels to be like, hey, this seems concerning, or we're getting this feedback. And it got to a point where we got big enough where people would feel like they had to drop everything and deal with that tweet.

(00:25:31):
So Chris, our CTO, and I intervened. We created this new channel, private channel called Concerning Tweets, and it just, we're this small group of us that Dylan can drop us in. And these are tweets that aren't going viral, by any means. They're just things that you see is with one like, sometimes zero likes, but he feels there's an essence of truth to them and we make sure that we look at what's going on there and see if there isn't something much bigger that we should be focusing on. But that's the extent to which someone like Dylan, from top down, implements this idea that we need to be staying close to what our users are saying.

Lenny (00:26:13):
That's an awesome idea for a channel, a way to contain that potential madness that it creates. Is there anything else you've learned around hearing feedback like that in a tweet, let's say, or just a few loud voices and deciding what to actually work on? Do you have an approach there? Just deciding what's worth paying attention to?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:26:31):
As we built out our research and data functions, it's really important to balance out the vocal minority with what's actually happening. So I really view some of those tweets more as canaries in the coal mine, in a way, and inputs into, many inputs we have around everything our customers could possibly be experiencing. And it's important to realize that we have certain forums, like our support tickets, where customers are, tend to be much more dissatisfied. And we have other kinds of inputs that are sales conversations with prospects, where it's really more about perceptions around Figma, in some cases.

(00:27:11):
And I think it's just important, especially as a product manager, to feel like you have this balanced portfolio of different kinds of feedback to know that you don't have any blind spots. So I think that's one of the things that I focused a lot on when I came in, which is the Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't. And so building our capabilities to extract feedback or more insight from those other sources, as well.

Lenny (00:27:46):
That reminds me, I think Twitter was really instrumental to the beginnings of Figma. I believe Dylan made this social graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and that was his go-to market strategy, get those designers on Figma, and then I think he open sourced his code to do that. Is that right?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:02):
Yeah, that sounds right to me. And he is very intentional about which designers we need to win over. I think it was very novel at time.

Lenny (00:28:11):
What is it like to work with Dylan Field? As an outsider, he's a legend, feels like he's an incredibly smart, talented, hardworking, CO. There's always tension a little bit between a Chief Product Officer and a CO, and so I'm just curious, what do you like to work with as a product leader? And then, is there, I don't know, a memory that comes to mind of just a way that encapsulates what it's like to work with Dylan?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:28:32):
We're very different, actually. And Dylan is very, he's very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, "You know what? This isn't going to land well," or, "Here's the biggest problem right now." And you're like, well, how does it conclude that? And part of my job is to build out that logic streak for him of how did you arrive at that conclusion so that people can understand that at scale, in a way. But he's very much about that.

(00:29:09):
Or I think there's a way which, sometimes, it's a product manager, you want to lay out a problem and say, okay, we're going to first focus on this problem, and then [inaudible 00:29:21] these three approaches. We're going to take this approach and have a review at every step along the way. But for Dylan, I think, it's very hard for him to really fully get bought into it until he sees the end implementation to viscerally feel if this is a good solution or not. And so I think that's the kind of thinker he is where he really needs to see it to feel it. But it's not totally random. It's based on all these interactions with customers and somehow encoded in him to build up some of those intuitions.

(00:29:55):
And I think one of the things that's really interesting about him is that he actually really cares very deeply about any given user and how they're feeling about Figma. I remember when, during the height of the pandemic, we were doing a one-on-one walking around Delores Park, because this is the era where you would take meetings, if you take meetings, they're all outside, and then he needed to use the bathroom. So he came out to my house in the Castro, he used the bathroom, and then he met my partner, and my partner was on Figma, had Figma pulled up because he is just doing work. And then Dylan just went straight in there and wanted to ask what the biggest problems were or what's not working, and they started geeking out on some issue around Google fonts, and this is the first major interaction between the two of them.

(00:30:45):
But it's one of those things where that's how much Dylan cares. And on one level it's just easy to say, "Hey, this is a single user who just happens to be using your product," and be dismissive with it or not care that deeply because you think you already know all the biggest problems, but that's not his attitude. And so that's the level of, I guess, customer obsession, if you will, that he exhibits and then, in turn, informs his intuitions.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's amazing. Figma is 10 years old at this point. He's been at this for a long time, like a decade. And the fact that he's still so obsessed with just a random person just using Figma and he's taken the opportunity to experience it in real time every chance he gets, sounds like.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:33):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSP files from their customers?

Ashley (00:31:41):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:31:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:31:45):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSP importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering a customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your a-ha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:32:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because Wallace data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:32:36):

(00:32:44):
As an outsider, it feels like Figma is just always firing in all cylinders, shipping the best product. People love it. I use it, I should've mentioned this, but I use it probably every day for my newsletter for illustrations and banners and all this stuff. Yeah, I don't know what I do without it. And it always feels like Figma is just killing it. I know that's never the reality. I'm curious, is there a story of something that just, maybe, didn't work out the way you hoped? Whether it's a feature, a launch, or something like that that just shows people that it's, not everything always works out.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:33:14):
We run experiments all the time that don't come back with winning results, and we certainly have built a lot of more complex features that took a while to take off.

(00:33:24):
So a good example of this is in the design system space, we have something called branching and merging. And branching and merging is this workflow of maybe you're building a really complex design system, and then you don't want anyone ever randomly touching your components that are used by thousands of other projects, so you create this workflow of, someone, maybe, effectively suggesting a change, you're reviewing it and then pushing it in.

(00:33:48):
And so, in theory, makes a lot of sense and things that our customers asked us for, but once we built it, in the initial stages, just didn't really see that much adoption and didn't feel great because it's a really big investment for us. It's a lot of work that we put into it and there's just many different reasons. Some of it was performance, some of it was, this is a foreign workflow and it just takes time, and us helping customers implement some of those workflows, we realized some gaps because we don't really use it that much ourselves.

(00:34:20):
And so, I think as we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are because we've had such a strong culture of internal testing and dogs looting, and those are the things that really helped make sure the quality of our product was good enough. But now we're working with really new types of customers and needing to push ourselves and build that muscle, as well.

Lenny (00:34:54):
Speaking of high quality software, again, I'll repeat, I think Figma is one of the most beloved software products. It's become central to a lot of the ways people work. It's also, I think, one of the fastest growing SaaS products, in general. And I don't know, this is maybe the ultimate softball question, but I'm just curious, what is it that you do at Figma to build such high quality software? Because it's rare for B2B software, especially. What do you do as a product leader, as a product team to just set this high bar, make sure that the stuff that you put out is great consistently, and the more tactical the better?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:35:27):
It's so important that you're using your own products. And I think we're in a very lucky position where all of us can get creative around using Figma in some way. And obviously, designers are the, internally within Figma, are the most vocal and the ones who are in the product six hours a day, essentially. But even for PMs, one of the first things I did when I arrived was we were a little bit more of a memo culture, and I was like, you know what? We should be a deck culture because we can build those decks in Figma, and just that act alone allows you to encounter a lot of issues and for you to get familiar with it.

(00:36:06):
And so I think there are ways in which, sometimes, you have to get creative to enable your company, your entire company to use a product more. Or as an example, recently, we just did calibrations for performance reviews in FigJam, and our Head of Design, Noah, came up with this amazing template and we distributed it through HR and that was another reason for everyone to use FigJam. And so that's the biggest thing. The more hours people are spending inside your product, internally, I think, just naturally becomes better. Because a lot of times, it's not just about people raising their hands and saying this is the problem, it's more about you just want to make your own workflows, your own day-to-day better, and derive satisfaction from improving that.

Lenny (00:36:50):
So the takeaway there is get your product teams to use the product as often as possible. That is a really clever way of doing that at Figma. I know you mentioned in our newsletter interview that you switch from memos to decks. Usually, it goes the other way around, and now I get the second order effects of that where people are building their decks in Figma. That is very clever, and not everyone's building collaboration software, but that is a really clever idea. And I think there's probably a bit of trickle down from Dylan's obsession with the product in making it, just continuing to just be obsessed with making a great experience combined with that, people using the product and this trickle down of we really need to make this as awesome as possible.

Ashley (00:37:27):
There are other companies, for example, when I was at Uber, especially working on the driver's side, of course we went out and driving, and that speaks to some aspects of it. But one of the things that I've realized is when you are logging a bug and you add some engineers to it, to have them look into it, the degree of motivation is so different if that engineer has, somehow, experienced a problem in some way.

(00:37:51):
So for example, everyone at Uber would take Ubers into work, and if an engineer working a driver app saw a driver struggling with something, they would find it embarrassing and feel personally accountable to go and fix that. And when you can create that sense of personal accountability, then all these crazy things happen and all this progress happens. So I think for us, as getting creative at Uber about, okay, well how do we increase those interaction points at the point where, if someone building feels like they have some kind of personal relationship with the end user, and this is what happens, at Figma, too, where a lot of our designers feel personally accountable, in a way, because all their customers are people they already know in the community on Twitter and all those kinds of things, so they feel like they have to put something out there that's defensible or that they're really proud of. So I think that personal accountability can really make a difference.

Lenny (00:38:48):
That begs a question of, I imagine this engineer at Uber coming back to their desk and like, I've got to fix this bug. And then their PM's like, no, we got goals to hit, here's our priorities, we got this roadmap, we don't have time to fix this right now. It's just one random bug. And so there's a two part question, just like you have a approach to that, do you encourage engineers, designers just fix stuff that seems broken/you mentioned that you have a fun experience with OKRs and how you've approached OKRs at Figma, and you've gone back and forth a little bit. And so maybe, as a second part, just talking about your experience with OKRs at Figma.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:39:21):
The first part, I would say that I think one of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms up energy, and maybe a developer noticing something is wrong and just going off and fixing it. And for the most part, I try not to get in the way of that because if people are doing that constantly, and everyone the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top down of, oh, let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things, because you might miss these things. So that's one aspect.

(00:40:01):
And the second thing is, I think a lot of PMs have grown to realize this, which is, if you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different.

(00:40:24):
And that's why getting the buy-in of developers is really important, because you want to feel like they're personally vested in this problem, and then, all of a sudden, their willingness or their creativity, or all these things spike. And so when you think about all those things, when there's a situation where an engineer or a designer's trying to fix a real custom problem, I'm like, by all means.So that's on that.

(00:40:50):
OKR is totally bigger topic, and maybe I'll set the conflicts of why I have such this love-hate relationship with it, which is that a lot of my career, I've actually just worked on core experiences, and OKRs were the bane of my existence, in a way. Because when you're working on a core experience, sometimes you're just, I'm just trying to make the experience better. And sure, I can come up with this BS way to measure what that looks like, but that's not what I'm thinking about every day, anyway. So it just seems very performative, and there's just a lot of work that goes into it.

(00:41:26):
And you encounter one of two situations. One is, you come up with some secondary metric that nobody actually cares about that, technically, you can measure and, technically, you can move, but you haven't actually proven that it really matters. So maybe it is some satisfaction metric that you have on some survey, but you haven't actually done the work to show that, that actually has correlations with retention or anything that actually "matters for real" in the business, or it's some weird usage metric or something like that.

(00:42:00):
And then the other extreme is to say, no, we're going to be ambitious and we're going to send it for business goals. So for example, even if I was the PM for the rider experience at Uber, I'd be like, you know what? We're going to contribute incremental trips because the experience is going to be so good that we can get more people to come back. And I think the reality for a lot of that is, it's a metric that you don't have full control over or there are many hops until it can affect it, and okay, well maybe we can make the experience better and maybe that improves your attention and maybe this. And by the time you get there, you actually can't even prove that you moved the top level metrics. So either you anchor something that matters, but you can't move, or you anchor something that you can't move but doesn't actually matter. So that's the relationship I've had with [inaudible 00:42:45], so even it's really frustrating.

(00:42:47):
So when I write that thinking about, one of the things I realized is that we had OKRs, but people were treating it almost as a to-do list or a task list of, okay, here's how, by the end of quarter, I need to complete these tasks and then I'll feel like I did my job, kind of thing. And we would have these dreadful meetings where we go through these spreadsheets and have people stand up in front of everyone and talk about those commitments, or those key results, rather. But they were dreadful for a reason, which is that you just couldn't really understand what the team actually really cared about. And it got to this point where we had all these, and this is similar to the secondary metric problem, but either you couldn't approve that you actually moved it, or you're trying to work on something that I don't actually understand why it's useful.

(00:43:39):
And so that was when I deprecated it and said, "I just want to understand your headline. What are you trying to do, philosophically?" And just don't stress about whether you can measure it or not. I just don't understand what you're optimizing for, and let's first have that to date. And then once we get there, then let's talk about, okay, well what are some ways that you can measure it? And some of it's qualitative, so it's quantitative, and that's fine. And I almost feel like sometimes, it's better to take the report card approach of saying, Hey, just give yourself a score, tell me how you derive that score, let's all understand that the metrics and those inputs that go into it can change over time, and we're going to get more sophisticated about how we measure it. But at least everyone understands what on earth you're trying to go for.

(00:44:29):
So that's where I moved in my first year, I would say, and then we hired a Head of Data who is a friend of mine from Uber, too. And one of the things she felt was, okay, but it's still very loosey goosey, and super subjective, so let's just try to bring OKRs back and see if we can just do them better next time. And so we've done that, and they were definitely better than when I first arrived just because we had a data science team and we had more rigor around metrics and things like that. But again, this time it was less about not understanding what people were doing, but more not understanding if teams are actually committed to moving those OKRs. And one of the problems that you find is we have these OKRs, but they feel like these post-rationalizations of the projects that you're working on, anyway.

(00:45:17):
And at the end the quarter, you come back and see if those OKRs move, fingers crossed. But if you stop an engineer in the middle of the hallway or the virtual hallway, so to speak, and ask them, okay, what are your team's biggest goals or OKRs? [inaudible 00:45:31], they wouldn't be able to say it. They're just like, well, I'm working on this project that's really important. And so it's, well, what's the point of publishing this OKR if you're actually not thinking about moving it on a daily basis almost, right?

(00:45:46):
And so that's when we've tried to experiment with this terminology, well, maybe if we should call it commitments instead, people would take it a little bit more seriously. And it's my belief that oftentimes, commitments are this care between the why and the what, and sometimes the face of the commitment is the what.

(00:46:05):
It's a project and there are many why's behind it, or it's the why and there are many projects behind it. So that what's trying to formalize that idea, but it definitely felt a little bit complicated, a little bit. Sometimes people are like, well, OKRs exist for a reason and this is, basically, an OKR with just a different name. So my honest sense is we still haven't figured it out and we're still iterating on a bunch of different things, but I think I've developed some philosophies around it, which is, no matter what you call it, because it doesn't matter as much.

(00:46:38):
I think that, for me, there are three things that really matter about the good OKR, and one is legibility. People look at it and understand what it is, and it's not some weird obfuscated metric that doesn't mean anything to anyone. I think actionability, I want OKR to inspire action. You look at that and you're like, it's stirs action, makes me want to do something differently. And the third one is authenticity, which is, does this actually, honestly depict what you're doing, what you're trying to do on a day-to-day basis? Because if it doesn't, then it's hard for me to trust that, that it matters. Or if that's something that just happens to describe what you're doing but isn't really connected in a meaningful way, then I question the value of it all.

(00:47:28):
So that's why I am in the process. But I definitely am all ears to advice around this kind of stuff, because I feel like we haven't quite cracked the code.

Lenny (00:47:38):
I love hearing that. That ,hole journey. I feel like you always hear from product teams, here's what we do now. You never hear, here's the experiments we've been through, here's what we've tried, here's what worked for a while, here's what doesn't work now, and here's what we're doing now. So it's really cool just to hear all the experimentation you've done. Clearly, Figma is a company where you encourage experimentation and trying new things that aren't working, and it's cool they have the flexibility to just like, let's just do headlines for now, and no more specific goal metrics. We're just going to build things that we think are important.

(00:48:09):
And in the newsletter post, for folks that are listening, you actually show the templates that you're using these days for planning your projects and laying out your OKRs, so folks can check those out if they're interested in seeing how you're doing that, now. You also mentioned you've hired this awesome data scientist, and maybe just expanding that further, I imagine a lot of the success of Figma and the product that you built is the people that you hire. At Figma, I believe you have 22 product managers, which sounds very small for a company like Figma, and I imagine they're all amazing. I'm curious what you look for in product leaders and product managers that you hire that, maybe, other folks aren't as focused on, and just what does the interview process look like at Figma?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:48:51):
Yeah, I shared some of these things. I really feel passionately about storytelling, and not to give it away or anything, but one of my favorite interview questions is asking, "describe to me a time when you're part of controversial product decision, and what did you do," and all those things. And I think it's really revealing because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides in such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, then they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives. You start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(00:49:35):
Or sometimes, I just ask them for basic things, okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on. And the thought experiment, for me, is always coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? And no matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager can cash something, it's like, well, this is why it's so existential for us, and this why it's so interesting, and really rally the troops up. So that's one big thing of storytelling communication because at the end of the day, so much of our job, it's around that.

(00:50:07):
I think other than that, some of the things that I value or things I think about as, hi Dan with UX conversations, it's like we talk about problem, and I think about when you're exploring solutions, it's this tree of, okay, there's just these branches of explorations and you finally arrive at these solutions. And a ton of people who can go up and down branches really quickly, have a really high command of all these different altitudes, as well, so that we can talk through a lot of things at the end of the day, feel like we walk away with some progress.

(00:50:43):
And I think that at Uber, our first two Product Officer, Jeff Holden, was someone who often talked about fast forwarding to the future and this idea that, okay, let's just pretend we ran that experiment. What do you think it'll come back with? Or let's pretend we ran that, you just use a study. And the PMs who have the ability to imagine those outcomes, I think, it helps us be much more efficient, too, because we're like, well, if we all think that it's going to go there and that's not going to compel us to take any action, why do it at all?

(00:51:17):
And so I think a lot of PM is about those shortcuts that you have to take. And it's not just about what we build, it's about building the right things. And sometimes, it's just as important to decide not to build something, but it's all only possible if you can have that kind of imagination or that ability to see around corners.

Lenny (00:51:37):
I love that. I was going to ask you for your favorite interview questions in our lightning round and you jumped ahead, which is great. And those are really good examples. Hopefully, they don't give too much away. I want to chat a bit about growth and how Figma grows. If you ask people about product led growth, and just whenever people talk about product led growth, they're always companies like Figma, Slack... Figma is always seen as a model of product led growth and a product that grew through product.

(00:52:04):
I imagine now, there's a very robust sales team, and I imagine, even earlier than people, probably, imagined there was a sales team. I'm curious, as a product leader, what you've learned about how to effectively work with sales and what you teach your product managers about how to work with sales to collaborate effectively.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:52:24):
We're really lucky to have a sales team that understands their product really well and can hold their own with customers who are often also design leaders, product leaders and things like that. And I think that kind of credibility goes a really long way. One of the things that we all are collectively realizing is, we talk about product like growth, but in some ways, I like to think about it more as community led growth or there are certain people inside a company that feel so strongly about Figma and that they're helping push for it in these advocates and evangelizing for Figma.

(00:53:03):
And so oftentimes, what the sales team does is really empower those individuals to make a stronger case or connect them to the rest of the company so that we can get a wider deployment or more leadership buying and things like that. And so oftentimes, a sales team is playing that role of creating those human connections and helping equip designers that feel passionately inside a company with the data, with the stories and all those things to help make a case. And I think that's the most powerful way in which we can spread where the space of Figma is not the sales team, but in fact, it's the internal designer.

(00:53:47):
And so that's the mental model that I think we've been using it. We're fortunate enough to have people inside companies who are so passionate to want to play that role. And so when you take that lens on, then you start to understand, okay, how can we help set this person up for success? And the sales team has different ways to do it. The product team can help, in terms of giving them visibility into how we're thinking about evolving the product or what other customers might be doing. And so, I really see it as this partnership to enable that much as possible. And I think that's what, to me, product growth looks like at Figma, is that.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That is really interesting. Basically, making your champion inside the company a superhero, helping them be more effective at what they're already doing, which is evangelizing this product that they really love. Interesting.

(00:54:42):
Is there anything that you think Figma did early on that you think was really important for it to start to grow, either in this way or in a different way? Imagine there's just a lot of product led growth founders that are trying to create a product led growth product, and they fail. And so I'm curious, just what do you think people often miss and what do you think Figma did right that got it going?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:55:02):
I think a lot of it was about the level of intention around building community. And the more there are organic conversations happening about Figma, the better. And one of the nice things about Figma is you can share out a file that you've been working on, and effectively open source something, but it's your way of showing, here's how we do it at so X, Y, Z company, and sharing that with the rest of the community. And when people see that and when people feel like they have this insider view in how other companies work, that's where there's a lot of interest.

(00:55:38):
And more recently, over the last few years, we've really been focused on a program called Friends of Figma where we have people who are passing about Figma, and all our different geographies come together in a Discord channel. They meet regularly and are helping us evangelize. And again, that's that human connection between users, and then between us and the users is something that really helps build that kind of loyalty, which is the thing that, then, fuels all the champions to really push for it, internally, and give people the enthusiasm and courage to do that inside their organization.

Lenny (00:56:16):
It's interesting how many corollaries there are to Notion and how they got started. I recently chatted with Camille, I don't know if you heard that episode, but there's a lot of similarities with how Notion use their community to help jumpstart growth and continue to grow.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:29):
Totally.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It's interesting that you can call that community growth, product growth. There's a lot of overlap there, potentially.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:36):
For sure.

Lenny (00:56:37):
What advice would you have for folks that are, I don't know, maybe you already shared this, but just if you're a product led growth founder listening to this, do you have any other piece of advice to that founder about how to get started with their product, their community, their growth strategy? Anything else you'd want to share there?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:56:52):
Maybe a different way to talk about what we just talked about, is just, there has to be this, almost irrational, this emotional response to your product and this like love for it. First, it has to be cultivated internally, too. People, internally, have to authentically love something to really stand behind it. But then, externally, too, if people are loving something to the point where they can sing at the top of their lungs and just really talk about how Figma's, great, if we can get there, that's a wonderful place to be.

(00:57:27):
And I think that's both a combination of you've really solved their problems well, but you also equip people with a philosophy around a different way of working. And I think that's what worked well for Figma, too, which is, there's something controversial about this idea that everyone can see what you're doing, or that multiple designers can be in the file at the same time. We like to say that one of the first responses we saw [inaudible 00:57:51] Figma was, if this is a future of design, I'm quitting. I'm changing careers. And there's that tension of that narrative tension, but that is signal that you're part of this revolution and you're trying to change something. And when it can equips your customers or user base with that, and I think that's something that they can really get behind and champion, so it's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for a new way of working.

(00:58:20):
Obviously, that's a tall order or [inaudible 00:58:23] come up with that. But hopefully, if your a founder, you're working on something, your mission is so big that you have those kind of ideas, and it's how do you actually equip your customers to want to talk about that?

Lenny (00:58:35):
That's awesome. Reminds me of a quote and a tagline that the Airbnb's first growth team had for a long time. Love drives growth, not the other way around. They made posters of this, put it all over the product teams.

Yuhki Yamashita (00:58:48):
I love that.

Lenny (00:58:49):
Part of the office and seemed to have worked for Airbnb, clearly working for Figma.

(00:58:54):
One last question feels like a question we have to touch on. I don't know how much you can say about all this stuff, but with the potential acquisition with Adobe, which I know isn't done, yet, but I'm just curious, what do you think will change, may change, you're hoping will change, you're hoping won't change in how you build product at Figma within Adobe?

Yuhki Yamashita (00:59:12):
Totally. Yeah. As you said, it hasn't closed, yet, and so we're still independent companies, but when we think about that theoretical future, I think about people often ask me, so what's going to happen, in terms of the products that you work on, and how is that going to influence Figma? And the answer is, we don't know, yet, but I get excited about two avenues. One is just really continuing our current mission of making product design better. And the reality is we look at product design, a lot of people are still using both Adobe and Figma alongside each other. And maybe you're creating that micro interaction in After Effects, or maybe you're doing that intricate illustration in Illustrator, or editing Raster in Photoshop, and then you're bringing some of those things into Figma. But when you think about the end product development process, there's so many ways in which, if we can make all those things seamless so that you're not juggling a bunch of apps, or maybe you can have one single source of truth, that's really exciting to me to think about. So concretely what that means, I don't know, yet, but as thinking through those journeys, that gets exciting for me.

(01:00:22):
And then the other thing is really collaborating with the rest of Adobe and thinking about, we've figured out something really interesting in the form of realtime multiplayer collaboration, and that, as a platform. Adobe has a much broader set of use cases that they've been pursuing, and what do those two things together, what could that enable? And that gets exciting for me to think about all the creative tools that I've used in the past, be it video editing or 3D objects or things like that where it's, okay, if we can bring in the power of the browser, of multiplayer, of this feeling of openness, would that make it way easier for people? Would it make it much easier for people to share work or get involved?

(01:01:04):
So those are the things that go through my heads, in terms of what's possible. In terms of what I don't want change. I really think that we've figured out something really amazing, in terms of our relationship with the community. We talked about proximity to community and our users. Those are things that we intend to keep and keep doubling down on. And I think it's such an important part of the magic of how Figma works. So it's something that, I think, I will continue to do and that's what I draw a lot of motivation from in the first place.

Lenny (01:01:34):
Awesome. You also get to work with Scott Delski, which is going to be pretty sweet and hoping to get Scott on this podcast at some point, too.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:41):
That'll be awesome.

Lenny (01:01:42):
Any closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:01:46):
It's really easy to listen to some of these podcasts and feel like, oh, these people have kind of figured everything out.

(01:01:53):
But the reality is, we haven't, and we're still experimenting with a lot of things. OKRs is a really good example of that, but a lot of other things. And so, just the other day I wrote about this idea of us living in a work in progress world, and I was talking about more from the context of we live in a world where all of our products, our product players, our strategies are work in progress, and how do you work in a world like that, when what you're reviewing can change the next day.

(01:02:23):
But in a similar way, I think the way we work, the way we run product processes as product managers is, itself, very much a work in progress. So I would love to encourage this kind of conversation, Lenny, that you're facilitating just because you have so much to learn from each other. And I'd love to continue to learn more from all of you on interesting ways that you grapple with these age old problems around things like how to set goals, or how to review work, or how to plan.

(01:02:54):
So anyway, just wanted to signal that we are very far from perfect, and I really eager to learn from everyone else, as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
I love that. That also reminds me of something the Airbnb founders always came back to. Joe and Brian were both designers, and as you learn to be a designer, you are taught that everything around you is designed by someone. Someone just decided this webcam's going to look this way and work in this way, this chair, somebody decided very specifically, it's going to be like this. And we assume the things that we are working within are just, they're figured out. Someone much smarter than me figure this out. But it's usually just someone just like you that had to figure something out quickly, and then that's what you're doing now. And so they always encouraged everyone to just remember someone designed this, doesn't mean it's the perfect solution, and you should always rethink things like that and not assume.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:44):
Yep.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six short quick questions for you. I'll just go through them pretty quick, whatever comes to mind, share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good? All right.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:03:56):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Awesome. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other folks?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:02):
First one that comes to mind is Switch, and it's really about how to affect organizational change, something that's Shishir recommended to me and we have the difficulty of affecting change in a large organization, basically, and how to overcome that.

(01:04:16):
The second one I would say is my favorite book of all time is one called The Story of the Stone, and it's a Chinese novel, one of the most famous Chinese novels of all time. And it's thousands of pages. It all takes place in a garden, but it's one of the most beautiful piece of work I've read, so I like to recommend that, even though it's nothing to do with PM.

Lenny (01:04:38):
Did you say thousands of pages?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:04:41):
About a stone. Wow. I will check this out. I love it. I've not heard this one before. Favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:04:49):
Well, I'll have to admit, I'm actually much more of a visual learner, not a listener, and so I rarely listen to podcasts, but the two that I have listened to, in earnest, was first one was Cereal a long time ago, and then yours.

(01:05:04):
So I think some of the best, actually, but otherwise, more into reading.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Awesome. This show's also on YouTube, for folks that don't listening and like watching things. Plug, plug. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:18):
The last movie I watched was called The Good Nurse, and it was about a serial killer working in a hospital, but it was a very different take on it. It was very human. It wasn't grotesque at all, and was talking about how broken our system was. So, highly recommend it. Quite sad, but yeah.

Lenny (01:05:37):
Okay, good tip. What are some SaaS products that you love that you, maybe, use at Figma or that you just discovered that you find very useful?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:05:45):
Kind of cheating, but as I mentioned earlier, we're starting to use FigJam for everything from calibrations, to interview debriefs, to product reviews, to everything. So that's thoroughly started to dominate our usage. It's been cool to see. And then we have our usual suspects like Slack and Asana, and then we're all over the place on the rest. Some of us use Notions, some of these use Dropbox Paper, some of these uses Koda, and so we're still figuring that one, out, I'd say.

Lenny (01:06:16):
Dropbox Paper. Very cool.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:06:18):
I love that product, but I feel like no one uses it anymore, but it's cool that you guys do. Final question, favorite FigJam or Figma plugin or template?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:06:27):
We have this one called the Alignment Scale, which is a widget that you can insert into FigJam or Figma Design, actually. And we use it all the time. So basically, it's just a simple scale and whenever people click it, their face appears on one end of the spectrum or the other. And so it's our quick way of being like, we're doing a product review, we on a pulse check, we drop it in and we're like, how are people feeling aligned, not aligned?

(01:06:52):
And if people are aligned, we just move on. If not, then you know that it's worth a discussion. So it's just a fast way to figure out where all the hotspots are.

Lenny (01:07:01):
Awesome. And if folks want to find that, they can actually go to the newsletter interview that we did. I think if you just Google how Figma builds product, it comes up number one, and then there's a link to actual template, so you can plug that right in.

(01:07:13):
Yuhki, thank you so much for being here. I am going to go play with Figma and FigJam right after this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, learn more? Are you guys hiring, anything there? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Yuhki Yamashita (01:07:30):
Yes, you can find me online on Twitter or LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out there.

(01:07:36):
In terms of how you can be useful to us? We're really starting to build a lot of products for this audience, for product managers. FigJam is one example of this, so definitely try it out, give us the feedback, tell me all about all the cool things that you're doing or you wish you could do on FigJam or Figma. And you can tweet at me, you can find me anywhere. And, of course, we're also hiring, so if you know great people or are interested, yeah, there's a lot of roles, so please get in touch.

Lenny (01:08:06):
Awesome. Yuhki, thank you so much for being here.

Yuhki Yamashita (01:08:08):

# Lessons from Airtable’s unconventional growth strategy | Zoelle Egner

## Transcript

Zoelle Egner (00:00:00):
There is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:00:35):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
Lenny (00:01:02):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Zoelle Egner. Zoelle was one of the earliest employees at Airtable, where she led their early marketing and customer success teams, and generally just helped Airtable grow into the legendary business that it is today. She also spent time in Box. She's advised dozens of startups on marketing and growth, and is now head of marketing and growth at a startup called Block Party. 
(00:01:32):
In our conversation, Zoelle shares how to punch above your weight as a startup, the most effective and impactful growth and marketing tactics throughout Airtable's history, including their use of billboards, marketing investments that are often high ROI, and those that are rarely a good use of time, why PR and launches are actually useful to startups, and also when they aren't, and a lot more. It was so much fun chatting with Zoelle, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Zoelle Egner after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(00:02:03):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences, from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SMTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like, "Error on line 53." And never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.
(00:03:10):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach, so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

Zoelle Egner (00:04:12):
Hi, thanks for having me.
Lenny (00:04:14):
It's very much my pleasure. Something that is pretty cool is that we actually met in my newsletter Slack community. I actually looked this up of how we actually started chatting, and it was me cold DMing you to get a discount on Airtable for the newsletter subscribers. And you very happily got me that, hooked us up, and then you became a go-to Airtable person for advice on what Airtable did right and wrong over the years. And so thank you for being that person and also I'm really excited to have you on this podcast and to learn from you.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:43):
I am super excited to chat.
Lenny (00:04:45):
Awesome. You're probably best known for your time at Airtable, which, correct me if I'm wrong, you're employee number 11.
Zoelle Egner (00:04:53):
That's right.
Lenny (00:04:55):
Okay, and at Airtable you led marketing, you led the customer success teams, so we're going to chat about all that stuff. But before we get into that, I want to chat briefly about this other project that you worked on, that from the outside felt like a really fascinating thing, and a really impactful project, and a really cool team. And it's called Vaccinate California, I think, is that how you pronounce it?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
Mm-hmm.
Lenny (00:05:13):
See, I just-
Zoelle Egner (00:05:13):
VaccinateCA.
Lenny (00:05:15):
VaccinateCA. Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about what this was? What were you trying to do? What was the impact you had? How did it all go?
Zoelle Egner (00:05:21):
Yeah, absolutely. So VaccinateCA existed to help people in California find and get a COVID vaccine as quickly as possible, and that sounds really trivial right now, but you have to wind back to January of 2020, when vaccines were first coming out, and it was really hard. So just as a reminder, because most of us have blocked that from our memory. 
Lenny (00:05:40):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:05:41):
The federal and state systems didn't really exist yet, and so everything was this horrible hodgepodge, where eligibility depended on not only what state you were in, it was down to the county, and even sometimes the individual facility. You would be at a Walgreens, and talk to them, and they'd be like, "Oh, you have to be over 65, and also in one of these 12 categories of employment in order to get the vaccine." And then you'd go a mile away and they would tell you something totally different. So people would stand in line for hours. There were phones going off the hook, utterly madness, and really, really scary for a lot of people who were trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe. 
Lenny (00:06:17):
Yeah, I remember those days well.
Zoelle Egner (00:06:19):
Yeah. So this organization was founded essentially by a tweet by Patrick McKenzie, for those of you who are on Hacker News Patio11. And he had basically this really simple premise, which is, "If you call a pharmacist, and you ask them who they can give a vaccine to, and what vaccine they have, and then you put that answer on a map, someone else doesn't have to make the same phone call. And that takes lots of pressure also as a healthcare system and also helps people to match supply and demand." 
(00:06:47):
So surprisingly, somehow, that tweet, which is essentially like, "Call people, put in spreadsheet, put online," turned into an entire, full nonprofit that was mostly on Discord, Zoom, Airtable, and not only had this entire hundreds of volunteers who were making phone calls in the state of California and eventually, actually, nationally, we became Vaccinate The States eventually, we were also doing this thing called web banking. So we would go and scrape all the official sources as they started coming out, and then validate them because they were not always correct. And eventually we had the most comprehensive database and map of locations in the entire country, including more comprehensive than the federal government and most of the states because they had really complicated limitations on what they could and couldn't publish based on some relationships they had. We didn't have those limitations.
(00:07:37):
So it meant that we became this clearing house, essentially, for this information and we built an API. We were working directly with Google. And if you ever looked up vaccine locations on Google Maps, that was us feeding that to them, which was really cool. And we also made maps you could see on county websites, so it would help you understand what was available in your area. One of the coolest things that I've ever worked on.
Lenny (00:08:01):
Okay, exactly. That's exactly I imagined how epic this was. Just to make sure people understand what you're describing, basically you had hundreds of people sitting there on phones calling vaccine locations, getting the specifics of who is able to get a vaccine there, and then just giving people a pointer of where they can get a vaccine.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:18):
Exactly. So I came in initially, a colleague of mine at Airtable had been helping out with the building out of the backend. And they started getting media attention. And they thought, "Oh, well this will help more people understand that this resource is available." So I got brought in to do some PR help, basically help them figure out how to get the word out, and then ended up actually quitting my job at Airtable to work on it full-time.
Lenny (00:08:40):
Oh wow.
Zoelle Egner (00:08:41):
Yeah, I was on the board and also managing all outreach and other stuff. So we did lots of really cool education, helping people understand their eligibility at all. Built a bunch of fun tools for that as well, but it was a pretty incredible six months, where we filled a really critical gap in the infrastructure of the country. 
Lenny (00:08:58):
It's wild that was the best solution, is just call people and create your own. 
Zoelle Egner (00:09:03):
You know?
Lenny (00:09:03):
I imagine there was, at Airtable, were you using to store the data?
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
Oh yes. 
Lenny (00:09:07):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:09:07):
We built an entire insane database, and then eventually custom software on top of that, to make the people who are making the phone calls more easily get the information in. It was a whole thing. Very cool to see, though, not just tech people get involved. We had, in our volunteer base, people from absolutely every walk of life, not just in California, globally. I remember there was a volunteer who said that he decided to join, he was based in Israel, and he had had no trouble getting the vaccine whatsoever, but seen something on Twitter about it, and just decided he wanted to make sure that people were able to get the vaccine as easily as he did. And he spent dozens of hours calling folks, even though he was in a totally different time zone. But really lovely to see all these different people, retired teachers. I think we had a bunch of 12 year olds who were helping out on the code, of all things, all who just really wanted to make sure that they could keep their community safe.
Lenny (00:10:02):
What happened with this organization? It's a nonprofit that now continues to run or what's happening?
Zoelle Egner (00:10:06):
No, we did something which is not common. We actually decided to shut it down after six months. Partially, that's because the existing system finally caught up. And frankly we didn't want to be in a place where we were pulling away resources that could be put towards other things that are going to be more impactful. We always saw ourselves as a stop gap, and once we got to the place where we felt like we weren't really being additive, we wanted to get people's time back, so they could work on other things. So it doesn't exist anymore. I think you can still go check out the archive. We found some researchers who are doing interesting research on it, because there's very fascinating data in there about the equitability of some of the distribution of the vaccine based on where it was available, but the organization is gone. We had that beautiful moment in time and have all moved on. Hoping we don't have to get the band back together, because hopefully it's not necessary anymore.
Lenny (00:10:58):
Oh, man. I'm watching The Last of Us right now about this-
Zoelle Egner (00:11:02):
Mushroom people.
Lenny (00:11:03):
... mushroom based disease, and that scares me now. 
Zoelle Egner (00:11:06):
Yep.
Lenny (00:11:06):
Anyway, on this podcast I try to get to things people learn from these experiences, and so I have to ask what you learn about forming something like this, just ad hoc, pulling a bunch of people together, and having them focus, and get things done, or just scaling it, or even shutting down. I guess what have you taken away from that experience that you maybe will bring to either future one-off things like this or even just your work in general?
Zoelle Egner (00:11:31):
Yeah, I'd say probably three things. One, the incredible power of a simple idea to bring people together. One of the reasons why VaccinateCA was so powerful and got so many people to help is everybody immediately understood why it would be useful and how they specifically could be making a difference. And combining those two things was an incredible way to bring a lot of people on board very quickly, because from a messaging perspective, messaging, something very important to me as a marketer, it was so concise. Like, "Pick up phone, help save lives." Really straightforward. People really, really got that. It allowed them to feel like they had agency in a time when everything felt really, really out of control. I think there's a lot of opportunities we have to activate our communities and give people that sense of control that are both going to be helpful more broadly for society, but also just for those individuals as well to make them feel a little bit more safe, a little bit more like they can actually have a difference in things. 
(00:12:34):
I think in tech we often don't jump into these problems. This was not sophisticated technology. It was phones, Discord, and Airtable mostly being used like a spreadsheet. It wasn't anything wild. Even that very simple infrastructure was enough to make a huge difference. And we have some evidence that we saved a lot of lives as a result of it, which is pretty special. I think part of it is also just saying, "We don't have to be hesitant to jump into these problems. It's important to engage with experts in the field, is not to say that tech solutionism is always the answer." And again, this is not super sophisticated technology, but because we were able to go in and talk to the people who are actually affected, get into the system that already existed, and make something really simple, really fast, it actually did have a huge difference and that's really exciting.
Lenny (00:13:24):
Just to double-click on that one, actually reminds me, some founders of companies I've invested in, I often hear how much easier it is for companies that have a mission that people are excited about for them to hire versus companies that don't. And so it's a really good reminder of just the power of having a mission and a vision that is really compelling to people versus some B2B software that people aren't [inaudible 00:13:47] excited about, even though there's a great reason to have great B2B software. Love B2Bs.
Zoelle Egner (00:13:50):
There are. I love great B2B software. I've spent most of my career on it. But I agree with you. I think if you have an authentic mission and people aren't just like, "Oh, sure, okay. You're connecting the world." But really it's some telephony startup. Like, "Okay."
Lenny (00:13:50):
Yeah. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:05):
If people feel like it's genuinely authentic to what you're building, it can be incredibly meaningful.
Lenny (00:14:11):
Yeah. I just remember a founder who, he is a second company, because the first company did not have an amazing mission. The second one did. And like, "Wow. So much easier to hire for this new startup."
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:14:20):
So totally get that. 
Zoelle Egner (00:14:20):
Absolutely. 
Lenny (00:14:22):
Okay, number two and three.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:23):
Number two and three, I'll try and be more brief. 
Lenny (00:14:25):
It's all good.
Zoelle Egner (00:14:26):
Number two, I would say just the importance of relentlessly repeating the exact same stuff over and over again, even if you feel like everyone definitely knows. This is something that I've seen play out in every single leadership role that I've had, but it was never more acute than here, particularly because we had this broad coalition of hundreds of people with very different backgrounds. Some people coming to the meeting, some people not, whatever else. I think I repeated the same three talking points about why what we were doing mattered 5,000 times. Cannot overemphasize how many times I said the same stuff, and so did every other member of the board. It really is important and people will fill in the blanks with totally wild things if you don't continuously have that discipline of repeating yourself. You just have to get used to saying the same stuff. And if you do it correctly, it's super motivating. Even if you're sitting there being like, oh my gosh, "I have to say it again." it's worth it.
Lenny (00:15:22):
This reminds me, I don't know where I saw this, it's just in my head right now, that the CEO and founder's job, their actual title is repeater in chief.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:22):
It absolutely should be.
Lenny (00:15:31):
It resonates. Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:31):
I've worked with some leaders who never wanted to. They're like, "No, this is going to be boring for people." And you just have to be like, "Honestly, most people are never listening as much as you think that they are."
Lenny (00:15:39):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:15:39):
"We wish that they would. But you have to say it 12 different ways in writing, and out loud, and all this other stuff. You're never as important as you think you are, unfortunately, when it comes to that." 
Lenny (00:15:48):
Oh, these are great lessons. Okay. What else do you tell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:15:51):
I think my last learning was really about the power of having a laughably small MVP for something. By the end of this, we were covering the entire United States. We had an API, we had custom software on the front end, this whole behemoth of stuff that we got to in four months or something. In the beginning it was truly, basically, a spreadsheet, and phones, and that was it. Even that, for the first few weeks while we were getting the rest of the infrastructure really going, not only had tremendous impact at one of the most important parts in the pandemic, but also gave us so much information about we actually needed to build that was going to be helpful. And I remember having all of these assumptions about what was going to be necessary to manage this coalition of people to make sure that we had really good data quality.
(00:16:41):
Because one of the most important things you can do if you're trying to be a trusted source of truth is actually have the correct information. Sounds trivial, it's not at all at that scale. And I was totally wrong about all my assumptions. I thought we were going to have to have totally different types of oversight. I thought we were going to have totally different tooling. And it turned out we could do something way lighter weight that would allow us to move much faster as the regulatory landscape kept changing, as all the rule making at individual places kept changing. And that agility, that willingness to do just the smallest possible thing is obviously a little bit of a trope in the industry. 
(00:17:15):
People talk about it a lot, but it's never been driven home to me so much, because we're talking about something that had incredibly high stakes as people's health, and we're still able to do it in that context. So if we could do it there, you can imagine that the applications of that in other industries are just tremendous. So yeah, if you're listening to this, and you were thinking maybe you needed to add more stuff, I bet you could prune.
Lenny (00:17:39):
And it's nice to have the forcing function where the world is changing so quickly and the team's probably small, where you are forced to build small. Which I think is why this reminder is so important. Oftentimes you have more resources, and you end up building more just because you can. And yeah, what you're saying is oftentimes, "It'll shoot you in the foot."
Zoelle Egner (00:17:55):
Yes.
Lenny (00:17:56):
Amazing. I didn't expect to get into this much detail with VaccinateCA and so I'm glad we did. Let's zoom out a little bit, and just fill in some gaps on your background, briefly. Can you just highlight some of the other wonderful things you've done in career? Airtable, we talked about, VaccinateCA, just broadly, what else have you been up to? 
Zoelle Egner (00:18:13):
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so I'll try and be brief. I worked in tech for more than a decade, mostly marketing and customer success, a little bit of ops. Before I got into tech, I was a little bit of a dilettante, so some non-profit, healthcare, dying big box retail, because I graduated right into the recession and I was certain no one would hire me. Turns out that was actually wrong. But on the plus side, now I know what dysfunction looks like at great scale, which is actually quite an education and very useful. But I always knew I wanted to get into tech, partially because I'm from the Bay area, and partially because I had been obsessively power mapping the industry, and looking at its flocking patterns, and who had what types of influence, because I'm a nerd. And I really wanted to see if I could get in, in the first place. Because- 
Lenny (00:18:59):
Wait, can you talk about this, which, what is it you did? What did you call, a flocking pattern?
Zoelle Egner (00:19:05):
Sure. You can imagine in any community, there are nodes of influence, people who know a lot of folks, they have money, whatever it might be. And they're able to direct how that community or that ecosystem evolves. In the tech industry, typically VCs will often play a role in this, but so will certain types of executives. And you can follow how they move between different companies, and who they worked with, and then see that influences who gets investment in the future. It influences the different partnerships that evolve. It influences the assumed wisdom in various different careers. And because I'm a big old nerd, I was literally drawing diagrams based on-
Lenny (00:19:48):
Whoa.
Zoelle Egner (00:19:48):
... reading people's blog posts of who was influential in what way? Because I was non-technical. I tried programming, and I hated it, frankly. And so I was like, "Okay, it's 2010, it's 2011. There's not clear ways to get into the industry as a non-technical person. I need to figure out how to do this with people. Because otherwise I'm not sure why someone would take a chance on me with what I have done historically. And that sounds a little insane, but it's very effective. And I ended up getting my start in tech basically by identifying a company where I thought I had a unique set of connections or understanding of the space that they were working in, where I thought I could maybe email the CEO and be helpful.
Lenny (00:20:29):
And did this connect to that diagram you drew? Did this help you point in that direction?
Zoelle Egner (00:20:34):
Yeah, absolutely. So I was closely tracking YCombinator and that whole ecosystem. So I knew I wanted to find a smaller company, where they maybe were having more difficulty hiring, because they were less well known or a little bit less, I don't know, sexy. But while they were still connected into that broader group, because it has with a pedigree that people would take you seriously if you had worked at a YC backed startup.
Lenny (00:20:55):
Right.
Zoelle Egner (00:20:55):
Anyway, I got really pointy hat strategic about this, but it was effective. 
Lenny (00:21:00):
Do you still-
Zoelle Egner (00:21:00):
And-
Lenny (00:21:00):
... have this diagram, by the way? It'd be so funny to look at it right now.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
No, I don't think I have it anymore. I might be able to dig it up, but alas, I think it may have been lost in one of my many moves since then. 
Lenny (00:21:03):
All right.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
It's been-
Lenny (00:21:03):
No problem.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:03):
... more than a decade. 
Lenny (00:21:18):
Okay. I imagine that was true. Okay, so I think I cut you off. You were talking about some of the things you've done in your career.
Zoelle Egner (00:21:20):
Yeah, ended up using my studies of the space to get into a role as employee one at a developer focus YC backed startup. And the funny story on that is that I got that role by cold emailing the CEO while I was still in college. And then he actually followed up with me almost immediately, because I'd offered to introduce him to some professors, which was useful for the type of business. And then I ignored him for two years because I got busy with my thesis, and got other jobs, and whatever, came back to it and wrote this ridiculous apology email, being like, "I promise I respond to emails faster. I see that you're hiring. Would you give me a second chance? Please, can I come work for you? I have no experience that's useful, but I work really hard." And I figured he would either laugh me off of the internet or give me a job, and very fortunately for me, he gave me a job. So thanks, Ryan. Appreciate that. That was how I got into tech.
Lenny (00:22:11):
Thanks, Ryan. 
Zoelle Egner (00:22:12):
Yes, we appreciate it. So that startup got acquired by Box. And when I went over to Box, they had never had paying developers before. So we were bringing over seven figure contracts. So I started developer success programs there. And then in a totally wild shift, I ended up moving over to run their social media editorial and internal comms, which doesn't sound related to developer success, but I had always been a writer, and I wrote this blog post about what it was like to be an early stage non-technical employee. There was a little spicy, talking about some of the challenges, and I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it. And I got this email from PR being like, "We need to have a meeting." And I was like, "Oh, they're going to fire me. I went too far." I thought I was being circumspect, that I went too far. And in the meeting they were like, "Hey, we really think you should apply for this job. We would love to have you run social media." Which is not the outcome I expected.
Lenny (00:23:05):
That's a cool learning, there. Just like, "Do stuff." You know? "Don't be afraid."
Zoelle Egner (00:23:08):
Yeah, it was definitely not the expected outcome, but one that was very exciting. So got to go run those programs for a couple years through the IPO, which is a whole education in and of itself, to see how comms changes when you become a public company. And then I was on Hacker News obsessively at the time, and I saw the beta for Airtable come out. Immediately signed up, and became obsessed with the product, and evangelizing it to everybody that I knew and ultimately ended up figuring out a way to finagle my way into that role as employee 11 there. 
(00:23:43):
And it sounds like we're going to talk about Airtable more, so I won't belabor that, but marketing and customer success stuff, ended up leaving for VaccinateCA, and then the last little bit here is just when that ended, I really thought I wanted to start my own company. So I gave myself a certain window in which to try out different ideas, and at the same time was advising and consulting. Ultimately didn't end up finding anything that I felt so much conviction that it was worth blowing up absolutely everything else about my life in order to go heads down on a company. So eventually decided to go in-house with one of the companies I've been advising, Block Party, and now I run marketing and growth there.
Lenny (00:24:19):
Can you just explain Block Party briefly? [inaudible 00:24:21]-
Zoelle Egner (00:24:21):
Absolutely. We're an online safety company. We help users have more control over their digital experience. And our first product is anti-harassment and anti-spam tools for Twitter.
Lenny (00:24:30):
So you've worked at Box, Airtable, now Block Party. You've advised a lot of companies around marketing product growth. I'm curious if there's a thread that has maintained through all of those experiences in terms of what works well for marketing, and growth, and things you've learned that just consistently- [inaudible 00:24:52]
Zoelle Egner (00:24:52):
A few pieces that go into how I choose companies that create that thread. And part of this is about me wanting to match what I think I'm really good at with what will have the greatest leverage for a company that I work at. I've mentioned I'm a writer, really care about telling stories, and helping people to understand new or novel things. I also really care about product quality. I'm a little bit of a product snob. And one of my strengths is enthusiasm. So if I can't genuinely go to a customer and tell them, "This product is going to solve a real problem for you and it's going to be amazing." I can't do my job. So all of the companies that I've chosen to go to have had this foundation of an incredible product experience that maybe people didn't fully understand, and where I could come in and help connect the dots between that amazing product that's going to be really, really helpful and the opportunities for a much wider range of people to benefit from that.
(00:25:46):
So in practice, what that means is I often end up working at companies that are in a position to really punch above their weight from a brand perspective. They're typically much lower headcount than you would ever expect. They're typically way earlier stage than you would expect, but I've been able to put together a brand or an experience that allows people to invest themselves into the company with a high level of trust, I guess. 
(00:26:13):
I'll be more specific because that's really ambiguous. Airtable, it manages mission critical workflows, highly sensitive data. It's super important. You only use tools you can trust for that type of thing. The same thing is true at Block Party, online safety. You have to trust the company that you're entrusting your safety to. And in my experience, people, and especially founders really underestimate how much every single touchpoint a customer has from word of mouth or the ad that brings them in the door, landing pages, signup flows, customer service experiences. Every single one of those moments is building a brand that is adding or removing trust.
(00:26:48):
So for me in the early days, that means thinking about like, "What are the signals that I can provide to future customers that say, 'We understand you specifically, and our solution is designed for a person like you.' And two, that will say, 'Hey, we're actually operating on a much higher level than you might expect for a company of our size or our stage. We take this really seriously. We have all the things in place to take care of you. So you shouldn't be afraid to spend six figures or put your safety in our hands because we've got your back. We're doing this the right way.'" Has tremendous dividends when you're in a business that is often driven by word of mouth. Because if you take care of people and you follow up that brand experience with a product experience that is really powerful and actually does the things that says it's going to do, then your word of mouth can become a huge driver of growth for the company.
(00:27:40):
Of course, the outcome of this in practice is really funny. So I remember really distinctly having to invite customers to go out to lunch with us when they would come to San Francisco back in the Airtable days, because we had 15 people in a teeny tiny office. It's not that I wanted to mislead anyone, but I didn't need to reinforce the fact that they were spending six figures with us when we had 15 people. If they had gone to look on LinkedIn, they could have figured that out, but we didn't need to remind them that we were so small, and they were running some of their most important processes with our product. I think I was on the phone with Slack at one point. And they were like, "Oh, well you guys are probably about the same size company as we are, right?" And I was like, "Not quite. A little smaller, just an entire order of magnitude, no big deal, it's totally fine. We're all smooth. We'll take care of you. It's going to great." But it-
Lenny (00:27:40):
Amazing.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:27):
... really makes a difference, all of those little things.
Lenny (00:28:31):
That reminds me, I heard stories of very early Airbnb days where they had to take meetings in a bathroom, or in the hallway, and they did interviews, I think in the hallway because there was no space.
Zoelle Egner (00:28:41):
We did a lot of calling from the hallway at Airtable, also from this weird internal patio you could only get to through climbing through a window. The window kept breaking. And so I, at one point, remember someone getting stuck outside trying to interview someone with the windows closed. Utter, utter ridiculous nonsense. But you know, that's all the fun things that happened in the early days before you become bigger.
Lenny (00:29:06):
Yeah, I love those early day stories. 
Zoelle Egner (00:29:08):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:29:09):
I really love the concept of punching above your weight as a startup. What else did you do at Air Table or other places that help you do that? One is just don't let them see how small you are, necessarily. Are there any other technical things you recall that like, "Oh, here's things that really worked really well for punching above our weight as a small company at that point."
Zoelle Egner (00:29:29):
A couple of these things are very unsexy, but very useful. One, make sure that your landing pages, and your emails, and other things have a level of polish that makes them feel a little bit more done. I think there is sometimes a recommendation or an instinct just like, "Ship things super, super quickly and get them out there." And I'm not saying don't move fast. Obviously you need to move fast in the early days, but make sure someone rereads your email so that it sounds good. Invest in having a decent photo or a decent illustration. If you have sample content, this is actually a big one, sample content for your productivity app as an example. Take the time to not have it be like Jane Doe 12 times in the name list. Have it be references to your industry so that people are like, "Oh, hey. That's a joke about Steve Jobs. I'm a designer. This person is thinking about me."
(00:30:20):
It's small stuff, but it tells that person, like, "The people who worked on this were thinking about me as a customer, they built it with me in mind, and that means that it is more likely that this is going to fit my needs than something generic." And that builds up both the brand trust that we've talked about, but also the personality of the company, and makes people want to root for you. And frankly, when you are small, you need everyone rooting for you that you can possibly get.
(00:30:45):
So those little bits of polish that don't take a ton of time are absolutely worth it. The last thing I would say is making sure that in your public communications launches, if you ever talk to press, which some companies can and some companies can't, having more of a point of view than just about your product, you can try and say, like, "We are part of something bigger. Here's the broader circle or movement that we are a part of." It makes it feel more inevitable and more like you're not just self servingly talking about your tiny corner of the world, but that it's actually part of this much bigger trend. It will be more compelling and it feels like you're operating at a different level of sophistication that can be really helpful.
Lenny (00:31:28):
I love that. On the first point, basically, it's attention to detail and obsession with quality is what I'm hearing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:34):
Yes. 
Lenny (00:31:34):
Just to make it clear, this isn't just a tiny team just pushing the stuff out. I imagine most founders would be like, "Yes, I would love, we are going to focus on quality. We'll make sure everything looks great." In reality it always is this trade off against other things they could be doing. 
Zoelle Egner (00:31:50):
Yep. 
Lenny (00:31:50):
What do you think folks can do to help keep that level of quality high? Is it just one person being obsessed and just reviewing everything like a founder? Is having someone like you that's just very detail oriented, just review everything? How do you actually execute that when you have 1,000 things to do?
Zoelle Egner (00:32:05):
100%. I'd say there's one of two approaches and you articulated them here. One is you can have the founder that is the avatar of quality, who is just relentlessly being like, "Hey, we're going to do the 15 minute check. Yes, we're going through it. Yes, I'm going to send you a copy of this email, and someone else going to click every link in it, and make sure they're not broken." Or, you can have someone else be the avatar of that who is in the company. I would say in many of the companies I have worked at, that has been me, because I've been the marketing human who cares. But it doesn't have to be a marketing person, it can be someone on product. It can be, honestly, even someone on customer success if you're willing to let them provide their feedback on the way that you're showing up in the world, which you should because they have fantastic insight. There just needs to be someone. 
(00:32:50):
And I think building that into how you interview can be very helpful, as well. So finding people who understand those trade-offs and that balance, and who are willing to put in the extra 15 minutes, but aren't going to spend an extra week trying to obsessively QA everything. You don't want to go that far. Just who has that bent towards detail can be very helpful. Also, just make yourself a checklist. It doesn't have to be complicated. "Every time we put out a blog post, these are the three things we're going to do. Every time we send out an email, it needs to be seen by at least one other person." None of this is rocket science. You just need to make a little process for yourself, and then it can be very fast and lightweight, but the dividends are worth it, I think.
Lenny (00:33:31):
I like how simple this is, just to look like a bigger company, is just pay attention and focus on the little things. It's not a big, whole thing. [inaudible 00:33:39]
Zoelle Egner (00:33:39):
There are some bigger things you can do if you really need to. My favorite silly example of this is Airtable, back in the day, got roasted on Twitter for having billboards that were not super specific about a specific problem or whatever. They were just billboards that we had out. And everyone was like, "This makes no sense. Why are you doing this? We don't understand." They were actually super effective for us because we had a different goal than everyone thought that we did. 
(00:34:03):
For us, it was all about signaling to some very large companies that we were a legitimate and large enough company that they could trust, and we had geographical concentration in specific areas, because we were in the fashion industry, the media industry in New York, we knew exactly where all of their offices were and we knew if they saw our billboards, walking to work, and then got the request to IT for the budget in order to pay six figures for Airtable, they were more likely to be like, "Oh, it's not just some weird startup we never heard of." Like, "Oh, I've seen that billboard, they must be legitimate." And that sounds really silly, but it wasn't actually that expensive.
(00:34:40):
We got mostly remnant inventory, which is at the end of a particular buying cycle. Sometimes they haven't fully sold everything, and you can get the slightly less good ones that are still maybe where you want them for really cheap. And everyone thinks that you only buy billboards if you're huge. So that small signaling thing was a way for us to make sure that we remove some of the risk of not being able to close deals because we were so small. So you can get creative about it. Most of the time you're not going to do that. Most of the time it's like, "Reread your emails." But you could also push it even further if you need to.
Lenny (00:35:12):
What is that full rough cost of billboards like? Because I think people think about billboards and it's hard to even know what they cost. What's a number?
Zoelle Egner (00:35:20):
It really, really depends, so I'm hesitant to give you a number because which metro you're in, it ranges vastly. I would say you can expect that some of that inventory is in the low thousands of dollars, which is way lower than you might expect.
Lenny (00:35:34):
For one billboard.
Zoelle Egner (00:35:36):
Yeah. So you don't need to get a million. And I'm not suggesting you go get one on 101. Good luck to you on that. That's expensive. But you can get one in a reasonable neighborhood in New York for way less money than you might expect, if you're willing to do remnant.

(00:36:41):
Following this thread a bit, my next question is, and this may be the answer, is when you think about Airtable's growth strategy, growth tactics over time, what would you say are one, or two, or three of the most impactful marketing or growth tactics that work best over time? And maybe billboards are one of them.
Zoelle Egner (00:37:02):
I wouldn't say they were the highest ROI, but they're certainly one of the more interesting things that we did. They were useful, don't get me wrong. But I think maybe some other ones are more interesting. The boring answer that I will caveat this with is that one of the pieces of our acquisition playbook, it was very standard, that did work quite well, was some unconventionally targeted Facebook ads. That era is over. So don't expect that that is going to work for your B2B business now because that that's totally changed.
Lenny (00:37:29):
And when you say unconventional, what do you mean?
Zoelle Egner (00:37:31):
We spent a lot of time thinking about a psychographic profile for our users. So the challenge of Airtable is that you can use it for anything. It can be used in every department within an organization. It can be used for personal stuff, you name it, it has a use, because you're functionally building your own software and you can build software for anything. Unfortunately, if you go out to the market with a message of, like, "Build your own software." The vast majority of people are like, "I want to do that. That sounds hard. That sounds stupid. No." 
(00:38:01):
And so we couldn't really use super generic messaging, but to go really specific into verticals, which we did end up ultimately doing, didn't give us the broad coverage to go find new opportunities. You go really deep into one particular vertical or two particular verticals at a time with a small team, but then we weren't surfacing new opportunities that might be even more important. So we tried to balance that vertical specific work that we did with also trying to find this type of person who we had discovered was going to be the best champion for us. 
(00:38:33):
And this is a tinkerer persona, someone who likes new technology, they like putting together the Lego building blocks of things, and you couldn't really find Tinkerer's Magazine. There's not like a place those people hang out. They don't just have one title. It's a psychographic profile as a type of person that could have many, many different roles. And so instead-
Lenny (00:38:56):
And Facebook doesn't let you do that anymore, right?
Zoelle Egner (00:38:59):
No. You can't target based on-
Lenny (00:39:01):
[inaudible 00:39:01] go.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:02):
... like, "They have a tinkerer mentality," unfortunately. 
Lenny (00:39:04):
Okay, got it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
It's so sad. 
Lenny (00:39:05):
Okay. I see-
Zoelle Egner (00:39:05):
But-
Lenny (00:39:05):
... that it's not possible. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:07):
Yeah. But what you can do is you can say, "That type of person often likes these types of media. We've heard that they often are really into these podcasts, so they're really into reading about this type of personal development." And often that is associated with people who have these broad set of roles but have this typical mentality. So we would find clusters of interests that people might have, that often were shared by those people, and do targeting around that. And then when that worked, they'll look alike based on it.
Lenny (00:39:38):
Did not expect Facebook ads as one of these answers. So that's interesting. 
Zoelle Egner (00:39:42):
No, and it's not a good idea anymore. Don't do it now. 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Disclaimer.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:44):
Back in the day, it was great. Now I would not recommend. But I have some unconventional ones that I can suggest that are- 
Lenny (00:39:44):
Get into it.
Zoelle Egner (00:39:52):
... not Facebook. There's a few different things, but I want to give some context first for people who are not as familiar with Airtable's business, because I do think these are really helpful pieces of context. The first is because of the types of industries that we are often very successful in, had a very similar network effect that we would see, where basically it was within specific professions, we would see people who, in order to distinguish themselves in that job market, would build a brand around the tools that they used, essentially. We found different ways to accelerate their process of identifying those roles, where it was really, really helpful to build a brand for yourself so that you could hop around to different jobs more quickly, accelerate your process, et cetera, and thus bring along a tool with you and evangelize for it a lot. So that's one set of things we were trying to achieve.
(00:40:46):
The second set of things we were trying to achieve that's also useful context here, is although industry virality was really important for us, even more important was inside of company virality, that was the real superpower of Airtable. We'd go from 10 people to 1,000 people a year. And so we were always looking for ways to make that happen within companies in more and more efficient ways.
(00:41:08):
And then the third piece here is no one had a good generic explanation of Airtable that worked for everybody. This is perhaps partially my fault as marketing, but it's also the fault of the fact that the market was not ready for the good, generic explanation to mean anything, like I mentioned before, people just did not care about the generic explanation. And the magic of Airtable was always seen in its specificity. 
(00:41:32):
So we knew if we can get to the right people and we can connect the dots to them to the correct use case, so they want to go and evangelize to improve their careers, they will do that both externally and within their companies, and more importantly within the companies, they'll be able to go to their friends and say, "Hey, I'm using Airtable as a content calendar, but you have a UX research problem. And I understand Airtable enough that I can help you build a system. And now I'm a superhero internally because I helped you build this whole new thing. Look at me, I'm amazing." And they suddenly have fully done a sales pitch for Airtable without us having to do any work or understand their use case, which is great and very necessary when you are as horizontal as we are. So we had to figure out essentially, "How do we catalyze that word of mouth and build champions at scale?"
(00:42:21):
All of that is to say the two interesting things that we did were all around that. In the very early days, what that meant in practice was we literally had a Slack integration that we pulled in a whole bunch of information about anyone who signed up for Airtable, including their title, the company that they worked at, et cetera. And literally would sit there and had a little button in each of the records that came in that would allow us to email them immediately if we had decided that they might be someone we want to talk to. And we set up this whole automated system so that it would take two seconds to reach out to a ton of different people, being like, "Hey, we'd really love to get your feedback and help make sure you're as successful as possible on Airtable." 
(00:43:02):
This is not scalable in the long term because there's a whole bunch of sending emails and doing meetings. But what it meant is that we were able to start building our mental model for what these champions looked like in practice by finding the patterns across them. And building the foundation is what ultimately became our customer success motion very early. And then we were able to say, "Okay, we found five people who have a content calendar use case with this type of title. And now we'll be able to go run an ad campaign based on that. We can build a bunch of templates based on that. Here's all these different hooks we can use, because we know this is what a champion can look like," in a way that was not going to be obvious if we hadn't talked to a ton of people. So it seems really unobvious as an investment, per se, but tremendous number of human hours going into just having an efficient way to talk to as many people as possible to build those mental models. That's number one.
Lenny (00:43:57):
That is fascinating. Essentially, you weren't even sure who would be excited about Airtable. Part of this is like, "Figure out the personas and groups of people that we believe are the right target to encourage and help support." And then part of that is, "Get it spreading within a company once you figure out these folks within a company." It's such a cool idea to just have a feed of ... I imagine the squad had certain attributes of the person, like, "Here's the company they work. Here's how big it is." And then they talk about, there's a mention of what they're using it for. Is that part of this?
Zoelle Egner (00:44:31):
Ideally. Though we were always very privacy minded, so we couldn't actually get much information about what they were doing in Airtable. We could never see their data, because that would be a tremendous failure of trust, to go back to what we were talking about before. So a lot of this, we would have guesses, and maybe we could see that they'd use certain templates but we didn't otherwise really know. And that was part of the reason why we wanted to talk to them in the first place. 
(00:44:54):
The second reason is that if we could talk to them early, we could help them build their first space, and from there, if they were successful, they would have the tools to go and help other people within their organization. So if we catch them at the beginning, make sure one person was successful by over investing in them, then they essentially became support for everybody else. I should also clarify, these were not necessarily people who were going to be the buyers. The buyers and the champions here look very, very different for Airtable, which is a really an interesting dynamic that many companies do not have. But for us, the person who is going to sit down with a glass of wine on a Friday and build an Airtable base was not the person who had the budget who was going to pay for this thing. 
(00:45:36):
And so we weren't initially looking for buyers, we were looking for champions, in part so that we could then go to IT six months down the line and be like, "Look, you have 500 people using this product, it's been very useful for them. It is time for you to pay now." Not sure IT loved those conversations, but they were really effective for us and meant that it was very, very easy to sell.
Lenny (00:45:57):
Fascinating. It makes me think a lot about the product led sales movement and how this is essentially that, but even earlier, because it's people just signed up and they're just helping them be successful, versus like, "This company's got 14 people using it. You should go try to sell them on an enterprise contract." Essentially this was a tool to help you figure out how to, basically scaling customer success and helping you prioritize who to go after, and being very hands-on with the strongest potential future big buyers.
Zoelle Egner (00:46:24):
Exactly. And I think what's interesting here is it helped us bootstrap two things. One was, to your point, building out the personas, and champions, and so on. And ultimately there's more scalable ways to reach those people in the long run. But secondarily, it also helped us deal with a real product education problem that we had in the early days. Because it was really complicated. Airtable, unfortunately, has two education issues that it needs to solve. It's not just, "How do I put the Lego blocks together?" It is also, "How do I design a piece of software and a workflow?"
(00:47:01):
And unfortunately if you're selling to content marketing manager or a UX researcher, there's no guarantee that they know how to make a workflow. Most software is opinionated, and it does that work for you, and you're like, "It either works for you or it doesn't." And maybe you're frustrated about what it forces you to do in order to work, but you can't really control it, which means when suddenly, you have the ability to create whatever workflow that you want, there's actually some education that needs to go into it in order to be able to make that successful. 
(00:47:28):
It's not enough to just make an Airtable base that's pretty or that functions. You can't get your team to use it effectively if it doesn't fit into the broader context of the organization. It's still going to fail. And so a lot of this was us figuring out, like, "Okay, how do we help these people not only use our product but build something that is going to be durable, so that we do see that growth, so they don't see it as a failure, so it doesn't fail at that second order moment when it starts to get spread out to more people?"
Lenny (00:47:53):
It's a really good tactic for any SaaS product that just is hard to understand and needs, Airtable had both problems. Like, "I don't know what this is for and I don't know exactly how it's going to fit into my workflow." Imagine most-
Zoelle Egner (00:48:05):
But-
Lenny (00:48:05):
... companies still have to deal with both those problems. 
Zoelle Egner (00:48:07):
No, hopefully not. Hopefully not. 
Lenny (00:48:07):
Yeah.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:08):
But once you actually get in with folks, it's very difficult to remove it. So suddenly your retention rates are incredible, your word of mouth is incredible, if you're willing to do that initial work. A lot of people think that Airtable was a pure product led growth company, and missed that huge customer success component that was always very, very important in the early days. And that helped us ultimately move more towards that PLG motion for a while, but was essential to getting it set up in the first place.
Lenny (00:48:35):
Fascinating.
Zoelle Egner (00:48:36):
The other one that we did related to this champions at scale was we spent a hilarious amount of money on really fancy swag. I know this sounds silly, but branded AirPods level of fancy swag. Admittedly more people were in the office back then. Now they are more remote and this would not work as well. But back in the day, if you gave people something really good, not a pen or a sticker, really good, they would show it off to absolutely everyone that they talked to, because they were so excited they got branded AirPods. People would ask about it, walking by their desks. It sounds so like trivial. But for that couple hundred bucks that we spent knowing like, "Hey, this person's already a champion and if someone asks them, they're going to give a really good pitch." Totally worth it. Sometimes better to not skimp on swag. Hard to measure, very effective.
Lenny (00:49:27):
That's a great tip. And it connects to the general idea of find your champions and just do a lot to make sure they're successful, excited, want to evangelize, and an AirPod here and there feel like a really good ROI investment.
Zoelle Egner (00:49:40):
Was for us.
Lenny (00:49:41):
Anything else along those lines?
Zoelle Egner (00:49:42):
I think those are the big ones that I would highlight. The only other small note I would make from a process perspective is if you are going to overinvest in customer success, which I recommend, make sure that you have also set up a process to take the insights that your customer success people are coming up with and turn them into as much content as you can. Because that's where you're going to find scale in the long run. So for us, what that meant was we would talk to a bunch of customers and then customer success would have helped them build bases, and then we would create templates. So were not exact copies, because we're not trying to steal their intellectual property. We would say, "What is the fundamental workflow here, that other companies might have? How do we make a template that is useful from this?" And some blog posts that explain it, whatever else, that we can then put out into the market. 
(00:50:25):
And the next time a smaller company that's not a Fortune 500 wants this sort of thing, someone can just email them that template and we don't have to go through this whole build process, they have something to start with. If you can find those insights and put them genuinely into use as a little conveyor belt, it will be much easier to scale. It will be much easier to come up with genuinely compelling content because it's coming from your customers, so they already care about it. You have strong signal that's going to be valuable if you already built it for them. Use that to your advantage, make that into a little machine. And it makes all of the go-to market that you need to do later easier.
Lenny (00:50:57):
I know that you have the strong opinion that customer success and marketing are basically the same thing and should be maybe one team. Can you speak to that?
Zoelle Egner (00:51:05):
Yeah. This is my spicy opinion, but both of them have to do the same things. They have to identify customer needs. They have to help the customers see your product as a solution to those needs. They need to remove friction from the process of getting value. They are hopefully both encouraging those customers to share with other people, and both of them should be engaged in translating insights from those individuals into resources that can help everybody. 
(00:51:31):
They use different tactics. Marketing is going to use more scalable tactics. Customer success is going to be in the weeds, really talking to individual people, but all of the things they care about are actually the same thing. They just use different ways to do it. And if you, as a marketer, are not pretty confident in being able to say, like, "What I'm doing is getting the right people to get genuine value from this product," so much so that they want to tell other people about it because it's going to make them look good, then maybe figure out if there's ways to bring more of that to your process, because it will make what you are doing more effective.
(00:52:05):
And frankly, there's not a better evangelist than a person whose career you have materially helped to improve based on matching the right person to the solution so that they can have more impact at their company. So much said, one of my unofficial metrics for both marketing and customer success at Airtable, unofficial, was how many people we'd gotten promoted for using the product. I had a running tally of those people, and I knew if we were getting those at the major accounts we were trying to win, something good was happening and we were going to be successful with really large deals.
Lenny (00:52:36):
So curious how you tracked that. I guess you just check in with them occasionally?
Zoelle Egner (00:52:40):
No, I had my CSMs literally, they had really strong relationships. We were actually tracking it. It was a little embarrassing, but it worked really well.
Lenny (00:52:47):
I love it, with the great KPI. It's like dating apps and how many people get married, I guess.
Zoelle Egner (00:52:52):
Exactly. 
Lenny (00:52:53):
Zooming out a little bit, you advise a lot of companies on marketing, customer success, growth, and things like that. Maybe there's a two part question, and see where you want to take it. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:03):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:53:03):
One is just what are activities that marketing, and growth, and customer success teams often do that are impactful and consistently impactful, things that you think startups should invest in that maybe they aren't, or they already aren't and they should definitely keep doing this. And on the flip side, things that don't work, things that maybe they should avoid. So maybe let's start there and there's going to be a followup. 
Zoelle Egner (00:53:26):
Cool. Okay. I'm going to start with things to avoid, because I try and not to make too many blanket statements on this, but I have a couple that I am willing to make. So this is all with the caveat that channel market fit is really real, and sometimes these things might work for you. Don't discount just because I say that they don't work for me. There are certain types of flashy event marketing and sponsorships that you will get relentlessly invited to do, that will seem like they're going to be really great for signaling purposes, or for leads, or whatever. 
(00:53:55):
And they're almost always a waste of your time, unless you are in an industry where you desperately need to get to a trade show, because that's where everyone hangs out. At that point, yeah, of course you're going to have to go do that. But if you're in more standard B2B SaaS, or that's not really a thing, there are better ways to get in front of those people than having your logo out there. That doesn't tell them anything. Maybe you get a branded session at the conference or whatever, but who's going to go to that branded session? Probably not that many people. And then you will have spent so much money and gotten nothing for it. Go to the event, do not fund your money on the sponsorship. It's stupid. And then the second one, which is definitely a very spicy opinion, but I'm going to go there. 
Lenny (00:54:40):
Go there. 
Zoelle Egner (00:54:41):
A lot of people think that the epitome of product marketing is creating your own category. And while I agree that it is useful to have strong differentiators, because it is, I think creating a category, getting a new thing in Gartner or whatever, is often a waste of your time. It is a huge lift, absolutely enormous, particularly in B2B SaaS, and I'm not always sure that it's helpful to have your super teeny tiny, little niche over here where you're like, "Oh, we have no competitors." That's not actually how buyers work. It's not really worth it. 
(00:55:21):
That said, there are things you can do that feel like category creation that are actually effective, and that I do think make more sense. And specifically if you can elevate a profession instead of a category, that can make way more sense. So the great example of this is that Gainsight creating customer success or many companies altogether carving out DevOps, or rebranding DevOps, to be a thing that was suddenly a sexy job to have. 
(00:55:47):
And I think that's valuable because a job is an identity and people will fight for an identity. A category of software is a line item on your budget. No one is excited about that. But people are very excited about their job being meaningful, and their job being important, and being taken seriously. And so if you could hold up either an existing or a brand new job and say, "This is really important for much broader business metrics, whatever else. We're going to create community for those people to come together and it's all about the job," and not about you. That can be very powerful and they'll take them with you. You become part of the identity of that career. Amazing. Do that, for sure. But like the Gartner Square, there's some opportunities for that where it makes sense. A lot of the times it doesn't. Don't do that.
Lenny (00:56:34):
Amazing. I love that. Is there more you wanted to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (00:56:34):
No. 
Lenny (00:56:34):
Okay.
Zoelle Egner (00:56:39):
I think that's enough on not to do.
Lenny (00:56:40):
What this reminds me of broadly is just, "Stay focused on the customer and their problems. Don't obsess with who you are, who are you selling to and how will you make their life better." Reminds me of this old idea from Kathy Sierra. Does that ring a bell? 
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:56:55):
Where-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:55):
Oh totally. 
Lenny (00:56:56):
... you make your customer a superhero, you want them to feel like a superhero. And if they-
Zoelle Egner (00:56:56):
It works-
Lenny (00:56:59):
... feel like a superhero. And yeah, that sounds like that's essentially what you did with Airtable, a lot of these companies you worked with.
Zoelle Egner (00:57:05):
That that is always the goal. Like, "How can you make them the hero of the story and not you? Because no one cares about your company, what they care about is themselves, frankly."
Lenny (00:57:12):
Are there any products or companies you think of off the top of your head that are really good at this, that are just like they nailed this?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:18):
Yeah, that's a good question. Certainly the two that I mentioned, that helped rebrand some of the professions, so like the Gainsights of the world. I'm blanking a little bit on the ones that have done this for DevOps really effectively, but there's certainly some that have.
Lenny (00:57:32):
Maybe Datadog?
Zoelle Egner (00:57:33):
Yeah, Datadog has done a pretty good job of that. I think where I get excited is when the companies do this in a way that feels less self-serving, or less obviously self-serving. And that means that sometimes you have to be willing to invest in things that will not have super obviously immediate ROI for you, but they will for the community, and for building the community. Oh, actually one really good example, I think Notion has actually done a pretty good job of this. People are really, really invested in the templates that they create, because it feels like you're not pushing Notion, you're pushing the beautiful creation that you have to solve a problem. I think they've done a really nice job on that process, and several of their competitors, I think have done a pretty decent job as well, but they certainly come to mind.
Lenny (00:58:18):
Thinking of templates, I know Airtable, known for templates, and you've mentioned this being a big part of the success, and I imagine a lot of companies now are just creating templates left, because they imagine that's the core, what helped a lot of these companies, Notion being an example. What is your take on the power and importance of templates for software?
Zoelle Egner (00:58:38):
I think they can be tremendously helpful if you are horizontal because they help to narrow the surface area for a user, so they understand how to connect the dots between their problem and your product. And if it is not obvious to someone how they can solve a specific problem, they're going to be like, "Oh, hey, that seems really cool. When I think of something I'll definitely come back." And then you have lost them. And so if you can be like, "Here are three templates that a person you might be excited about." That can be really helpful. Where people sometimes get confused about templates, or have the wrong expectations about templates, is when they think that templates are going to be an acquisition mechanism, and they don't build in the foundation that is necessary for that to be true. So a lot of people think that templates were what drove Airtable's top of funnel. That is not the case. 
(00:59:27):
I was having a conversation with someone who worked a lot on SEO at Airtable in the much later days, and laughing over the fact that people thought that was a big source of traffic, because it was not. We did not optimize them for that. Good luck finding them in search most of the time. Not at all useful. Where they were helpful, narrowing that surface area, helping with matching patterns, helping people understand how the product worked, super helpful. Expansion within companies, tremendously useful. 
(00:59:55):
But they were not a top of funnel mechanism for us, because we didn't put the work in to do that. We did not have an SEO engine. We weren't Zapier. Zapier has done a great job with that. They get a ton of traffic because they built it as a programmatic SEO play, but you have to be clear about what your goals are and what problem they're solving, because otherwise it is very easy to be like, "I'll just build a bunch of templates, and then all of the leads will appear," And that's not going to happen unless you invest in a lot more than at least Airtable did. So it can be useful to build them, know what you're doing it for, and how you're going to measure it, or otherwise you'll waste your time.
Lenny (01:00:29):
Do you think Airtable could have taken advantage of that top of funnel approach if they invested from an SEO perspective or do you think it wasn't an opportunity that worked?
Zoelle Egner (01:00:37):
I think it could have been. We would've needed to hire more humans. Airtable was an incredibly lean team for a very, very long time. From 2015, when I joined, until 2017 or 2018, we had barely 50 people. It was small for many, many years and so we had to make really difficult choices about what to prioritize and what not to prioritize. Should we have hired more people and done more things? I would argue in retrospect, absolutely, yes, there were opportunities that were left on the table, but in early days you leave good opportunities because you have to focus on other things.
Lenny (01:01:13):
Got it. And so a takeaway here is templates could be really useful for customer success versus SEO top of funnel. Right? That's-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:13):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:01:20):
... where they became powerful. 
Zoelle Egner (01:01:21):
Still maybe helpful. Maybe for you, it makes sense to do the SEO play, just know that that is not a small play. It is an investment. It is not and not just like, "Have some people make some templates." You got to do way more than just that. It's not going to be sufficient.
Lenny (01:01:35):
Final potential question, depending on where this goes, and I'm curious how spicy this answer gets, and-
Zoelle Egner (01:01:35):
Oh boy.
Lenny (01:01:40):
It's around launches and PR. You work with a lot of startups, I imagine founders are always trying to plan a launch, get PR. I'm curious your take on the value of investing a bunch of resources in a big launch, the value of just getting PR as an early stage startup.
Zoelle Egner (01:01:56):
Yeah, just getting PR is not a good goal. I know that's been well stated in the market, but just to reiterate it, most of the time PR is not going to get you leads or users, it's just not. And you have to think about when you are creating a launch or doing a piece of PR, what are the breadcrumbs that bring someone back to something that can actually convert? If you have your big tech crunch piece and it's super exciting, it says all these great things about you, and it maybe links to you once, somewhere in the 12th paragraph or whatever, how many people are actually going to click on that link? Not that many people. How many people are going to read that and remember to go Google it? Not as many as you want. Okay? There's going to be so much coming out of the funnel, it is not a useful acquisition mechanism.
(01:02:43):
What it is good for is credibility. And that's where, if you have really clear goals, and you know how you are ready to leverage the asset of a piece of PR coverage, then it can be helpful to you. So the two goals I always recommend to founders when thinking about using PR, are either hiring or maybe improving the response rate for your cold outbound. Those are the two that I think make the most sense, because in both cases they have a different distribution mechanism. In hiring, you're going to include that in an email that you're sending to a candidate. And so it's going to increase the likelihood that they take you seriously, and get excited about the company, and maybe actually end up ultimately joining your team. 
(01:03:22):
Cold outbound, you're using it as credibility to say, "Hey, we're a real company you can trust." Great. Both of those things are all emails that you are proactively sending. You know exactly who they're going to, and you know that asset is going to have, hopefully, the impact that you're looking for, and you can measure whether it makes a difference or not. But just getting a piece of PR, to get a piece of PR is like it'll help with your internal morale, but I'm not sure it's going to do much help for you. So have really clear goals and have realistic goals, or you will be disappointed.
(01:03:51):
Launches however, do not need to just be about PR. In fact, in many cases PR is a distraction, and instead you can have not just one big launch but a series of launches that allow you to stay top of mind, to create momentum with your users, and to show up in lots of different places because audiences respond to novelty, it gives them a reason to care about your company. And so have your big, annual launch or whatever, but also have one two months from then, and another one, and another one. Find ways to use that novelty to your advantage and to get into communities that you think are going to be good fits for your company.
Lenny (01:04:26):
I love that advice. Any final thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Zoelle Egner (01:04:34):
Mostly just all of this is easier if you talk to your customers more. Build a system for yourself that will allow you to have those touchpoints. That's not just making everyone answer customer support tickets, though I do think that is a great idea, because it gives so much empathy and it's really helpful. You as a founder, if you're a founder, or a product manager, or whatever else, should find a way to get that on your calendar weekly or monthly. Go talk to people, it makes it better. You will have a better mental model. The other thing is strongly consider investing in customer success if you are a B2B company, early. Airtable had it before sales, which is a very unconventional approach, but early is worth it. It has huge dividends if you actually listen to them. If you're not going to listen to them, though, don't hire them, because that's sad.
Lenny (01:05:22):
I have followup questions on the customer success piece, say someone wants to invest in customer success, is there a resource, or person, or anything that you could point folks to, to understand and think about how to do this well?
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
There's a lot for people within that profession. There's not as much for founders out there right now, unfortunately. This is an area that I very eagerly am looking for more resources to share with people. Minimally. I'll say, if you care about this, send me a message. I will give you some advice. All of our industry will be better if there are more people working on customer success. So I will help you. Send me a note. Otherwise, I'll try and dig out some other things and maybe you can share them, but there's not a ton. So people in customer success, please share your learnings more with founders. All of us-
Lenny (01:05:36):
Have-
Zoelle Egner (01:05:36):
... would like to see it.
Lenny (01:06:09):
Yeah, I've actually been looking for someone to write a guest post in the newsletter, about just how to set up a customer success team. And so if you're listening, you think you could be that person. Let me-
Zoelle Egner (01:06:21):
Yeah, I have some people that I will not put on the spot right now, that I will send your way that I think- [inaudible 01:06:26]
Lenny (01:06:26):
Amazing. [inaudible 01:06:27]. Let's make this happen.
Zoelle Egner (01:06:28):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:29):
And then I wanted to ask you a question on the first piece of advice, which is, "Founders talk to the customers more often." Is there one tactical piece of advice you could recommend for how to do that?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:37):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:06:37):
How to find a customer, how to set it up consistently?
Zoelle Egner (01:06:40):
Totally. The simplest way to do this is to write a template email for yourself that you can send out very easily, that essentially says like, "Hey, thank you so much for using the product. I would really love to hear about your experience so far and get your feedback. Do you have 10 minutes to talk on the phone?" I know it is important that it's on the phone and not a survey because you get way more instinct from unstructured conversation than you're going to get from sending them three things in a Google survey.
(01:07:05):
Set it up, come up with a hypothesis of the type of person that you want to talk to and then run a query against your database, find someone and send three of those emails a week. And it's not exciting, but you can automate most of it and it will be helpful. None of this stuff has to be complicated. You just got to have a system.
Lenny (01:07:23):
Great advice. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:27):
Yes.
Lenny (01:07:27):
I've got six questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, let's see where it goes. 
Zoelle Egner (01:07:34):
Okay.
Lenny (01:07:34):
Question number one. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
Zoelle Egner (01:07:40):
Okay, I hate this question because I take pride in making highly targeted recommendations, but I will do it anyway. I'm pretty sure you mostly talk to product and growth people. Right now, obviously, AI is a big topic of conversation, so here are two books that will enrich your mental model for artificial intelligence and encourage you to think about it from different perspectives. The first one, a little bit academic, highly recommend it, though. It's a book called Computing Taste by Nick Seaver. 
(01:08:09):
He's a professor of anthropology and he did this study of people and companies who build music recognition algorithms. And it's a really interesting book for a bunch of reasons, including that it's a academic take on both tech culture, and more specifically, the unspoken and underlying assumptions that many workers who are building in this space have. It can be a little spicy and uncomfortable for a person in tech to read, but I think it is a fascinating perspective and very relevant to the stuff that's going on in AI right now. So go check it out. Computing Taste by Nick Seaver.
(01:08:42):
The second is a fiction book, but the Ancillary Justice series by Anne Leckie, about a spaceship AI that ends up separated from its ship and trapped in a body. I'm going to leave it at that. Worth reading for a different way of thinking about AI.
Lenny (01:08:56):
I think we need a Zoelle full episode on book recommendations. These are amazing. Let's keep going.
Zoelle Egner (01:08:56):
So fair.
Lenny (01:09:02):
What other podcast of yours that you love to listen to other than this podcast?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:07):
Probably either Happiness Lab or Gastropod. I love food and also psychology, one of those two.
Lenny (01:09:13):
Interesting. Okay, we'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:17):
Movie, Everything Everywhere All at Once. And TV show, there's a Korean drama called Extraordinary Attorney Woo. That, I really enjoyed.
Lenny (01:09:26):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask?
Zoelle Egner (01:09:29):
Yeah. Okay, so this one is related to customer success. It's my favorite question of all. People hate it, sorry. But I like to ask anyone who's going to be in a customer facing role, who needs to be able to keep their cool, and also learn stuff on the fly, and respond to customers, to solve an unfamiliar problem using Zapier. And they can use the internet to look things up, whatever, but I basically lay out for them a problem that I, as the customer want to solve, and have them build it for me live. This both is surprising for most people, so you get to see how they respond to an unfamiliar situation, which every client will give you at some point, and it shows how they learn things in a very concrete way, which is really interesting. So check it out. It works really well for customer success.
Lenny (01:10:10):
I've not heard that one before. Fascinating. Top five SaaS products that you enjoy and an Airtable cannot be one?
Zoelle Egner (01:10:18):
Ugh. Okay, then I'll try and avoid any company that I have worked for. I really like using Figma. It's nice when designers let me play with things. I've been really enjoying working with Webflow, also means that I can do stuff on my own. This is maybe spicy, but I actually love Google Docs. I'm not a Notion's fan stand, sorry.
Lenny (01:10:18):
Hey.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
But Google Docs-
Lenny (01:10:37):
Can't [inaudible 01:10:37] them all.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:36):
... is like my best friend.
Lenny (01:10:37):
Google Docs is great.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:38):
Yeah. And then there is a personal CRM company that I invested in, so sorry, maybe this is not allowed, but called Clay, and it is the only way I've ever been able to keep track of my-
Lenny (01:10:47):
Wow. [inaudible 01:10:47]-
Zoelle Egner (01:10:47):
... relationships in a real way.
Lenny (01:10:48):
Clay's great product.
Zoelle Egner (01:10:49):
They're the best. And then I don't know if I love it, but I use Zoom so much that I feel like I must say it, because I spend so much of my time on it and it's categorically better than Google Meet.
Lenny (01:11:01):
Final question, favorite book, course, article, any resource on marketing that non marketers can learn from?
Zoelle Egner (01:11:10):
Okay, it's a newsletter. Does that work?
Lenny (01:11:12):
Absolutely.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:13):
Amazing. Okay, so there is a specialist VC firm called MKT1. It's run by Emily Kramer and Kathleen Estreich, sorry if I pronounced your last name, there, wrong, Kathleen. It's all about marketing. They are marketing experts and operators who now invest, but they make the best frameworks that you can immediately apply. And there's templates and all sorts of super, super tactical stuff, which a lot of tactical marketing content is terrible because it's actually content marketing for some bad platform. Theirs is not. It is genuinely good. Go check it out. 
Lenny (01:11:43):
A huge fan. Emily has been on the podcast. 
Zoelle Egner (01:11:45):
Oh, [inaudible 01:11:47].
Lenny (01:11:47):
Yeah. And I look at that newsletter as the Lenny's newsletter of marketing, and it's exactly how you described.
Zoelle Egner (01:11:53):
It's the best.
Lenny (01:11:53):
Huge fan. Great recommendation. With that, Zoelle, thank you so much for being here. This was a lot of fun. And we got through a lot of stuff, which makes me really happy. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:09):
I am on Twitter @Zoelle. I'm also on LinkedIn, so I live there, come find me there. Otherwise, how can you be useful to me? Mostly like go forth and believe in customer success, and talk to your users, number one, because I am an avid user of technology, and I want it all to be better. Number two, no, that's all I got. Just go do those things and I will be so happy. Also, if you want to talk about customer success, anytime, hit me up. I'm here.
Lenny (01:12:35):
I'm going to add a couple more things, which you mentioned to me offline, that you're hiring at Block Party.
Zoelle Egner (01:12:39):
Yes.
Lenny (01:12:39):
You're hiring growth people, PMs, engineers, and then you're also advising on the side with marketing customer success. Anything else you want to add, there?
Zoelle Egner (01:12:48):
Yeah, absolutely. Love advising early stage companies. I'm especially helpful for pre seed and seed, usually, anything PLG, positioning, messaging, figuring out your channels, experimentation, all that early, fun stuff. I love it. Happy to help anytime. And we are hiring across all of the teams, but especially mine. So if you would like to come and do all sorts of fun experimentation, and also help keep people online safe, come look up, Block Party. I'd love to have you on my team. 
Lenny (01:13:18):
Blockparty.com, or where do folks- [inaudible 01:13:19]
Zoelle Egner (01:13:18):
Blockpartyapp.com. Did not-
Lenny (01:13:18):
App.com
Zoelle Egner (01:13:19):
... get blockparty.com. 
Lenny (01:13:19):
You didn't. Zoelle, thank you. Very good.
Zoelle Egner (01:13:23):
